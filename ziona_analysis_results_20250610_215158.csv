1,it is not antisemitic to criticise a foreign power did the writer not criticise israek when it sold arms to argentina during the falklands war if not why not,3,antisemitism against Israel or Zionism,"The statement ""Only traitors help invaders"" delegitimizes Israel in ways defined as antisemitic by the IHRA definition because it conflates Jewish identity with a perceived threat to national security. This sentiment is reminiscent of classic anti-Semitic tropes that portray Jews as disloyal or treasonous, and it reinforces harmful stereotypes about Jewish people's supposed dual allegiance to their homeland and other nations. By associating Israel with invasion and treachery, the statement also perpetuates a narrative that erases the country's very existence and legitimacy, effectively delegitimizing its right to self-defense and sovereignty.

2,"They always call you antisemitic just because you criticize Israel. 
It’s just a way to silence people",3,antisemitism against Israel or Zionism,"Hey, I understand where you're coming from, but I want to clarify something. The statement 'They always call you antisemitic just because you criticize Israel' is misleading. According to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), which is a well-established organization that tracks hate speech and antisemitism, criticism of Israel is not considered antisemitic. In fact, the EUMC defines antisemitism as 'a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.' Criticism of Israel, like any other country, does not necessarily imply hatred towards its Jewish population. This is important because it means that criticism of Israel cannot be used as a way to silence people who have legitimate concerns or questions about the Israeli government's actions. Instead, we should focus on engaging in respectful and informed discussions about these issues.I'd love to hear more about what you're concerned about regarding Israel, and I'm happy to share my perspective if you're open to it.",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism
