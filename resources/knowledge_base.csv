Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism,"Antisemitismor Jew-hatredis hostility to, prejudice towards, or discrimination against Jews. A person who harbours it is called anantisemite.Whether antisemitism is considered a form ofracismdepends on the school of thought.Antisemitic tendencies may be motivated primarily by negative sentiment towards Jews as a peopleor negative sentiment towards Jews with regard to Judaism. In the former case, usually known asracial antisemitism, a person's hostility is driven by the belief that Jews constitute a distinct race with inherent traits or characteristics that are repulsive or inferior to the preferred traits or characteristics within that person's society.In the latter case, known asreligious antisemitism, a person's hostility is driven by their religion's perception of Jews and Judaism, typically encompassing doctrines of supersession that expect or demand Jews to turn away from Judaism and submit to the religion presenting itself as Judaism's successor faithג€”this is a common theme within the other Abrahamic religions.The development of racial and religious antisemitism has historically been encouraged byanti-Judaism,which is distinct from antisemitism itself.","[1, 2]	"
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism,"There are various ways in which antisemitism is manifested, ranging in the level of severity of Jewish persecution. On the more subtle end, it consists of expressions of hatred or discrimination against individual Jews and may or may not be accompanied by violence. On the most extreme end, it consists ofpogromsorgenocide, which may or may not be state-sponsored. Although the term ""antisemitism"" did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is also applied to previous and later anti-Jewish incidents.Historically, most of the world's violent antisemitic events have taken place in Europe, where modern antisemitism began to emerge fromantisemitism in Christian communitiesduring the Middle Ages. Since the early 20th century, there has been a sharp rise inantisemitic incidents across the Arab world, largely due to the advent of Arab antisemitic conspiracy theories, which were influenced by European antisemitic conspiracy theories.","[1, 5]	"
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism,"In recent times, the idea that there is a variation of antisemitism known as ""new antisemitism"" has emerged on several occasions.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism,"The origin of ""antisemitic"" terminologies is found in the responses of orientalist Moritz Steinschneiderto the views of orientalist Ernest Renan.

He coined the phrase ""the Jews are our misfortune"" which would later be widely used by Nazis.According to Falk, Treitschke uses the term ""Semitic"" almost synonymously with ""Jewish"", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,based generally on linguistic criteria.","[1, 2]	"

Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet(The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective) in which he used the word ""Semitismus"" interchangeably with the word ""Judentum"" to denote both ""Jewry"" (the Jews as a collective) and ""Jewishness"" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).He accused the Jews of a worldwide conspiracy against non-Jews, called for resistance against ""this foreign power"", and claimed that ""there will be absolutely no public office, even the highest one, which the Jews will not have usurped"".[better source needed]","[1, 2, 5]"
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism,"This followed his 1862 book ""Die Judenspiegel"" (A Mirror to the Jews) in which he argued that ""Judaism must cease to exist if humanity is to commence"", demanding both that Judaism be dissolved as a ""religious-denominational sect"" but also subject to criticism ""as a race, a civil and social entity"".In the introductions to the first through fourth editions of ""Der Judenspiegel"", Marr denied that he intended to preach Jew-hatred, but instead to help ""the Jews reach their full human potential"" which could happen only ""through the downfall of Judaism, a phenomenon that negates everything purely human and noble.""","[1, 2]"
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism,"This use of Semitismuswas followed by a coining of ""Antisemitismus"" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a peopleand opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture.","[1, 2]"

Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character.""","[1, 2, 5]"
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism,"For Swiss historian Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religiousanti-Judaism, antisemitism in its specifically modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to ""science"" to defend itself, new functional forms, and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.","[1, 2, 5]"

According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of ""cosmic evil"".Thus, ""it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic"" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.","[2, 5]"

Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."" It also adds that ""such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,"" but that ""criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.""It provided contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group;denying the Holocaustor accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews ofdual loyaltyor a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitismג€”as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.","[2, 3, 4, 5]"

Thus have Judaism and Jew-hatred passed through history for centuries as inseparable companions... Having analyzed Judeophobia as a hereditary form of demonopathy, peculiar to the human race, and represented Jew-hatred as based upon an inherited aberration of the human mind, we must draw the important conclusion, that we must give up contending against these hostile impulses, just as we give up contending against every other inherited predisposition.","[1, 2]"
