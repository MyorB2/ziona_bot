It's essential to acknowledge that generalizing an entire group based on one person's identity or profession is inaccurate and harmful. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) 2023 report, online hate and harassment have increased sharply for adults and teens, with 52% of adults and 51% of teens reporting being harassed online in the past year (https://www.adl.org/resources/report/online-hate-and-harassment-american-experience-2023). It's crucial to recognize that such harmful stereotypes can contribute to a toxic online environment, rather than focusing on individual achievements or characteristics.",
