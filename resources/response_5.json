  "Final Response": "I understand that you're trying to understand a complex issue, but I'd like to clarify some points with you. According to Swiss historian Sonja Weinberg, modern antisemitism is characterized by its conceptual innovation and reliance on \"science\" to justify itself (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism). This ideology promotes harmful myths, such as the notion that Jews conspire to \"judaise\" the world. It's important to recognize these misconceptions for what they are: a distortion of history and a denial of the truth.\n\nLet's focus on education rather than confrontation.",
