  "Final Response": "I'm here to help you understand why certain statements delegitimize Israel in ways defined as antisemitic by the IHRA definition. According to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), antisemitism is a form of hatred that targets Jews because they are Jewish.\n\nThe statements in question legitimize violence against Israeli citizens, including embassy staff, due to their nationality or political beliefs. This delegitimizes Israel and can be considered antisemitic, as it targets Jews based on their national identity or political affiliations.
