While it may indirectly contribute to a broader understanding of the importance of combating antisemitism, it does not specifically address indirect forms of antisemitism.\n\nOverall, I would rate this educational document as having limited utility in directly countering specific types of antisemitic narratives. However, it may still be useful in providing general information about IHRA's work and promoting Holocaust education, which can indirectly contribute to a broader understanding of the importance of combating antisemitism."
