This hatred was at the foundation of the Holocaust. But, antisemitism did not begin or end with the Holocaust. Antisemitism has existed for thousands of years. It has often taken the form of systemic discrimination against and persecution of Jews. Antisemitism has repeatedly led to serious and deadly violence against Jewish people. Key Facts 1 Antisemitism is a set of hateful beliefs and ideas with deep historical, social, and cultural roots. Over many centuries, Christianity played a central role in the development and spread of antisemitism in Europe, where Jews have always been a minority. 2 Today, antisemitic ideas and stereotypes are held by people of all different backgrounds and religions, as well as from across the political spectrum. 3 Antisemitism often takes the forms of scapegoating and conspiracy theories based on stereotypes and tropes. These theories falsely portray Jewish people as dangerous to society or even the world.

It is a form of bigotry and racism. For centuries, antisemites have demonized and dehumanized Jews by spreading antisemitic tropes, stereotypes, and conspiracy theories. Antisemitism is a set of hateful beliefs and ideas about Jews and the Jewish religion, Judaism. It is based on old and widespread prejudices. However, the word Ã¢Â€ÂœantisemitismÃ¢Â€Â is much newer. It was coined in German as Ã¢Â€Âœ Antisemitismus Ã¢Â€Â in the late 1800s. In English, antisemitism is sometimes spelled Ã¢Â€Âœanti-semitism,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Âœanti-Semitism,Ã¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœanti semitism.Ã¢Â€Â Antisemitism drove the Holocaust . The Holocaust (1933Ã¢Â€Â“1945) was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million European Jews by Nazi Germany and its allies and collaborators. The Nazis incited people to commit genocide by drawing on centuries of antisemitic prejudices and hatreds. But antisemitism did not begin or end with the Holocaust. For centuries, people of different religions, socio-economic statuses, political views, and national backgrounds have expressed or acted on the basis of antisemitic prejudices and beliefs. Antisemitism frequently culminates in discrimination and violence against Jews. In Europe, anti-Jewish prejudices and hatreds date back to ancient times and to early Christianity. For centuries, Jews were a minority, often persecuted, in many European kingdoms, empires, and countries. Prejudices against Jews were a pervasive part of European life and thought during the Middle Ages (circa 500Ã¢Â€Â“1400) ; in the early modern era (circa 1400Ã¢Â€Â“1789) ; and in the 18th and 19th centuries (1700Ã¢Â€Â“1900) when many countries started to modernize and become more secular. By the start of the 20th century, many antisemitic stereotypes, misconceptions, and myths were well-established and widely accepted by people in Germany and other European societies. This systemic hatred made the Holocaust (1933Ã¢Â€Â“1945) possible. Media Essay Antisemitism: Oral History Excerpts (Media Essay) Antisemitism is the prejudice against or hatred of Jewish people.

Although at times Helen was too weak to walk, she and her older sister survived Auschwitz , forced labor at a camp munitions factory, and Bergen-Belsen . AntisemitismÃ¢Â€Â™s Christian Roots Antisemitism has its roots in the anti-Judaism of ancient times and early Christianity. Many stereotypes and conspiracies about Jews can be traced back to early and medieval Christian teachings and practices. Early Christians taught that Christianity had replaced Judaism and that Jews were no longer GodÃ¢Â€Â™s chosen people. They claimed that Jews were stubborn and blind to the truth because they did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. These ideas shaped ChristiansÃ¢Â€Â™ mistrust and animosity toward Jews for many centuries. 1 Footnote 1 1 Other Christian beliefs or themes that gave rise to the earliest expressions of anti-Jewish prejudices include: the false charge that Jews killed Jesus, which was reinforced in official Christian teachings ; 2 Footnote 2 2 the apostle Judas IscariotÃ¢Â€Â™s betrayal of Jesus as symbolic of alleged Jewish treachery and greed ; 3 Footnote 3 3 Christian accusations of Jews as working with or being the devil ; 4 Footnote 4 4 and false accusations of Jews performing Ã¢Â€Âœritual murderÃ¢Â€Â of Christian children, a lie known as Ã¢Â€Âœ blood libel .Ã¢Â€Â These ideas are no longer actively promoted by most Christian churches and denominations. However, they influenced attitudes towards Jews for centuries. Thus, Christianity and Christian ideas about Jews formed the foundation of antisemitism. Antisemitism became pervasive in Christian-influenced societies throughout Europe and the world, even in places where few or no Jews lived. Today, antisemitism is also widespread in societies that are not predominantly Christian. Secular (Non-Religious) Antisemitism Artifact Der StÃƒÂ¼rmer, number 29, July 1934 (Artifact) Nazi GermanyÃ¢Â€Â™s semi-official and fiercely antisemitic newspaper Der StÃƒÂ¼rmer warned of a Jewish program for world domination in this 1934 issue. The articleÃ¢Â€Â”titled Ã¢Â€ÂœWho is the Enemy?Ã¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Â”blamed Jews for destroying social order and claimed that Jews wanted war, while the rest of the world wanted peace. Der StÃƒÂ¼rmer , July 1934. Credits: US Holocaust Memorial Museum, courtesy of Virginius Dabney Antisemitism also includes secular (non-religious) prejudices about Jews. Negative economic, nationalist, and racial ideas and beliefs about Jews developed in Europe over the course of many centuries. These secular prejudices and hatreds resulted from JewsÃ¢Â€Â™ position as a minority in EuropeÃ¢Â€Â™s overwhelmingly Christian societies. Together, hateful religious and secular ideas and beliefs about Jewish people make up antisemitism. Economic Antisemitism Economic antisemitism is based on damaging and demeaning stereotypes that Jews are inherently greedy, stingy, or good with money. The antisemitic phrase Ã¢Â€ÂœJew downÃ¢Â€Â (meaning, Ã¢Â€Âœto bargainÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœto swindleÃ¢Â€Â) is a contemporary expression of this prejudice. Another example is falsely associating Jews with moneylending, banking, or finance, despite the fact that most Jews do not work in these professions. Economic antisemitism has historical roots in medieval and early modern Europe. For centuries, many European authorities forbade Jews to own land, engage in agriculture, or work in most crafts or trades. These restrictions were typically motivated by religious prejudices. In order to earn a living, many Jewish people often had little choice but to work in commerce, moneylending, or currency exchange. For most Jewish people, their commercial occupations were small-scale endeavors, such as peddling goods. Many Jews lived in poverty. But in a very few instances, individual Jewish families became prominent and wealthy from lending money to courts or kingdoms. Such outliers gave rise to distortions and lies about Jewish wealth. These lies were built on older religious prejudices. And, in turn, they inspired secular conspiracy theories about Jews using this supposed wealth to wield power. In the 19th century, some political figures began to incorporate economic antisemitic ideas into their political theories. For example, they included these ideas in left- and right-wing critiques of capitalism. Antisemitic political theorists blamed Jews for entire economic systems, such as capitalism and socialism. This practice continues into the 21st century, even though most capitalists, industrialists, and extremely wealthy people are not Jewish. Nationalist Antisemitism Nationalist antisemitism is based on damaging and demeaning stereotypes that Jews are suspicious Ã¢Â€ÂœalienÃ¢Â€Â outsiders or disloyal or unpatriotic citizens. Nationalist antisemitism also claims that Jews have dangerous and suspicious international connections. Nationalist antisemites commonly use the words Ã¢Â€ÂœcosmopolitanÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€ÂœglobalistÃ¢Â€Â as coded terms for Jewish people. Nationalist animosity towards and exclusion of Jews dates back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This is when nationalism became a powerful idea in Europe. Many nationalist intellectuals and writers defined the nation through shared history, language, religion, and culture. They often questioned whether Jews could be members of the nation. Drawing on these new ideas and older prejudices, many nationalists labeled Jewish people as Ã¢Â€Âœforeigners.Ã¢Â€Â By the late 19th century, a radical form of nationalism called ethno-nationalism became popular. Ethno-nationalism defined membership in the nation based on heredity and ethnicity. Many ethno-nationalist groups were explicitly and vocally antisemitic. They did not believe that Jews could ever become members of the nation. Ethno-nationalist political movements called for the official exclusion of Jews from economic, social, and political life. Some even advocated for the forced emigration of Jews. The growth of ethno-nationalist antisemitic political movements and associations continued into the 20th and 21st centuries . The most notable of these was the Nazi Party . Racial Antisemitism Racial antisemitism is based on the discriminatory and false idea that Jews are a biologically separate, inferior, or even parasitic race. It was a key component of Nazi ideology. Racial antisemitism remains a significant element of antisemitism today. People from a variety of backgrounds and with a variety of political beliefs make false claims about the supposed racial identity of Jews. Racial antisemitism dates to the late 19th century. This is when scientific theories of race, eugenics , and Social Darwinism became popular in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere. Antisemites used these theories to give their anti-Jewish hatreds the veneer of scientific credibility. Research on DNA and the human genome proves that these ideas were incorrect. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of distinct biological races of any kind.

Credits: US Holocaust Memorial Museum Antisemitic Scapegoating and Conspiracy Theories Antisemites often use scapegoating and conspiracy theories to portray Jewish people as dangerous to society or the world. Such demonization of Jews began with early Christianity. Antisemitic scapegoating and conspiracy theories are often also based on longstanding economic, nationalist, and racist ideas about Jews. Throughout history, antisemites have often wrongly blamed Jews for many broader problems in society. They use Jews or the Jewish people as scapegoats. Contrary to facts and reason, antisemites have falsely blamed Jews for: starting plagues and epidemics, such as the Black Death (bubonic plague); causing military losses, such as GermanyÃ¢Â€Â™s defeat in World War I ; spreading Communism and other radical political movements; orchestrating European imperialism, colonialism, and the slave trade; and causing financial crises, such as the Great Depression . None of these accusations are true. Antisemitic conspiracy theorists seek to explain major world events as the results of secret plots carried out by a shadowy group of Jews. They portray Jews as sinister Ã¢Â€Âœ puppet masters .Ã¢Â€Â The most infamous antisemitic conspiracy theory arose around 1900 in an antisemitic publication called The Protocols of the Elders of Zion . Other such conspiracy theories include fabricated accusations that a cabal of Jewish people secretly control the media, Hollywood, or even the world. Antisemitic scapegoating and conspiracy theories resurface and transform in times of major social, economic, and political upheaval or uncertainty. Antisemitic political groups, such as the Nazis, frequently drew on, adapted, and spread these lies to win followers. Antisemitism in Practice For centuries, antisemitism has shaped how non-Jewish societies and individuals treat Jewish people. Governments, religious authorities, private clubs, schools, universities, and businesses have adopted laws, practices, or policies discriminating against Jews and restricting Jewish life. Individuals have targeted Jews with vile slurs, cruel caricatures, and interpersonal violence. Official Antisemitic Policies and Restrictions Since ancient times, a variety of authorities in Europe and beyond have imposed restrictions on Jewish people. These restrictions were enforced by laws, decrees, and official policies of religious or government institutions. The most common ways religious or secular authorities and governments have targeted Jews have included: expelling Jewish people from territories (for example, from England in 1290; France in 1394; and Spain in 1492); visibly marking Jews using hats, badges, or symbols, including the Star of David; prohibiting Jews from owning land; levying additional taxes on Jewish people and communities; passing laws severely limiting job or educational opportunities for Jews, such as the numerus clausus law in Hungary in 1920; forcing Jewish people to convert to Christianity or Islam under the threat of death; refusing to allow Jews to serve in the military or government service; and ordering limits on where Jews can live (for example, ghettos or the Pale of Settlement created by the Russian Empire). Societal Discrimination against Jews For centuries, many institutions, associations, or businesses voluntarily discriminated against Jews. This type of discrimination reflected the systemic nature of antisemitism in many societies. Common forms of societal discrimination against Jews have included: banning Jews from membership in private clubs or professional associations (for example, guilds, 19th century German student fraternities, or 20th century American country clubs); refusing to allow Jews to buy property in certain areas; banning Jewish students from attending a university or limiting the number of Jewish students based on a quota system; refusing to hire Jewish employees; boycotting Jewish-owned businesses, such as the far-right boycott in Poland in the late 1930s; or spreading antisemitic lies and conspiracy theories in the press and media. Interpersonal Expressions of Antisemitism For centuries, antisemitic stereotypes and prejudices have shaped interactions between Jews and non-Jews. Antisemitic individuals or groups have targeted Jews by: using slurs or telling jokes based on antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories; caricaturing or describing Jewish people as having hooked noses or other disfigured features; depicting Jews as sexual predators or carriers of disease; dehumanizing Jews in art or other images by depicting them as pigs, vermin, octopuses , or other animals; labeling people or ideas as Jewish in order to make them a target for abuse; vandalizing , burning, or otherwise desecrating synagogues, cemeteries, schools, or other Jewish religious or communal spaces; and beating, attacking, or even murdering individuals based on their perceived Jewishness. While antisemitic policies and restrictions are less common today, expressions of anti-Jewish prejudices still occur on streets, in political discourse, in churches, mosques, campuses and classrooms, in the press, and on social media and the radio. Film Nazi anti-Jewish boycott (Film) Soon after the Nazis assumed power in Germany, they launched a campaign to deprive Jews of their place in society. The effort began with an organized boycott of Jewish-owned businesses. Gangs arrested Jews, painted ""Jews forbidden"" onto shop windows, chanted antisemitic slogans, and blocked store entrances. Credits: National Archives - Film Mass Violence Targeting Jews Antisemitism has often culminated in mass violence targeting Jewish people. Antisemitic scapegoating and conspiracy theories have frequently motivated antisemites to target Jewish people with violence. The fact that Jewish people were a minority in Europe left them vulnerable to vicious attacks. Some of the most notorious examples of mass violence targeting Jewish people before the Holocaust include: massacres of entire Jewish communities by Christian soldiers during the Crusades in the Middle Ages; torture and execution of Jews by Catholic Spanish officials during the Spanish Inquisition (1478Ã¢Â€Â“1834); riots targeting Jewish communities perpetrated across Europe by local mobs in response to accusations of blood libel, typically linked to the Christian Easter and Jewish Passover holidays; and pogroms (often deadly anti-Jewish riots) perpetrated by soldiers, police, and local mobs in eastern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The scale of antisemitic mass violence and murder during the Holocaust (1933Ã¢Â€Â“1945) was in a category of its own. The Nazis and their allies and collaborators murdered six million Jews in this systematic, state-sponsored genocide. The Nazis incited people to commit genocide by drawing on centuries of antisemitic prejudices and hatreds. But the Holocaust did not mark the end of antisemitic mass violence. Antisemitic violence remains a threat to Jewish people and organizations throughout the world. Holocaust Distortion and Denial as Forms of Antisemitism Holocaust denial and distortion are newer forms of antisemitism. Holocaust denial is any attempt to negate the established facts of the Nazi German genocide of European Jews. Holocaust distortion is any statement that misrepresents established facts about the Holocaust. Holocaust denial and distortion exploit and update older antisemitic stereotypes. People who spread these irrational theories claim that the Holocaust was invented or exaggerated by Jews in order to advance their own interests. In the late 20th and 21st centuries, some antisemites misuse or exploit the documented history of the Holocaust by: using Nazi symbols (especially the swastika) to intimidate or terrorize Jewish people; threatening Jewish people with references to gas chambers or ovens; drawing analogies between the State of Israel and Nazi Germany; and making comparisons that distort, downplay, or trivialize the documented crimes committed during Holocaust. A Multifaceted and Enduring Hatred Antisemitism is a set of hateful beliefs and ideas with deep historical, social, and cultural roots. Today, antisemitic ideas and stereotypes are held by people from many different religious, ethnic, and social backgrounds and from across the political spectrum , including both the left and the right. They deploy hateful antisemitic tropes, stereotypes, and conspiracy theories to further their ideological agendas. In doing so, they demonize and dehumanize Jews. Antisemitism often starts as rhetoricÃ¢Â€Â”with slurs, scapegoating, or insults. But history has demonstrated that antisemitism can escalate to broader discrimination, dehumanization, mass violence, and genocide. Footnotes Footnote reference 1. This is called Ã¢Â€ÂœsupersessionismÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœreplacement theology.Ã¢Â€Â Footnote reference 2. For centuries, many Christians believed that Jews committed deicide by killing Jesus. In fact, Jesus was killed by Roman authorities. The leaders of various Christian traditions reinforced this false belief in their official teachings. It was not until the late 20th century that some Christian churches condemned the charge of deicide as false. For example, the Roman Catholic Church repudiated these lies as part of the Second Vatican Council in 1965. Footnote reference 3. Many Christian anti-Jewish stereotypes can be traced back to the first century figure of Judas Iscariot, who, like Jesus, was Jewish. In Christian scripture, Judas betrays Jesus in exchange for 30 pieces of silver. In Christian-dominated Europe, this portrayal transformed into a hateful stereotype of Jews, as symbolized by Judas, as treacherous and greedy. Footnote reference 4. In the late Middle Ages and early modern period, many Christians accused Jews of working with or even being the devil. These assertions became an accepted part of Christian treatises, theology, morality plays, folk tales, and art. Notably, Martin Luther, the theologian who initiated the Protestant Reformation in 1517, wrote an offensive treatise about Jews in 1543. Enraged that Jews did not convert to Christianity in the wake of the Reformation, he hostilely labeled Jews as descendants of the devil. Christian artists often depicted Jews as the devil or as animal-like figures with horns, claws, jagged teeth, and/or cloven feet.

However, this figure does not show up in the survey itself and is not considered an accurate one. In any case, it should be noted that the vast majority of violent crime is intraracial (committed by a person of one race against a person of the same race), not interracial, in nature.

White supremacists typically employ references to 13 (by itself), 13/50, 13/52 or 13/90 in response to social media posts, and in the comments sections of news stories about crimes in which the suspected perpetrator is African American. In some instances, white supremacists use the numbers as a purported police radio code, using language like, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe have a 1390 in progress.Ã¢Â€Â",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.5}",HIGH

Antisemitism in K-12 schools has become a pressing national concern, with 1,162 antisemitic incidents recorded in 2023 and 860 antisemitic incidents recorded in 2024 in K-12 schools alone, according to recent data from ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. Since 2020, incidents at K-12 schools have spiked by an alarming 434%. In light of the persistently high rates of antisemitic incidents in K-12 schools, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Ratings and Assessments Institute (RAI) and Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) launched a new initiative to examine antisemitism within non-Jewish independent/private K-12 schools, henceforth referred to as independent K-12 schools. Independent K-12 schools were selected as the subject of the research as they operate outside of the direct oversight of public education systems, meaning they typically have greater autonomy in shaping their curricula, policies, and disciplinary procedures, which can lead to inconsistent responses to antisemitism. By examining this specific sector, we aim to highlight unique challenges and identify gaps in accountability, reporting and education that may not be as visible in public schools.

To kick off this initiative, RAI and CCAE conducted focus groups and a survey of parents of Jewish children who attend independent K-12 schools. We recruited participants through ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s established networks, including its 25 regional offices, which maintain connections with Jewish stakeholders and community leaders throughout the country. This study aimed to assess the independent school climate for Jewish students amidst heightened tensions due to the Israel-Hamas conflict and identify methods to better support Jewish students and their families in these settings. The findings, detailed in this report, highlight the urgent need to protect Jewish students in independent K-12 schools and foster an inclusive and safe educational environment for all.","[1, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Some even called for additional violence and praised the murder suspect as a hero of the anti-Zionist movement.Ã‚Â 

Some prominent groups in the movement did condemn the murders, however, their responses were then met with criticism or mockery from other anti-Zionists. Reactions from various other extremists and conspiracy theorists have also included antisemitic accusations and immediate claims of a Ã¢Â€Âœfalse flagÃ¢Â€Â operation.Ã‚Â 

The suspect, 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, Illinois, was taken into custody the night of May 21, 2025,Ã‚Â  shouting, Ã¢Â€ÂœFree, free Palestine,Ã¢Â€Â after fatally shooting Israeli embassy staffers Yaron Lischinsky (an Israeli citizen) and Sarah Milgrim (a U.S. citizen), as they were exiting an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC). Rodriguez told police who arrived at the scene, Ã¢Â€ÂœI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza.Ã¢Â€Â

Praise for Rodriguez and Calls for Further Action

RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s words and actions have been cheered by various anti-Zionist groups and influencers, as has a manifesto posted to his X account that the ADL Center on Extremism has, with a high degree of certainty, linked to him.

The manifesto, titled Ã¢Â€ÂœEscalate For Gaza, Bring The War HomeÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” slogans commonly used by anti-Israel activists, particularly in more extreme, militant spaces Ã¢Â€Â” was turned into a printable, distributable zine by multiple anti-Zionist groups. One such example was created and shared by Unity of Fields, a far-left anti-Zionist Ã¢Â€Âœdirect action networkÃ¢Â€Â that supports the targeting of Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistÃ¢Â€Â individuals and institutions, which reproduced RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s words in a zine that also included prominent imagery of a gun.

In a series of posts, Unity of Fields commented, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe ainÃ¢Â€Â™t condemning shit,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœFREE ELIAS RODRIGUEZ!Ã¢Â€Â and referred to the suspect as a Ã¢Â€Âœpolitical prisoner.Ã¢Â€Â The groupÃ¢Â€Â¯doubled down in yet another post on X Friday, claiming that Rodriguez was acting out of Ã¢Â€Âœsolidarity and love for the Palestinian people.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Resistance News Network (RNN) andÃ‚Â Palestine News Network (PNN), extreme anti-Zionist groups that also post content praising anti-Israel terror and violence, also expressed support for the shooting. In the popular RNN Telegram channel, hundreds of people reacted with celebratory emojis to the post announcing the attack.

PNN leader David Wolff posted a screenshot on Instagram of a news story about the shooting that featured a photograph of Lischinsky and added the caption, Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath to Nazis.Ã¢Â€Â

Additional Justification for the Shooting

Even others who did not outright celebrate the murders nonetheless found ways to justify or excuse them, including frequently utilizing Nazi-related commentary.

Eyup Lovely, an X account with some 65,000 followers, posted mockingly: Ã¢Â€ÂœMy heart breaks for the two innocent staffers of the German Reich embassy who were robbed of their lives by senseless anti Germanic violence last night. I have telegraphed my sympathies to the FÃƒÂ¼hrer for the Volksgenossen community.Ã¢Â€Â

Aidan Simardone, a Canadian lawyer and writer, garnered more than five thousand likes on a post on X mocking Ã¢Â€ÂœEvery Ã¢Â€Â˜progressiveÃ¢Â€Â™ politician: I oppose the Holocaust, but oppose the killing of Nazi Germany embassy staff.Ã¢Â€Â

Palestinian activist Mohammed El-Kurd, who writes for The Nation and Mondoweiss, shared a post that compared the murders of the two Israeli Embassy staffers to the 1938 killing of a Nazi diplomat at the hands of a Jewish refugee in Paris. El-Kurd also denied that the shooting was Ã¢Â€Âœa random antisemitic attackÃ¢Â€Â and alleged Ã¢Â€Âœit was undeniably, and by the alleged shooterÃ¢Â€Â™s own admission, a response to the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza.Ã¢Â€Â

The line of argument that the attack was not antisemitic Ã¢Â€Â” even as the suspect targeted a Jewish event at a Jewish institution with a significant number of Jewish attendees Ã¢Â€Â” also resonated with Candace Owens, the right-wing public figure and political commentator who has come to embrace and promote antisemitic tropes and extreme anti-Israel rhetoric.

In her show on Thursday, posted to over 4.5 million subscribers, Owens referred to the characterization of the shooting as an antisemitic attack as Ã¢Â€Âœdesperate,Ã¢Â€Â and said the Ã¢Â€ÂœZionists have lost the moral argument...Too many Americans are awakened to this, especially the youth are awakened to these sorts of tactics. And they just did too much too fast, trying to cancel too many people, trying to call everybody literally Hitler.Ã¢Â€Â

Khaled Barakat, who is sanctioned by the U.S. government for his ties to the terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and is a leader of the transnational anti-Israel groups Samidoun and Masar Badil, stated that Ã¢Â€Âœtargeting employees of the Ã¢Â€Â˜IsraeliÃ¢Â€Â™ embassy, is a natural consequence of the Zionist entityÃ¢Â€Â™s crimes in the Gaza Strip.Ã¢Â€Â

Charlotte Kates, BarakatÃ¢Â€Â™s partner and Samidoun's international coordinator, similarly commented: Ã¢Â€ÂœIt should surprise...no one at all that people will act when there is no accountability whatsoever imposed upon that genocidal regime...Genocide has to have consequences.Ã¢Â€Â

Haz Al-Din, one of the founding members of the American Communist Party (ACP), whose openly pro-terror activities include attending former Hezbollah leader Hassan NasrallahÃ¢Â€Â™s funeral in Lebanon earlier this year, commented, Ã¢Â€ÂœI DO NOT support or encourage violence. However, Zionists have NO moral leg to stand on.Ã¢Â€Â

The International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network (IJAN), a group that facilitates global anti-Israel activity on the part of anti-Zionist Jews, posted on Instagram to its close to 70,000 followers that the shooting was just ""consequences"" for Israel's actions and ""a response to the genocide in Gaza."" It further said that the ""attack is precedented and the precedent was set by Israel.""

Ã‚Â 

Criticism Toward Those Condemning the Murders

Various anti-Zionist activists also reacted by mocking those within the anti-Israel movement who condemned the shooting. TheÃ‚Â Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), for example, put out a statement attempting to distance itself from Rodriguez Ã¢Â€Â” who was affiliated with the group for a time in 2017 and 2018 Ã¢Â€Â” and saying that they Ã¢Â€Âœdo not supportÃ¢Â€Â the shooting. Joe Catron, a longtime anti-Israel activist who has been involved with Samidoun and theÃ‚Â International Solidarity Movement (ISM), responded to PSLÃ¢Â€Â™s post by asking, Ã¢Â€ÂœSo were all those Ã¢Â€Â˜resistance is justified!Ã¢Â€Â™ chants you led outright lies?Ã¢Â€Â in reference to theÃ‚Â slogan frequently used by PSL at their anti-Israel protests.

Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) was also among the anti-Israel groups to condemn the shooting, posting from its national account: Ã¢Â€ÂœAll human life is precious, which is precisely why we are struggling for a world in which all people can live in safety and dignity.Ã¢Â€Â The United Liberation Front for Palestine commented in response: Ã¢Â€ÂœAnd anyone who condemns [the shooting] will be telling on themselves.Ã¢Â€Â

Lamis Deek, a New York-based anti-Zionist leader with the groupÃ‚Â Al-Awda, responded by equating JVPÃ¢Â€Â™s statement to excusing Nazis: Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â˜American born Himler converted to Nazism to defend Nazis from accusations of forced famine and secure money and weapons for Nazi Germany, shot by activist who yelled Ã¢Â€Â˜Free the Jews.Ã¢Â€Â™ JVP and US establishment condemn anti-German violence, send condolences to global Nazi family.Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â

Zainab Chaudry, director of the Maryland chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), put out a statement standing against Ã¢Â€Âœall forms of violence, including political violence,Ã¢Â€Â adding that while the organization shares Ã¢Â€Âœthe immense pain and anguish over Israel's ongoing U.S backed genocide and famine in Gaza. It is not the answer. We stand against tactics that undermine the just and righteous cause for a free Palestine.Ã¢Â€Â

CAIR Chicago director Ahmed Rehab also condemned the shooting, but couched it by stating, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe stand squarely against vigilante violence Ã¢Â€Â” even against those who may be complicit in genocide.Ã¢Â€Â","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/extremists-and-conspiracy-theorists-deny-capital-jewish-museum-shooting-false,"In the wake of the murder of two Israeli embassy staff members at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., conspiracy theories about the shooting quickly circulated on social media from users across the political spectrum. The most prevalent of these conspiratorial posts alleged that the shooting was a purposeful and coordinated Ã¢Â€Âœfalse flagÃ¢Â€Â attack carried out by the Israeli or U.S. government to make Jews and Israel look sympathetic, tighten relations between the two countries or rationalize going to war with Iran. Others claimed that the shooting was intended to justify measures cracking down on free speech and dissent regarding the Israel-Hamas war. These conspiracy theories follow a disturbing yet predictable narrative among antisemites and extreme anti-Zionists, particularly since the October 7, 2023 Hamas terror attacks in Israel: the belief that Jews, Zionists and Israelis are to blame for the violence and harassment targeting them, and that demonizing them is more important than the truth.

Blaming Israel
Some anti-Zionist and antisemitic influencers alleged that Israel, Mossad or the Israel Defense Forces orchestrated the shooting, though they had different reasons why. In some far-right extremist spaces, some claimed that the attack was intended to make Jews and Israel more sympathetic. As one user wrote, the attack makes them Ã¢Â€Âœthe victims againÃ¢Â€Â just as countries were Ã¢Â€Âœcooling on IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s endless genocide in gaza [sic].Ã¢Â€Â Another wrote, Ã¢Â€ÂœJews pulling off psyop, false flag shootings as they destroy the world, genocide entire peoples. A man did something to someone near the Ã¢Â€Â˜DC Jewish museumÃ¢Â€Â™ dedicated to the Ã¢Â€Â˜HolocaustÃ¢Â€Â™ fairytale. Let us mourn for their psyop.Ã¢Â€Â

Similarly, some suggested that the attack was carried out to strengthen U.S.-Israeli relations in response to perceived friction between the two countries. Others suggested the shooting was a Mossad operation or coordinated by Zionists to distract the world from the Israel-Hamas war.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Still others asserted that Israel would use the attack to justify going to war with Iran. For example, Gateway Pundit journalist Elijah Schaffer wrote in an X post with over 419,000 views and 15,000 likes that Ã¢Â€ÂœIsrael would kill their ownÃ¢Â€Â for this very purpose. Schaffer also drew from older conspiracy theories to back up his claim, alleging that Israel helped coordinate the attacks on October 7, 2023, and that 9/11 was an inside job to justify going to war.Ã‚Â 

AdameMedia Ã¢Â€Â” a popular conspiratorial X account with over 323K followers Ã¢Â€Â” argued in a post with over 55,000 views and 4,600 likes that the Ã¢Â€Â˜false flagÃ¢Â€Â™ theory was the most plausible explanation, stating Ã¢Â€ÂœThe quality of Israeli false flag [sic] has fallen drastically since 9/11.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Blaming the U.S. GovernmentÃ‚Â 
As is common in the wake of highly salient events, some conspiracy theorists online claimed that the attack was not the work of a single shooter, but instead a product of a U.S. government conspiracy. On X, far-right influencer Jackson Hinkle claimed in a post with more than 111,000 views and 4,000 likes that the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) Ã¢Â€Â” an anti-Zionist organization that the alleged gunman was previously affiliated with Ã¢Â€Â” is working with U.S. federal agents, declaring the Ã¢Â€ÂœassassinationÃ¢Â€Â was Ã¢Â€Âœa false flag.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

Others went even further to declare that the U.S. government was operating on behalf of Mossad. One X user wrote that the Ã¢Â€ÂœFBI is a mossad [sic] extension.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Users affiliated with the antisemitic X broadcast network JQ Radio suggested the shooting was partially coordinated by the CIA, positing that the suspect Ã¢Â€Âœwas connected to an intelligence agencyÃ¢Â€Â and may have been Ã¢Â€ÂœtrainedÃ¢Â€Â by the FBI to carry out the shooting.

Attack on Free SpeechÃ‚Â 
Shortly after news broke of the shooting, there were baseless claims that the attack would be used to erode free speech in the United States. As white supremacist streamer and influencer Nick Fuentes wrote on X in a post with 1.8 million views and 39,000 likes, Ã¢Â€ÂœFalse flag, right on schedule,Ã¢Â€Â asserting that the demise of Ã¢Â€Âœfree speech and diplomacyÃ¢Â€Â was imminent. Several other antisemitic and anti-Zionist figures agreed that the attack was designed to target free speech and to silence promoters of anti-Israel rhetoric. On Instagram, X and Bluesky, anti-Zionist influencer and MintPress journalist Greg Stoker shied away from calling it a false flag, but claimed the shooting would result in the loss of Ã¢Â€Âœfree speech and dissentÃ¢Â€Â either way.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.0, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

Particularly in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, we have seen the exponential rise in antisemitic actions and threats along with a continual drumbeat of rhetoric that incites and justifies this hate.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

This heinous attack is yet another wake-up call that governments, law enforcement and societies worldwide need to take language and threats directed against the Jewish community seriously and ensure our communities have the security they need.Ã‚Â  In the past decade, Jews have been killed in their synagogues, kosher grocery stores, and their homes. Antisemitic attitudes, stereotypes, and conspiracy theories have become more normalized. They are a threat not only to Jewish communities but also to the freedoms and rights of all people.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli-German and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, an American from Kansas, who were staffers at the Israeli Embassy in Washington.Ã‚Â  May their memories be a blessing.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

As he was taken into custody, Rodriguez shouted, Ã¢Â€ÂœFree, free Palestine.""

An online manifesto posted on X lays out the reasons for the attack. The ADL Center on Extremism has been able to connect the alleged suspect, with a high degree of certainty, to the X account and the manifesto, shared under the heading Ã¢Â€ÂœEscalate For Gaza, Bring The War HomeÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” slogans commonly used by anti-Israel activists, particularly in more extreme, militant spaces.

Extreme Anti-Israel Beliefs

The text of RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s alleged manifesto reflected an apparent trajectory of radicalization as the author stated that non-violent protests against IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s actions in Gaza have been insufficient and that the Ã¢Â€Âœperpetrators and abettorsÃ¢Â€Â of genocide have Ã¢Â€Âœforfeited their humanity.Ã¢Â€Â The author noted that Ã¢Â€Âœnonviolent protest in the opening weeks of the genocide seemed to signal some sort of turning pointÃ¢Â€Â¦But thus far the rhetoric has not amounted to much.Ã¢Â€Â It then went on to praise Aaron Bushnell, the 25-year-old active-duty United States Airman who died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., on February 25, 2024.Ã‚Â 

The manifesto concluded with a section about Ã¢Â€Âœthe morality of armed demonstration,Ã¢Â€Â in which the author commented that Ã¢Â€Âœthe action would have been morally justified taken 11 years ago during Protective Edge [IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s name for its military operation in the 2014 Gaza war], around the time I personally became acutely aware of our brutal conduct in Palestine,Ã¢Â€Â but acknowledged that such an action would have seemed Ã¢Â€ÂœillegibleÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€ÂœinsaneÃ¢Â€Â to Ã¢Â€Âœmost AmericansÃ¢Â€Â at the time. He concluded that now, in 2025, armed action seems like Ã¢Â€Âœthe only sane thing to do.Ã¢Â€Â The author signed off with: ""Free Palestine, Elias Rodriguez.""Ã‚Â 

Additional posts made by the X account over the past 20 months echo similarly extreme anti-Israel sentiments, such as language in one post declaring Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath To IsraelÃ¢Â€Â and in another calling a Jewish individual a Ã¢Â€Âœzionazi [sic].Ã¢Â€Â The account also shared openly pro-terror content, including reposting videos of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah; commenting, Ã¢Â€ÂœGod bless them,Ã¢Â€Â on a post about Houthi missiles launched toward Tel Aviv; and reposting a tweet after the 2024 U.S. presidential election that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœDonÃ¢Â€Â™t Blame Me, I Voted For Hamas.Ã¢Â€Â

Background on Rodriguez

Based on posts shared on RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s alleged X account, he appears to have participated in anti-Israel protests in Chicago following HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. In one such post, the X account shared footage from a large protest held in the city on October 21, 2023.

Research by the ADL Center on Extremism shows that Rodriguez was previously affiliated with two prominent anti-Israel organizations, ANSWER Coalition and the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), and participated in multiple ANSWER and PSL protests in Chicago from late 2017 through early 2018.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

Rodriguez spoke at an October 2017 protest organized by ANSWER, the PeopleÃ¢Â€Â™s Congress of Resistance and Black Lives Matter Women of Faith, demanding justice for Laquan McDonald, who was shot and killed by police in Chicago in 2014.Ã¢Â€Â¯In an article published about the protest on the PSL website Ã¢Â€ÂœLiberation News,Ã¢Â€Â Rodriquez was described as being affiliated with PSL and photographs show Rodriquez holding an ANSWER sign.Ã‚Â 

Rodriguez also participated in a series of ANSWER protests against the city of ChicagoÃ¢Â€Â™s bid to become the site of a new Amazon headquarters. In local news media coverage of a January 2018 protest on this issue, he was identified as a member of ANSWER.

Reactions

In the hours after the D.C. shooting on Wednesday, PSL attempted to distance itself from Rodriguez, posting from its national account: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe reject any attempt to associate the PSL with the DC shooting. Elias Rodriguez is not a member of the PSL. He had a brief association with one branch of the PSL that ended in 2017. We know of no contact with him in over 7 years. We have nothing to do with this shooting and do not support it.Ã¢Â€Â

Anti-Israel activists quickly responded to the shooting, with many celebrating the violence and attempting to justify it. Masar Badil, a transnational anti-Israel organization connected to the terror-affiliated group Samidoun, wrote that the shooting Ã¢Â€Âœtargeting employees of the Ã¢Â€Â˜IsraeliÃ¢Â€Â™ embassy, is a natural consequence of the Zionist entityÃ¢Â€Â™s crimes in the Gaza Strip.Ã¢Â€Â Charlotte Kates, international coordinator of Samidoun, responded: Ã¢Â€ÂœIt should surprise...no one at all that people will act when there is no accountability whatsoever imposed upon that genocidal regime...Genocide has to have consequences.Ã¢Â€Â

Unity of Fields (formerly Palestine Action U.S.), a far-left anti-Zionist Ã¢Â€Âœdirect action networkÃ¢Â€Â that supports the targeting of Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistÃ¢Â€Â individuals and institutions, retweeted KatesÃ¢Â€Â™s response and additionally commented: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe ainÃ¢Â€Â™t condemning shitÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœFREE ELIAS RODRIGUEZ!Ã¢Â€Â

The group also published a zine of RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s alleged manifesto Ã¢Â€Â” emphasizing his use of the Ã¢Â€ÂœEscalate For Gaza, Bring The War HomeÃ¢Â€Â language, alongside an image of a gun Ã¢Â€Â” and referred to him as a Ã¢Â€Âœpolitical prisoner,Ã¢Â€Â as federal authorities investigate the attack.

Ã‚Â 

The Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a radical New York-based anti-Israel group, wrote on X: Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat Elias Rodriguez did is the highest expression of anti-Zionism.Ã¢Â€Â In a similar post to its Telegram channel, the group added: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe need more Elias Rodriguez in the world.Ã¢Â€Â

Resistance News Network (RNN) and Palestine News Network (PNN), extreme anti-Zionist groups that also post content praising anti-Israel terror and violence, also expressed support for the shooting. In the popular RNN Telegram channel, hundreds of people reacted with celebratory emojis to the post announcing the attack.

Unsurprisingly, far-right extremist spaces have also responded to the shooting by celebrating the deaths of the victims. Some cheered their perceived enemies fighting each other: as one white supremacist wrote, Ã¢Â€ÂœRejoice when your enemies kill each other.Ã¢Â€Â When the shooterÃ¢Â€Â™s identity was announced, some far-right extremists took the opportunity to further spread anti-immigrant sentiments, despite no evidence that the shooter was an immigrant, while others joked about their identity. One white supremacist wrote regarding the shooter, Ã¢Â€ÂœDoing the job Americans wonÃ¢Â€Â™t yadda yadda yadda.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Various social media users, including some prominent antisemitic and anti-Israel influencers, reacted to the shooting by quickly spreading unfounded conspiracy theories, including alleging that the shooting was a false flag operation. Some also claimed that this attack would be used to make Israel and Jews the ""victim"" again.Ã‚Â 

Broader Context

This latest attack comes amid an unprecedentedly high threat environment for Jewish communities in the U.S. and across the world. Jewish institutions, including synagogues, community centers and museums, have been the targets of 1,702 antisemitic incidents in 2024, according to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents in the U.S. Of those incidents, 631 were related to Israel, including 86 which occurred at anti-Israel rallies in the vicinity of those institutions.

This is the eighth terrorist plot or attack targeting Jews, Zionists, or Jewish institutions since July 2024:

April 13, 2025. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:Ã‚Â Cody Balmer allegedlyÃ‚Â broke into Pennsylvania Gov. Josh ShapiroÃ¢Â€Â™s residence in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, set multiple fires, then called 911 and referred to Shapiro as aÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœmonsterÃ¢Â€Â and blamed him for Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Hamas war.Ã‚Â 

December 28Ã‚Â , 2024. Gainesville, Florida:Ã‚Â The FBI arrestedÃ‚Â Forrest Pemberton of Gainesville, Florida, and subsequently charged him in a plot to travel to the south Florida offices of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel advocacy group, with the intent of harming people there, possibly in a suicide attack.

December 17, 2024. Fairfax, Virginia: FBI agents arrested an Egyptian citizen and George Mason University student,Ã‚Â Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan, and charged him in a plot to perpetrate a mass casualty attack at Israeli consulate in New York City.

October 26, 2024, Chicago, Illinois:Ã‚Â Sidi Mohamed Abdallahi shot a Jewish man walking to his synagogue and then opened fire on responding police and paramedics.Ã‚Â  Local authorities later filed felony hate crime and terrorism charges against Abdallahi, saying that evidence from his phone indicated that the suspect planned the shooting and intentionally sought to target Jews. Abdallah wasÃ‚Â found dead of apparent suicide in his jail cell in November 2024.

September 4, 2024, New York, New York: As part of a two-country investigation, Canadian authorities arrested a Pakistani citizen,Ã‚Â Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, while trying to cross the border into the United States, allegedly as part of a planned mass shooting against a Jewish target in New York to support ISIS.

August 14, 2024, Orlando, Florida: Hashem Younis Hashem Hnaihen, a Jordanian citizen, wasÃ‚Â arrested in August 2024,Ã‚Â  on suspicion that he sought to target businesses that he believed were supportive of Israel. Hnaihen pled guilty on December 20, 2024, to four counts of threatening to use explosives and one count of destruction of an energy facility.

July 16, 2024, New York, New York: In an international terrorist incident, federal authorities charged Michael Chkhikvishvili, a citizen of the nation of Georgia, with soliciting hate crimes and mass violence.Ã‚Â  According to authorities, Chkhikvishvili attempted to recruit others, including an undercover law enforcement officer, to commit a mass casualty attack in New York City. He also allegedly encouraged bombings, arson and poisonings against Jews, racial minorities and homeless people.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

New York, NY, May 22, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today issued the following statement in response to last nightÃ¢Â€Â™s heinous attack against two individuals attending an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. hosted by the American Jewish Committee. The suspect in the killings of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, both employees at the Israeli Embassy, is reported to have shouted Ã¢Â€ÂœFree, Free PalestineÃ¢Â€Â as he was being taken into custody.

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

Our hearts are broken for the victims of this heinous attack against a young couple attending an American Jewish Committee (AJC) event in Washington D.C. This was not just against the Jewish community of D.C., but an assault on all Jewish Americans and indeed all Americans.

We know that words have consequences. When antisemitic rhetoric is normalized, tolerated, or even amplified in our public discourse, it creates an environment where violence against Jews becomes more likely. In a climate of relentless antisemitism in the U.S. and globally since Oct. 7, 2023, unfortunately, this tragedy was inevitable. Already it has led to Jewish students on campus being attacked in libraries and on the quad, Jews walking to synagogue attacked, and Jewish businesses and synagogues targeted.

And now, we have this tragic murder of two innocent young people in the prime of their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and the entire Jewish community at this difficult time.

It's time for all Americans to come together to say that antisemitism has no place in our country, and for all of our leaders to work together to root out this evil and hate.

Antisemitism was already at historic levels. ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s latest Audit of Antisemitic Incidents tracked a total of 9,354 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in 2024, an increase of 5 percent from the previous year and a 344 percent increase over the past five years. This is the highest number of attacks against Jews on record since ADL began tracking incidents 46 years ago.

According to data from the ADL Center on Extremism, since July 2024 there have been nine terrorist plots and attacks targeting Jews, Zionists or Jewish Institutions in the United States.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/independent-k-12-schools-failing-respond-antisemitism,"New York, NY, May 21, 2025, Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã‚Â Jewish families at independent K-12 schools are facing many challenges related to antisemitism and ongoing institutional shortcomings in addressing these issues, according to new research from the ADL Ratings and Assessments Institute (RAI) and the Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE). To address the failures of many independent K-12 schools to address antisemitism, ADL is launching a new initiative to support and empower parents and to hold independent schools accountable.

This initiative will expand access to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s growing suite of parent advocacy resources, ensuring parents have the information they need to urge their schools to take action and adopt best practices. ADL is also expanding its partnership with Jewish Leaders in Schools (JLIS), a no-cost, ADL-supported network that turns parents into powerful advocates. With expert one-on-one guidance and a proven framework, JLIS equips parents to fight antisemitism and partner effectively with schools to create lasting, positive change. Finally, ADL will offer free legal support through ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s K-12 Antisemitism Legal Line for Jewish families whose children have faced antisemitism.

""These independent schools are failing to support Jewish families. By tolerating -- or in some cases, propagating -- antisemitism in their classrooms, too many independent schools in cities across the country are sending a message that Jewish students are not welcome. It's wrong. It's hateful. And it must stop,"" said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœADL is partnering with parents to demand change.""

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s new report reveals the widespread problem in independent schools.Ã‚Â The research, which included a multi-state survey, as well as focus groups with parents of Jewish children in independent schools in metropolitan areas including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., found concern among parents about antisemitic symbols, as well as problematic curricula and classroom content related to Jews and Israel. Nearly one-third of surveyed parents said they identified problematic curricula since October 7, 2023, and even more parents reported that their children experienced or witnessed at least one form of antisemitism.

The prevalence of antisemitism contributes to a culture where some Jewish children feel uncomfortable expressing their identity in school. One parent told ADL researchers,Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Âœ[My child] has a Jewish star necklace. He doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t wear it at school.""

Many schools appear reluctant to address antisemitism, often downplaying parentsÃ¢Â€Â™ concerns. Parents described school leaders who lead them to believe they were alone in raising concerns about antisemitism, despite evidence to the contrary. Many Jewish families feel pushed to the margins in independent K-12 schools and some are considering leaving. One parent said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe recently pulled both our kidsÃ¢Â€Â¦ after several antisemitic incidents went unaddressed.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœSchool administrators and faculty have a duty to ensure safe, inclusive environments for all,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â said Shira Goodman, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Vice President of Advocacy who oversees both RAI and CCAE. Ã¢Â€ÂœADL will fully invest in bolstering the families who are demanding that their schools meet this obligation.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/under-radar-militias-use-new-terminology-hide-plain-sight,"Across the United States, militia groups are redefining how they identify themselves and each other, signaling a broader effort to soften their image and manipulate public perception. Research by the ADL Center on Extremism over the past year into many new militia groups shows they have eschewed the traditional Ã¢Â€ÂœmilitiaÃ¢Â€Â moniker, especially those with younger members. While many groups continue to explicitly call themselves militias, others have embraced a new nomenclature and are using names such as Ã¢Â€Âœmutual assistance groupÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœcontingency group.Ã¢Â€Â

These militia groups, like their older counterparts, still espouse an anti-government ideology with an emphasis on paramilitary training. While this rhetorical shift may seem cosmetic, the adoption of these new terms allows militia groups to camouflage their extremist ideology, sidestep public scrutiny and grow their networks both online and offline.

The Problem with Ã¢Â€ÂœMilitiaÃ¢Â€Â

Since the 1990s, groups have used the Ã¢Â€ÂœmilitiaÃ¢Â€Â moniker to signal their participation in a movement that embraces an anti-government,Ã‚Â conspiracy-oriented ideology and stresses armed paramilitary training. However, over the course of the movement's history, federal and state authorities have convicted many militia group members for a wide range ofÃ‚Â criminal activities, from amassing illegal arsenals to violent plots and attacks. The extreme acts of many of its members forever tarnished the reputation of the militia movement.

The movementÃ¢Â€Â™s negative image has also hampered the efforts of militia groups to build inroads with local communities because most community members have typically rejected them. Bob Herget, a leader of the York County Poquoson Community Mission in Virginia, has claimed that his local sheriff advised him to abandon the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s former name, Ã¢Â€ÂœYork County Poquoson Constitutional Militia,Ã¢Â€Â allegedly anticipating that the community would have a problem with the word Ã¢Â€Âœmilitia.Ã¢Â€Â Similarly, in the fall of 2024, a chapter leader of the Yellowstone MilitiaÃ¢Â€Â”a Billings, Montana-based Ã‚Â Three PercenterÃ‚Â  militia groupÃ¢Â€Â”stated to county commissioners during aÃ‚Â meeting in which they volunteered to provide community Ã¢Â€ÂœprotectionÃ¢Â€Â that they Ã¢Â€Âœare not the bad militia that people. . . ha[ve] made it out to beÃ¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  and that there is an Ã¢Â€Âœunfortunate history of the word militia.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

These emerging names havenÃ¢Â€Â™t just impacted the public perception of the movement, they have also affected their online organizing. In August 2020, FacebookÃ¢Â€Â”at the time, one of the primary organizing hubs for the militia movementÃ¢Â€Â”announced that it was removing militia groups along withÃ‚Â QAnon spaces from its platform because of their widespread violent rhetoric and celebration of violent acts that occurred during theÃ‚Â George Floyd protests taking place across the U.S. at the time. This move greatly impeded the ability of militia groups to operate online.

The adoption of new terminology allows militias toÃ‚Â evade content moderation and create new safe havens on mainstream social media to promote their anti-government ideology, grow their network and translate online activities into real-world action.Ã‚Â As a result, these militias have attracted hundredsÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â” and at times thousands Ã¢Â€Â” of followers on their accounts.

This access to mainstream social media platforms has allowed militias to gain visibility among mainstream audiences. For example, many of these militias are operating on Instagram, where theyÃ‚Â interact on posts detailing training exercises and recruitment efforts, often showcasing joint paramilitary training with other militia groups they connect with on the platform.

The Virginia-based Central Virginia Irregulars (CVI) militiaÃ¢Â€Â”which was founded in 2023 and also calls itself a Ã¢Â€Âœmutual assistance groupÃ¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Â”exemplifies this trend. In an April 2025 Instagram post, CVI tagged and urged militia groups to connect with potential recruits as they claimed to have received an influx of Ã¢Â€Âœgroup informationÃ¢Â€Â requests. The post received comments from at least 10 other militia groups.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

Their tagging efforts in the post are part of a broader strategy on the platform to gain the attention of other militia groups both regionally and nationally. This drives engagement on their account and creates a ripple effect where militia groups will endorse each other and further spread their content on mainstream platforms.

New Names

While a number of militia groups continue to call themselves Ã¢Â€ÂœmilitiaÃ¢Â€Â or use other historical names like Ã¢Â€ÂœminutemenÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœirregulars,Ã¢Â€Â many of the names of newer, emerging militia groups, such as Ã¢Â€Âœmutual assistance groups,Ã¢Â€Â areÃ‚Â adopted from theÃ‚Â prepper/survivalist community. Historically, there has been a crossover between the militia movement and the survivalist community. By adopting names tied to these communities, militia groups attempt to appear benign, blend into more mainstream currents, and attract potential recruits. New militia groups have opted for many different names, with the most popular self-descriptions including:

Mutual Assistance Group (MAG)
Reconnaissance Group
Contingency Group
Guerrilla Group
Civil Training Group
Ã¢Â€ÂœPrepared CitizenÃ¢Â€Â Group
Ã¢Â€ÂœVolunteerÃ¢Â€Â Group

These new names enable these militia groups to continue their old patterns of conducting organized paramilitary training and promote the same anti-government beliefs that have resulted in violence in the past.",[6],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH

ADL and JLens noted thatÃ‚Â Proposal 9 is expected to be submitted to a shareholder vote at the Alphabet annual meeting on June 6, 2025. The proposal cites the fact that Alphabet provides cloud-computing technology to Ã¢Â€ÂœProject Nimbus,Ã¢Â€Â a system used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and many civilian applications, as justification for a request that the Company commission an independent third-party report to determine whether its customersÃ¢Â€Â™ use of certain products and services, Ã¢Â€Âœcontributes to human rights harms in conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRA).Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe believe this proposal is closely aligned with the objectives of theÃ‚Â Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, whose goal is to delegitimize the State of Israel.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

ADL and JLens believe that Proposal 9 misrepresents Ã¢Â€ÂœProject NimbusÃ¢Â€Â by portraying it solely as a military initiative, while ignoring its broad civilian applications across IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s ministries of finance, healthcare, education, and transportation. At the same time, the proposal disregards the urgent and lawful need for modern defense technologiesÃ¢Â€Â”especially in the wake of the October 7, 2023 terror attacks, which killed over 1,200 people and took hundreds hostage. AlphabetÃ¢Â€Â™s cloud services play a vital role in both safeguarding Israeli civilians and strengthening essential public infrastructure, making this proposal not only misleading but dangerously out of touch with the realities on the ground.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœAlphabetÃ¢Â€Â™s shareholders should see this proposal for what it is: an attempt to misuse the proxy process to advance a divisive political agenda that has no place in corporate governance,Ã¢Â€Â said Ari Hoffnung, Managing Director of JLens. Ã¢Â€ÂœProposal 9 not only distorts the purpose of Project NimbusÃ¢Â€Â”it also risks undermining shareholder value by inserting geopolitics into decisions about lawful, commercially sound partnerships.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

The shareholder proposal is not the first time Alphabet has come under attack from anti-Israel activists, but rather part of a broader campaign targeting Google for its business ties with Israel. In April 2024,Ã‚Â Google terminated 28 employees following a series of protests against its cloud contract with the Israeli government, citing workplace disruptions and policy violations, according to an internal memo. BDS movement organizers also condemned the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s 2025 acquisition of Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz, claiming it reflects support for the so-called Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraeli apartheid system.Ã¢Â€Â In one extreme case, protesters targeted the home of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, hanging banners that labeled him a Ã¢Â€Âœgenocide profiteer.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

JLens has filed a Notice of Exempt Solicitation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, describing its opposition to Alphabet shareholder proposal.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/audit-antisemitic-incidents-2024,"Executive Summary
Each year, ADL (Anti-Defamation League) tracks incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault in the United States. Since 1979, we have published this information in an annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents.
In 2024, ADL tabulated 9,354 antisemitic incidents across the United States. This represents a 5% increase from the 8,873 incidents recorded in 2023, a 344% increase over the past five years and a 893% increase over the past 10 years. It is the highest number on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents 46 years ago.
Incidents of vandalism and assault increased significantly in 2024. Assaults increased by 21% to 196 incidents, impacting 250 victims, and vandalism increased by 20% to 2,606 incidents. Harassment incidents remained relatively steady, with an increase of 0.26%, for a total of 6,552 incidents.
For the first time in the history of the Audit, a majority (58%) of all incidents contained elements related to Israel or Zionism. A large portion of Israel-related antisemitic incidents occurred at or in the vicinity of anti-Israel protests. Out of over 5,000 anti-Israel rallies tracked by ADL in 2024, 2,596 involved antisemitic messaging in the form of signs, chants or speeches.
Incidents on college and university campuses rose more steeply than those in any other location. In 2024, ADL recorded 1,694 antisemitic incidents on college campuses, which is 84% higher than in 2023. Campus incidents comprised 18% of all incidents, a larger proportion than in any previous Audit.
While incidents decreased by 14% at Jewish institutions, they remained elevated compared to pre-October 7, 2023, levels. Jewish organizations, particularly synagogues, were targeted with hundreds of bomb threats and hundreds more general antisemitic threats. Congregants were harassed and even assaulted while at or in the vicinity of Jewish institutions, and some anti-Israel groups escalated their tactics, protesting Jewish religious and cultural institutions on dozens of occasions.
Incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As in previous years, states and metropolitan areas with the largest Jewish populations continued to report the highest levels of incidents. The states with the highest levels of incidents were New York (1,437) and California (1,344).","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/nearly-five-fold-increase-antisemitic-harassment-facebook-directed-jewish,"New York, NY, May 8, 2025, Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã‚Â  Researchers at the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society (CTS)Ã‚Â found thatÃ‚Â Jewish Members of Congress have experienced a nearly five-fold increase in antisemitic harassment on Facebook since Meta rolled back its moderation policy at the start of the year.Ã‚Â 

Following this policy shift, ADLÃ‚Â stated its deep concerns,Ã‚Â saying that this change would be a ""step backward"" and allow increased hate, antisemitism, and toxicity on Facebook and potentially its other platforms as well. To measure how much harmful content this policy change might allow through, ADL researchers collected and analyzed toxic and antisemitic comments directed at the 30 Jewish Members of Congress with Facebook accounts.

Key Findings from theÃ‚Â Research:

The average number of comments per day appears to have increased sharply (by a factor of eight) from February 4, 2025, including both hateful and non-hateful comments.
Until Feb. 4, there was an average of 6.5 antisemitic comments per day. They then spiked and remained much higher, to almost 30 per day through April 7).
This increase includes a nearly five-fold spike in antisemitic comments per day on the Facebook accounts of the 30 Jewish Members of Congress with Facebook accounts.
The proportions of antisemitic and toxic content remained relatively consistent, suggesting that Meta is dialing down all content moderation, allowing an increase in the total volume of toxic and hateful comments.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœMeta bears responsibility for the harm that its recent moderation policy roll-back has caused as it is enabling, if not actively encouraging, antisemitic, hateful, and toxic activity on its platforms,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœThis hate targeted at Jewish Members of Congress is not only unacceptable, but also a reflection of what all American Jews and regular users experience online daily across MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s social media platforms. The findings of this study reinforce our determination to request appropriate content moderation on MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s platforms and to work with all stakeholders to protect all online users from hate and harassment.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL previously found that the majority of Americans who experience online harassment are harassed on Facebook, 61 percent in the previous year, according toÃ‚Â CTSÃ¢Â€Â™s 2024 annual survey of online hate and harassment. Facebook is the most popular social media platform in the US by number of users; even still, the number of people who report harassment there is out of proportion to its popularity.

Moreover,Ã‚Â ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s latest social media scorecard released in September 2024, showed that Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram) responded to zero cases of antisemitic content when reported as average users. ADL andÃ‚Â othersÃ‚Â warned that dialing back content moderation efforts would allow toxic and hateful content to surge.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœRolling back content moderation practices means that toxicity and antisemitism are allowed to thrive even more than in the past,Ã¢Â€Â said Daniel Kelley, Director of Strategy and Operations, and Interim Head of the ADL Center for Technology and Society. Ã¢Â€ÂœADL research has consistently shown that marginalized groups are the most targeted with online identity-based harassment and that the consequence for regular users is too often to withdraw from these spaces. Meta should seriously reconsider this decision or find better ways to protect users, especially those routinely targeted with hate.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Methodology

ADL researchers collected 337,763 comments from the Facebook pages of the 30 self-identified Jewish Members of Congress with Facebook accounts between January 1 and April 7, 2025 (one additional member of Congress with a Facebook account was not included because the account was created only recently). ADL then analyzed these comments using ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s own antisemitism classifier to rate the likelihood of antisemitic content in each comment and a toxicity classifier (Google JigsawÃ¢Â€Â™s Perspective API). More details about the methodology are available in the report.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/80-years-after-wwii-seven-largest-jewish-communities-report-unprecedented,"Berlin, Germany, May 7, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â¦ As the world commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the J7 Large CommunitiesÃ¢Â€Â™ Task Force Against Antisemitism released its inaugural J7 Annual Report on Antisemitism, documenting sharp increases in antisemitic incidents in the seven largest Jewish communities outside of Israel.

The report highlights dramatic rises in both the total number of antisemitic incidents and antisemitic incidents per capita inÃ¢Â€Â”Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United StatesÃ¢Â€Â”driven in part by the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist massacre in Israel. The findings were unveiled today at a press conference in Berlin, Germany.

Ã¢Â€ÂœMeeting in Berlin today, I'm struck by both history's weight and our communities' resilience,Ã¢Â€Â said Marina Rosenberg, ADL Senior Vice President of International Affairs. Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœSince Oct. 7, 2023 antisemitism has risen to unprecedented levels in societies where the majority of Jews live in the diaspora. In response to these findings, the J7 Task Force is calling on all countries to adopt and implement the Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism. These guidelines will help to support governments, institutions, and civil society partners in developing practical policies to ensure the safety, inclusion, and dignity of Jewish communities worldwide.Ã¢Â€Â

In 2024, Australia reported a staggering 317% increase in antisemitic incidents, while the United States saw a 5% rise, reflecting the enduring impact of October 7. Additionally, preliminary data from J7 members including Canada and Germany indicate that antisemitic incidents have either continued to rise or remained at historically high levels.

From 2021 to 2023, antisemitic incidents spiked by 11% in Australia, 23% in Argentina, 72% in Germany, 83% in Canada, 90% in the UK, 185% in France, and 227% in the US.

Antisemitic incidents in each J7 country by year.

Year-on-year percentage increase in antisemitic incidents in each J7 country.

The rate of antisemitic incidents per Jewish capita has reached alarming levels, underscoring the increased vulnerability of Jewish communities globally. In Germany, there were more than 38 antisemitic incidents for every 1,000 Jewish residents in 2023. The U.K. followed with over 13 incidents per 1,000 Jewish residents.

This report also identifies several common trends across J7 countries: a rise in violent antisemitic incidents, repeated targeting of Jewish institutions including synagogues, schools, and community centers; an escalation of online hate; growing insecurity leading some Jews to hide their identity; and government failure to hold accountable those who engage in antisemitic violence or support terrorism against the Jewish state.Ã‚Â 

Leaders of the J7 Task Force communities shared their perspectives on this troubling global surge of antisemitism:

Argentina - Mauro Berenstein, President, DAIA:Ã‚Â ""In Argentina, we see with concern the exponential rise of antisemitism, in educational, academic, and professional settings, where many people, under the guise of critical thinking or a just cause, reproduce age-old prejudices. Social media has amplified these narratives. What was once whispered now goes viral in seconds. Therefore, more than ever, memory and education are not just tools of the past: they are a duty of the present and a hope for the future.""

Australia Ã¢Â€Â“ Alex Ryvchin, Co-CEO, Executive Council of Australian Jewry: Ã¢Â€ÂœThis report presents the most comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon of antisemitism in the western world since October 7. All of our communities have been afflicted by this, but the situation in Australia presents a particularly staggering depiction of how healthy multicultural societies can be captured by networks of extremists who succeed in fundamentally altering relations between Jews and non-Jews and causing the Jewish community to question its future in a country where its roots are deep and its contributions have been profound. The Australian experience also illustrates that when antisemitism is not met with sufficient force of policing, law and political leadership, it can escalate into devastating violence and can attract the most vicious elements of society ranging from religious and ideological fanatics to organised crime. The importance and value of this report is a testament to the work of the ADL in convening the J7 and the outstanding cooperation between its member communities.Ã¢Â€Â

Canada - Noah Shack, Interim President, CIJA:Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœSince October 7, Canada has experienced a wave of antisemitic attacks Ã¢Â€Â” with Jewish schools shot at, synagogues firebombed, Jewish-owned businesses vandalized, and neighbourhoods targeted. The challenges facing Canada's Jewish community are immense. In the wake of last week's federal election, we have a clear expectation that the next Parliament will move urgently to advance serious and impactful solutions to combat hate and protect Jewish Canadians. What is at stake is not only the safety and well-being of our community, but the future of a Canada where everyone can live free from fear and discrimination.Ã¢Â€Â

France - Yonathan Arfi, President, CRIF:Ã‚Â ""As President of the CRIF, I stand alongside our J7 partners in sounding the alarm over the disturbing surge in antisemitism that has swept through France since the atrocities of October 7. What we are witnessing is not just a statistical increase, it is a societal warning sign. This is not a crisis for the Jewish community, it is a test for our democracies. The escalation in hate speech, threats, and physical assaults against Jews around the world reminds us why international cooperation, like that of the J7, is more vital than ever.""

Germany - Dr. Josef Schuster, President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany: Ã¢Â€ÂœOctober 7, 2023 has massively accelerated a development that was already looming. Jews in Germany are under threat. A front has formed, cutting across the left and right, from Islamists to the very center of society. This coalition questions the self-evidence of todayÃ¢Â€Â™s Jewish life as well as GermanyÃ¢Â€Â™s culture of remembrance. These developments are overlapping and mutually influencing online and offline. We are seeing similar developments in all the J7 countries and I am glad that this strong task force exists. As we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, it is a great honor for the Central Council to welcome the J7 representatives to Berlin and share our work with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others.Ã¢Â€Â

United Kingdom Ã¢Â€Â“ Phil Rosenberg, President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews:Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœWe at the Board of Deputies of British Jews are proud to have worked with our J7 Partners on this collective report looking at antisemitic trends across our countries. The sharp rise in antisemitic attacks that we all saw following the 7th October massacres, and the subsequent trends since then, are living proof of the value that the J7 brings to Jewish communities around the world. We must insist on zero tolerance of antisemitism and ensure that this message gets through to lawmakers wherever we live.""

United States - Betsy Berns-Korn, Chair-Elect of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations:Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœEighty years after the end of World War II, Jewish leaders from across the world have come together to reaffirm a simple truth: that we will never allow hatred to define our future. Rooted in memory, guided by justice, and strengthened by unity, we reaffirm our commitment to securing a safer and more inclusive world for generations to come.Ã‚Â  This inaugural report reflects the strength of our collective voice and unwavering resolve.""

The J7, theÃ‚Â Large CommunitiesÃ¢Â€Â™ Task Force Against Antisemitism, was formed in response to increasing rates of antisemitism around the world and comprises Jewish organizations in the Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/white-supremacists-help-raise-hundreds-thousands-woman-who-hurled-slur-black,"Over the last week, white supremacists, antisemites and racists have been supporting a woman accused of calling a Black child a racial slur by helping to coordinate her donation drive and raising hundreds of thousands of dollars. They have leveraged the fundraising campaign to spread hateful talking points and legitimize their ideas.

The woman, identified in media reports as Shiloh Hendrix, was depicted in a video that began circulating on social media on April 28, 2025, allegedly accosting a Black five-year-old at a playground in Rochester, Minnesota. In the video, the man recording asks the woman if she called the child a n***er, and she responds by hurling the slur at the man recording as well.

On May 1, 2025, a crowdfunding campaign was created on GiveSendGoÃ¢Â€Â”a prominent facilitator of extremist crowdfundingÃ¢Â€Â”to raise funds for Hendrix. It is unclear who was authentically involved in creating the campaign, although several X users known to promote extremist and anti-Black rhetoric have since claimed shared responsibility for coordinating the effort. They assert that Hendrix will be the primary recipient of the funds, and the GiveSendGo campaign page indicates this is the case.

The GiveSendGo campaign immediately went viral on X, and the link to the page was mentioned over 25,000 times in the days that followed the circulation of the video. As of this writing, the campaign has received over $700,000 of its $1,000,000 goal from over 26,500 donors, with many of the donation comments containing white supremacist, racist and antisemitic messaging, names and denominations.

White Supremacist Donations Filled with Hate

A COE review of 23,409 donations (as of May 4, 2025, at 1:45 pm EDT) for the GiveSendGo campaign found that 13,031 (or 56%) of donations included a comment and/or a name (the remaining contributors left the space for this information blank). Further review of the donations with a comment and/or name found that 3,935 (roughly 30%) included white supremacist, racist or antisemitic content.

The comments and donation names included a wide variety of racial slurs against Black people, white supremacist and Nazi symbols, and calls for the killing or deportation of non-whites and Jews. Dozens used their donation comment to leverage antisemitic conspiracy theories. Such messages included:Ã‚Â  ""J3ws are the reason we are in this mess,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœJews have been flooding our countries with the bioweapons for centuries,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœJews are using diverse immigrants to dilute the white populationÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœThe goyim are figuring out Jews are using non-whites to wage their ancient war against God.""

Soon, the number of hateful comments ballooned and GiveSendGo disabled the ability to leave comments with donations, though the platform notably did not shut down the campaign itself. After comments were disabled, donors exploited the name field to continue to spread their hatred. Fourteen of the top 20 most repeated donor names include white supremacist or racist references, including the spoonerism Ã¢Â€ÂœNate HiggersÃ¢Â€Â (130 times), Ã¢Â€Âœwhite lives matterÃ¢Â€Â (24), and Ã¢Â€ÂœTNDÃ¢Â€Â [Total N***er Death] (19).

Donations were also made in denominations of white supremacist numerical codes such as 14 and 88. At the time of this report, there were 693 donations of $14, 99 donations of $88, and 26 donations that used variations of 1488.

After GiveSendGo disabled comments on the Hendrix campaign, white supremacists continued to use the name and alias fields to spread their vitriol. (Screenshot/GiveSendGo)Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

White Supremacists Organize Donations

From the start, the campaign to raise money for Hendrix has been promoted by white supremacist X users. One user, who identifies himself as Ã¢Â€ÂœOrganizer & Admin for the Shiloh Hendrix campaignÃ¢Â€Â in his X bio, has a history of espousing extremist tropes and racist rhetoric, including conspiracy theories about Ã¢Â€Âœwhite replacementÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœwhite genocide.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Other white supremacist users promoting the campaign have claimed to be in contact with Hendrix herself and clarified that she would be receiving all of the money.

White supremacists are using the Hendrix incident, coupled with the April 2025 fatal stabbing of a white teen, Austin Metcalf in Frisco, Texas, to promote the false Black-on-white crime narrative that Black people are inherently violent and are a threat to white people. This narrative has been a major driver for donations to the Hendrix campaign, with white supremacists pushing supporters to her campaign in a bid to outraise another GiveSendGo campaign, one benefiting Karmelo Anthony, the Black teen accused of stabbing Metcalf. Hundreds of comments on the Hendrix campaign page reference Metcalf or Anthony.

On X, white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes referred to the Hendrix fundraiser as Ã¢Â€Âœa middle fingerÃ¢Â€Â to certain Black people, including Anthony, concluding that Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite people have had enough.Ã¢Â€Â

Nick Fuentes compares the Shiloh Hendrix incident to instances of 'black-on-white crime' often touted by white supremacists. (Screenshot/X)Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Several prominent white supremacist influencers and groups appear to have donated to the Hendrix fundraising campaign, using the campaign to promote themselves and their groups. Prominent white supremacist influencer Paul Miller AKA Gypsy Crusader, appears to have donated $50 to Hendrix, calling her a Ã¢Â€Âœbased queen.Ã¢Â€Â Alleged organizers of the campaign have named Miller as one of the individuals Ã¢Â€Âœdirectly involved in running & administeringÃ¢Â€Â the crowdfunding effort.Ã‚Â  Miller claimed on X that he was Ã¢Â€Âœvery proud to be part of it.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Chris Pohlhaus, the founder and leader of Blood Tribe, appears to have donated $20. White supremacist Ryan J. Murdough of the New England White Network (NEWN) also appears to have donated at least $75, writing, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou have support from all over the nation. Please consider moving to New England. You have a pre existing [sic] network of racially aware White [sic] families already here waiting for you,Ã¢Â€Â along with links to his Gab account. An individual promoting the white supremacist group Hate Club donated $20 and included the 14 Words in their message. Similarly, a user promoting the American Blackshirts Movement (ABM) donated $14, urging viewers to join ABM and Ã¢Â€Âœforget white guilt.Ã¢Â€Â The Pennsylvania chapter of White Lives Matter (WLM) appears to have donated $14 and included a link to the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s Telegram channel.

Several donors promoted the antisemitic Goyim Defense League (GDL), with one large $1,488 donation calling Black people Ã¢Â€ÂœsavagesÃ¢Â€Â and including a Ã¢Â€ÂœshoutoutÃ¢Â€Â to GoyimTV, the networkÃ¢Â€Â™s video streaming service. Many of the donations included links to GDL websites. A well-known affiliate of the network appears to have donated $14 to Hendrix, thanking her for Ã¢Â€Âœcalling out these j*wish [sic] funded 3rd world bioweapons,Ã¢Â€Â along with a link to the networkÃ¢Â€Â™s propaganda website.

Various Active Clubs also ostensibly donated to the campaign, also using it to promote themselves. Palmetto Active Club (SC) appears to have donated $60, and Tribal Active Club, (AZ) Wyoming Active Club and Great Plains Active Club appear to have donated $20 each.

The prominentÃ‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœWestern ChauvinistÃ¢Â€Â Telegram channel, affiliated with the Proud Boys, made and forwarded several posts supporting Hendrix, with one reading, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite guilt is over.Ã‚Â  We have officially destroyed it.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  The same post was shared by the white supremacistÃ‚Â Atlantic Nationalist Club (ANC). An X account affiliated with the white supremacist group Blood Tribe made a repost to the platform praising Hendrix that linked to the GiveSendGo campaign.

On the Ground Impact

Beyond providing online and financial support, white supremacists have demonstrated their backing for Hendrix in the physical world. For example, during a May 3 demonstration in Toronto, Canada, a group of white supremacistsÃ¢Â€Â”including individuals associated with Nationalist 13 and severalÃ‚Â Active ClubsÃ¢Â€Â”chanted, Ã¢Â€ÂœShiloh Hendrix did nothing wrong.Ã¢Â€Â

Several white supremacist groups also distributed propaganda related to the incident. The white supremacist National Organization for Vital Action (NOVA) placed several stickers at the Rochester, Minnesota, playground where the incident took place, with one sticker reading, Ã¢Â€ÂœAccess to whites is not a human right,Ã¢Â€Â and another reading, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite unity.Ã¢Â€Â A Midwest-based Active Club also made a post showing the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s stickers in Rochester.Ã‚Â American Freedom Party (AFP) posted stickers with HendrixÃ¢Â€Â™s face and the caption, Ã¢Â€ÂœStand against anti-White terror campaigns,Ã¢Â€Â at unknown locations in central Massachusetts.","[1, 2, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Antisemitism in K-12 schools has become a pressing national concern, with 1,162 antisemitic incidents recorded in 2023 and 860 antisemitic incidents recorded in 2024 in K-12 schools alone, according to recent data from ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. Since 2020, incidents at K-12 schools have spiked by an alarming 434%. In light of the persistently high rates of antisemitic incidents in K-12 schools, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Ratings and Assessments Institute (RAI) and Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) launched a new initiative to examine antisemitism within non-Jewish independent/private K-12 schools, henceforth referred to as independent K-12 schools. Independent K-12 schools were selected as the subject of the research as they operate outside of the direct oversight of public education systems, meaning they typically have greater autonomy in shaping their curricula, policies, and disciplinary procedures, which can lead to inconsistent responses to antisemitism. By examining this specific sector, we aim to highlight unique challenges and identify gaps in accountability, reporting and education that may not be as visible in public schools.

To kick off this initiative, RAI and CCAE conducted focus groups and a survey of parents of Jewish children who attend independent K-12 schools. We recruited participants through ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s established networks, including its 25 regional offices, which maintain connections with Jewish stakeholders and community leaders throughout the country. This study aimed to assess the independent school climate for Jewish students amidst heightened tensions due to the Israel-Hamas conflict and identify methods to better support Jewish students and their families in these settings. The findings, detailed in this report, highlight the urgent need to protect Jewish students in independent K-12 schools and foster an inclusive and safe educational environment for all.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/swaths-anti-zionist-movement-legitimize-killings-israeli-embassy-staff-dc-jewish,"Many anti-Zionist activists, influencers, and social media users across platforms have responded to the double murder Wednesday night of two Israeli embassy staffers at a reception for diplomats and Jewish young professionals at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. with a mix of outright celebration, glee, and justification for the killings. Some even called for additional violence and praised the murder suspect as a hero of the anti-Zionist movement.Ã‚Â 

Some prominent groups in the movement did condemn the murders, however, their responses were then met with criticism or mockery from other anti-Zionists. Reactions from various other extremists and conspiracy theorists have also included antisemitic accusations and immediate claims of a Ã¢Â€Âœfalse flagÃ¢Â€Â operation.Ã‚Â 

The suspect, 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, Illinois, was taken into custody the night of May 21, 2025,Ã‚Â  shouting, Ã¢Â€ÂœFree, free Palestine,Ã¢Â€Â after fatally shooting Israeli embassy staffers Yaron Lischinsky (an Israeli citizen) and Sarah Milgrim (a U.S. citizen), as they were exiting an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC). Rodriguez told police who arrived at the scene, Ã¢Â€ÂœI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza.Ã¢Â€Â

Praise for Rodriguez and Calls for Further Action

RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s words and actions have been cheered by various anti-Zionist groups and influencers, as has a manifesto posted to his X account that the ADL Center on Extremism has, with a high degree of certainty, linked to him.

The manifesto, titled Ã¢Â€ÂœEscalate For Gaza, Bring The War HomeÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” slogans commonly used by anti-Israel activists, particularly in more extreme, militant spaces Ã¢Â€Â” was turned into a printable, distributable zine by multiple anti-Zionist groups. One such example was created and shared by Unity of Fields, a far-left anti-Zionist Ã¢Â€Âœdirect action networkÃ¢Â€Â that supports the targeting of Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistÃ¢Â€Â individuals and institutions, which reproduced RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s words in a zine that also included prominent imagery of a gun.

In a series of posts, Unity of Fields commented, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe ainÃ¢Â€Â™t condemning shit,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœFREE ELIAS RODRIGUEZ!Ã¢Â€Â and referred to the suspect as a Ã¢Â€Âœpolitical prisoner.Ã¢Â€Â The groupÃ¢Â€Â¯doubled down in yet another post on X Friday, claiming that Rodriguez was acting out of Ã¢Â€Âœsolidarity and love for the Palestinian people.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

The Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a radical New York-based anti-Israel group, wrote on X: Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat Elias Rodriguez did is the highest expression of anti-Zionism.Ã¢Â€Â In a similar post to its Telegram channel, the group added: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe need more Elias Rodriguez in the world.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

On X, anti-Zionist influencer Zei Squirrel, an account with some 280,000 followers, wrote: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe elimination of Israeli regime assets is the most moral act in human history per the standards of the genocidal Zionist Western media and political class.Ã¢Â€Â

Anti-Zionist influencer Guy Christensen declared from his @YourFavoriteGuy account to his 3.4 million TikTok followers, Ã¢Â€ÂœI do not condemn the elimination of those two Zionist officials.Ã¢Â€Â He told his followers, Ã¢Â€ÂœI want to urge you first to support Elias's actions. He is not a terrorist. He's a resistance fighter.Ã¢Â€Â Christensen encouraged his followers to meet a potential Ã¢Â€Âœcrackdown on the movement...with escalation and stronger resistance.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Susan Abulhawa, an anti-Israel author and activist, posted on X: Ã¢Â€ÂœNatural logic: when governments fail to hold Israel accountable for an actual holocaust being committed before our very eyes, no genocidal Zionist should be safe anywhere in the world.Ã¢Â€Â She added in another post, Ã¢Â€ÂœNow weÃ¢Â€Â™re supposed to feel bad for two genocide cheerleaders after watching these colonizer baby killers slaughter people by the hundreds every day for two years. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen the inside of too many childrenÃ¢Â€Â™s skulls to give a crap about the human garbage who get off on mass murder.Ã¢Â€Â

The California-based, far-left anti-Zionist group the United Liberation Front for Palestine shared the news about the shooting on its Instagram page with close to 30,000 followers with the comment, Ã¢Â€ÂœMAY ALL ZIONISTS BURN.Ã¢Â€Â It also reshared Unity of FieldsÃ¢Â€Â™ comment on not condemning the killings.

Ã‚Â 

Resistance News Network (RNN) andÃ‚Â Palestine News Network (PNN), extreme anti-Zionist groups that also post content praising anti-Israel terror and violence, also expressed support for the shooting. In the popular RNN Telegram channel, hundreds of people reacted with celebratory emojis to the post announcing the attack.

PNN leader David Wolff posted a screenshot on Instagram of a news story about the shooting that featured a photograph of Lischinsky and added the caption, Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath to Nazis.Ã¢Â€Â

Additional Justification for the Shooting

Even others who did not outright celebrate the murders nonetheless found ways to justify or excuse them, including frequently utilizing Nazi-related commentary.

Eyup Lovely, an X account with some 65,000 followers, posted mockingly: Ã¢Â€ÂœMy heart breaks for the two innocent staffers of the German Reich embassy who were robbed of their lives by senseless anti Germanic violence last night. I have telegraphed my sympathies to the FÃƒÂ¼hrer for the Volksgenossen community.Ã¢Â€Â

Aidan Simardone, a Canadian lawyer and writer, garnered more than five thousand likes on a post on X mocking Ã¢Â€ÂœEvery Ã¢Â€Â˜progressiveÃ¢Â€Â™ politician: I oppose the Holocaust, but oppose the killing of Nazi Germany embassy staff.Ã¢Â€Â

Palestinian activist Mohammed El-Kurd, who writes for The Nation and Mondoweiss, shared a post that compared the murders of the two Israeli Embassy staffers to the 1938 killing of a Nazi diplomat at the hands of a Jewish refugee in Paris. El-Kurd also denied that the shooting was Ã¢Â€Âœa random antisemitic attackÃ¢Â€Â and alleged Ã¢Â€Âœit was undeniably, and by the alleged shooterÃ¢Â€Â™s own admission, a response to the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza.Ã¢Â€Â

The line of argument that the attack was not antisemitic Ã¢Â€Â” even as the suspect targeted a Jewish event at a Jewish institution with a significant number of Jewish attendees Ã¢Â€Â” also resonated with Candace Owens, the right-wing public figure and political commentator who has come to embrace and promote antisemitic tropes and extreme anti-Israel rhetoric.

In her show on Thursday, posted to over 4.5 million subscribers, Owens referred to the characterization of the shooting as an antisemitic attack as Ã¢Â€Âœdesperate,Ã¢Â€Â and said the Ã¢Â€ÂœZionists have lost the moral argument...Too many Americans are awakened to this, especially the youth are awakened to these sorts of tactics. And they just did too much too fast, trying to cancel too many people, trying to call everybody literally Hitler.Ã¢Â€Â

Khaled Barakat, who is sanctioned by the U.S. government for his ties to the terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and is a leader of the transnational anti-Israel groups Samidoun and Masar Badil, stated that Ã¢Â€Âœtargeting employees of the Ã¢Â€Â˜IsraeliÃ¢Â€Â™ embassy, is a natural consequence of the Zionist entityÃ¢Â€Â™s crimes in the Gaza Strip.Ã¢Â€Â

Charlotte Kates, BarakatÃ¢Â€Â™s partner and Samidoun's international coordinator, similarly commented: Ã¢Â€ÂœIt should surprise...no one at all that people will act when there is no accountability whatsoever imposed upon that genocidal regime...Genocide has to have consequences.Ã¢Â€Â

Haz Al-Din, one of the founding members of the American Communist Party (ACP), whose openly pro-terror activities include attending former Hezbollah leader Hassan NasrallahÃ¢Â€Â™s funeral in Lebanon earlier this year, commented, Ã¢Â€ÂœI DO NOT support or encourage violence. However, Zionists have NO moral leg to stand on.Ã¢Â€Â

The International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network (IJAN), a group that facilitates global anti-Israel activity on the part of anti-Zionist Jews, posted on Instagram to its close to 70,000 followers that the shooting was just ""consequences"" for Israel's actions and ""a response to the genocide in Gaza."" It further said that the ""attack is precedented and the precedent was set by Israel.""

Ã‚Â 

Criticism Toward Those Condemning the Murders

Various anti-Zionist activists also reacted by mocking those within the anti-Israel movement who condemned the shooting. TheÃ‚Â Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), for example, put out a statement attempting to distance itself from Rodriguez Ã¢Â€Â” who was affiliated with the group for a time in 2017 and 2018 Ã¢Â€Â” and saying that they Ã¢Â€Âœdo not supportÃ¢Â€Â the shooting. Joe Catron, a longtime anti-Israel activist who has been involved with Samidoun and theÃ‚Â International Solidarity Movement (ISM), responded to PSLÃ¢Â€Â™s post by asking, Ã¢Â€ÂœSo were all those Ã¢Â€Â˜resistance is justified!Ã¢Â€Â™ chants you led outright lies?Ã¢Â€Â in reference to theÃ‚Â slogan frequently used by PSL at their anti-Israel protests.

Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) was also among the anti-Israel groups to condemn the shooting, posting from its national account: Ã¢Â€ÂœAll human life is precious, which is precisely why we are struggling for a world in which all people can live in safety and dignity.Ã¢Â€Â The United Liberation Front for Palestine commented in response: Ã¢Â€ÂœAnd anyone who condemns [the shooting] will be telling on themselves.Ã¢Â€Â

Lamis Deek, a New York-based anti-Zionist leader with the groupÃ‚Â Al-Awda, responded by equating JVPÃ¢Â€Â™s statement to excusing Nazis: Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â˜American born Himler converted to Nazism to defend Nazis from accusations of forced famine and secure money and weapons for Nazi Germany, shot by activist who yelled Ã¢Â€Â˜Free the Jews.Ã¢Â€Â™ JVP and US establishment condemn anti-German violence, send condolences to global Nazi family.Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â

Zainab Chaudry, director of the Maryland chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), put out a statement standing against Ã¢Â€Âœall forms of violence, including political violence,Ã¢Â€Â adding that while the organization shares Ã¢Â€Âœthe immense pain and anguish over Israel's ongoing U.S backed genocide and famine in Gaza. It is not the answer. We stand against tactics that undermine the just and righteous cause for a free Palestine.Ã¢Â€Â

CAIR Chicago director Ahmed Rehab also condemned the shooting, but couched it by stating, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe stand squarely against vigilante violence Ã¢Â€Â” even against those who may be complicit in genocide.Ã¢Â€Â","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.0, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/extremists-and-conspiracy-theorists-deny-capital-jewish-museum-shooting-false,"In the wake of the murder of two Israeli embassy staff members at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., conspiracy theories about the shooting quickly circulated on social media from users across the political spectrum. The most prevalent of these conspiratorial posts alleged that the shooting was a purposeful and coordinated Ã¢Â€Âœfalse flagÃ¢Â€Â attack carried out by the Israeli or U.S. government to make Jews and Israel look sympathetic, tighten relations between the two countries or rationalize going to war with Iran. Others claimed that the shooting was intended to justify measures cracking down on free speech and dissent regarding the Israel-Hamas war. These conspiracy theories follow a disturbing yet predictable narrative among antisemites and extreme anti-Zionists, particularly since the October 7, 2023 Hamas terror attacks in Israel: the belief that Jews, Zionists and Israelis are to blame for the violence and harassment targeting them, and that demonizing them is more important than the truth.

Blaming Israel
Some anti-Zionist and antisemitic influencers alleged that Israel, Mossad or the Israel Defense Forces orchestrated the shooting, though they had different reasons why. In some far-right extremist spaces, some claimed that the attack was intended to make Jews and Israel more sympathetic. As one user wrote, the attack makes them Ã¢Â€Âœthe victims againÃ¢Â€Â just as countries were Ã¢Â€Âœcooling on IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s endless genocide in gaza [sic].Ã¢Â€Â Another wrote, Ã¢Â€ÂœJews pulling off psyop, false flag shootings as they destroy the world, genocide entire peoples. A man did something to someone near the Ã¢Â€Â˜DC Jewish museumÃ¢Â€Â™ dedicated to the Ã¢Â€Â˜HolocaustÃ¢Â€Â™ fairytale. Let us mourn for their psyop.Ã¢Â€Â

Similarly, some suggested that the attack was carried out to strengthen U.S.-Israeli relations in response to perceived friction between the two countries. Others suggested the shooting was a Mossad operation or coordinated by Zionists to distract the world from the Israel-Hamas war.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Still others asserted that Israel would use the attack to justify going to war with Iran. For example, Gateway Pundit journalist Elijah Schaffer wrote in an X post with over 419,000 views and 15,000 likes that Ã¢Â€ÂœIsrael would kill their ownÃ¢Â€Â for this very purpose. Schaffer also drew from older conspiracy theories to back up his claim, alleging that Israel helped coordinate the attacks on October 7, 2023, and that 9/11 was an inside job to justify going to war.Ã‚Â 

AdameMedia Ã¢Â€Â” a popular conspiratorial X account with over 323K followers Ã¢Â€Â” argued in a post with over 55,000 views and 4,600 likes that the Ã¢Â€Â˜false flagÃ¢Â€Â™ theory was the most plausible explanation, stating Ã¢Â€ÂœThe quality of Israeli false flag [sic] has fallen drastically since 9/11.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Blaming the U.S. GovernmentÃ‚Â 
As is common in the wake of highly salient events, some conspiracy theorists online claimed that the attack was not the work of a single shooter, but instead a product of a U.S. government conspiracy. On X, far-right influencer Jackson Hinkle claimed in a post with more than 111,000 views and 4,000 likes that the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) Ã¢Â€Â” an anti-Zionist organization that the alleged gunman was previously affiliated with Ã¢Â€Â” is working with U.S. federal agents, declaring the Ã¢Â€ÂœassassinationÃ¢Â€Â was Ã¢Â€Âœa false flag.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

Others went even further to declare that the U.S. government was operating on behalf of Mossad. One X user wrote that the Ã¢Â€ÂœFBI is a mossad [sic] extension.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Users affiliated with the antisemitic X broadcast network JQ Radio suggested the shooting was partially coordinated by the CIA, positing that the suspect Ã¢Â€Âœwas connected to an intelligence agencyÃ¢Â€Â and may have been Ã¢Â€ÂœtrainedÃ¢Â€Â by the FBI to carry out the shooting.

Attack on Free SpeechÃ‚Â 
Shortly after news broke of the shooting, there were baseless claims that the attack would be used to erode free speech in the United States. As white supremacist streamer and influencer Nick Fuentes wrote on X in a post with 1.8 million views and 39,000 likes, Ã¢Â€ÂœFalse flag, right on schedule,Ã¢Â€Â asserting that the demise of Ã¢Â€Âœfree speech and diplomacyÃ¢Â€Â was imminent. Several other antisemitic and anti-Zionist figures agreed that the attack was designed to target free speech and to silence promoters of anti-Israel rhetoric. On Instagram, X and Bluesky, anti-Zionist influencer and MintPress journalist Greg Stoker shied away from calling it a false flag, but claimed the shooting would result in the loss of Ã¢Â€Âœfree speech and dissentÃ¢Â€Â either way.","[1, 2, 4]","{1: 0.6, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.5}",HIGH

Ã‚Â 

We are devastated by the antisemitic terrorist shooting targeting the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., killing two young people at the prime of their lives who had been attending an American Jewish Committee event for young leadership on diplomatic humanitarian projects.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

The threat of antisemitic violence and terrorism targeting Jewish institutions and Jewish people is a daily reality for our communities. Particularly in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, we have seen the exponential rise in antisemitic actions and threats along with a continual drumbeat of rhetoric that incites and justifies this hate.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

This heinous attack is yet another wake-up call that governments, law enforcement and societies worldwide need to take language and threats directed against the Jewish community seriously and ensure our communities have the security they need.Ã‚Â  In the past decade, Jews have been killed in their synagogues, kosher grocery stores, and their homes. Antisemitic attitudes, stereotypes, and conspiracy theories have become more normalized. They are a threat not only to Jewish communities but also to the freedoms and rights of all people.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli-German and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, an American from Kansas, who were staffers at the Israeli Embassy in Washington.Ã‚Â  May their memories be a blessing.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

As he was taken into custody, Rodriguez shouted, Ã¢Â€ÂœFree, free Palestine.""

An online manifesto posted on X lays out the reasons for the attack. The ADL Center on Extremism has been able to connect the alleged suspect, with a high degree of certainty, to the X account and the manifesto, shared under the heading Ã¢Â€ÂœEscalate For Gaza, Bring The War HomeÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” slogans commonly used by anti-Israel activists, particularly in more extreme, militant spaces.

Extreme Anti-Israel Beliefs

The text of RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s alleged manifesto reflected an apparent trajectory of radicalization as the author stated that non-violent protests against IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s actions in Gaza have been insufficient and that the Ã¢Â€Âœperpetrators and abettorsÃ¢Â€Â of genocide have Ã¢Â€Âœforfeited their humanity.Ã¢Â€Â The author noted that Ã¢Â€Âœnonviolent protest in the opening weeks of the genocide seemed to signal some sort of turning pointÃ¢Â€Â¦But thus far the rhetoric has not amounted to much.Ã¢Â€Â It then went on to praise Aaron Bushnell, the 25-year-old active-duty United States Airman who died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., on February 25, 2024.Ã‚Â 

The manifesto concluded with a section about Ã¢Â€Âœthe morality of armed demonstration,Ã¢Â€Â in which the author commented that Ã¢Â€Âœthe action would have been morally justified taken 11 years ago during Protective Edge [IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s name for its military operation in the 2014 Gaza war], around the time I personally became acutely aware of our brutal conduct in Palestine,Ã¢Â€Â but acknowledged that such an action would have seemed Ã¢Â€ÂœillegibleÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€ÂœinsaneÃ¢Â€Â to Ã¢Â€Âœmost AmericansÃ¢Â€Â at the time. He concluded that now, in 2025, armed action seems like Ã¢Â€Âœthe only sane thing to do.Ã¢Â€Â The author signed off with: ""Free Palestine, Elias Rodriguez.""Ã‚Â 

Additional posts made by the X account over the past 20 months echo similarly extreme anti-Israel sentiments, such as language in one post declaring Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath To IsraelÃ¢Â€Â and in another calling a Jewish individual a Ã¢Â€Âœzionazi [sic].Ã¢Â€Â The account also shared openly pro-terror content, including reposting videos of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah; commenting, Ã¢Â€ÂœGod bless them,Ã¢Â€Â on a post about Houthi missiles launched toward Tel Aviv; and reposting a tweet after the 2024 U.S. presidential election that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœDonÃ¢Â€Â™t Blame Me, I Voted For Hamas.Ã¢Â€Â

Background on Rodriguez

Based on posts shared on RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s alleged X account, he appears to have participated in anti-Israel protests in Chicago following HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. In one such post, the X account shared footage from a large protest held in the city on October 21, 2023.

Research by the ADL Center on Extremism shows that Rodriguez was previously affiliated with two prominent anti-Israel organizations, ANSWER Coalition and the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), and participated in multiple ANSWER and PSL protests in Chicago from late 2017 through early 2018.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

Rodriguez spoke at an October 2017 protest organized by ANSWER, the PeopleÃ¢Â€Â™s Congress of Resistance and Black Lives Matter Women of Faith, demanding justice for Laquan McDonald, who was shot and killed by police in Chicago in 2014.Ã¢Â€Â¯In an article published about the protest on the PSL website Ã¢Â€ÂœLiberation News,Ã¢Â€Â Rodriquez was described as being affiliated with PSL and photographs show Rodriquez holding an ANSWER sign.Ã‚Â 

Rodriguez also participated in a series of ANSWER protests against the city of ChicagoÃ¢Â€Â™s bid to become the site of a new Amazon headquarters. In local news media coverage of a January 2018 protest on this issue, he was identified as a member of ANSWER.

Reactions

In the hours after the D.C. shooting on Wednesday, PSL attempted to distance itself from Rodriguez, posting from its national account: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe reject any attempt to associate the PSL with the DC shooting. Elias Rodriguez is not a member of the PSL. He had a brief association with one branch of the PSL that ended in 2017. We know of no contact with him in over 7 years. We have nothing to do with this shooting and do not support it.Ã¢Â€Â

Anti-Israel activists quickly responded to the shooting, with many celebrating the violence and attempting to justify it. Masar Badil, a transnational anti-Israel organization connected to the terror-affiliated group Samidoun, wrote that the shooting Ã¢Â€Âœtargeting employees of the Ã¢Â€Â˜IsraeliÃ¢Â€Â™ embassy, is a natural consequence of the Zionist entityÃ¢Â€Â™s crimes in the Gaza Strip.Ã¢Â€Â Charlotte Kates, international coordinator of Samidoun, responded: Ã¢Â€ÂœIt should surprise...no one at all that people will act when there is no accountability whatsoever imposed upon that genocidal regime...Genocide has to have consequences.Ã¢Â€Â

Unity of Fields (formerly Palestine Action U.S.), a far-left anti-Zionist Ã¢Â€Âœdirect action networkÃ¢Â€Â that supports the targeting of Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistÃ¢Â€Â individuals and institutions, retweeted KatesÃ¢Â€Â™s response and additionally commented: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe ainÃ¢Â€Â™t condemning shitÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœFREE ELIAS RODRIGUEZ!Ã¢Â€Â

The group also published a zine of RodriguezÃ¢Â€Â™s alleged manifesto Ã¢Â€Â” emphasizing his use of the Ã¢Â€ÂœEscalate For Gaza, Bring The War HomeÃ¢Â€Â language, alongside an image of a gun Ã¢Â€Â” and referred to him as a Ã¢Â€Âœpolitical prisoner,Ã¢Â€Â as federal authorities investigate the attack.

Resistance News Network (RNN) and Palestine News Network (PNN), extreme anti-Zionist groups that also post content praising anti-Israel terror and violence, also expressed support for the shooting. In the popular RNN Telegram channel, hundreds of people reacted with celebratory emojis to the post announcing the attack.

Unsurprisingly, far-right extremist spaces have also responded to the shooting by celebrating the deaths of the victims. Some cheered their perceived enemies fighting each other: as one white supremacist wrote, Ã¢Â€ÂœRejoice when your enemies kill each other.Ã¢Â€Â When the shooterÃ¢Â€Â™s identity was announced, some far-right extremists took the opportunity to further spread anti-immigrant sentiments, despite no evidence that the shooter was an immigrant, while others joked about their identity. One white supremacist wrote regarding the shooter, Ã¢Â€ÂœDoing the job Americans wonÃ¢Â€Â™t yadda yadda yadda.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Various social media users, including some prominent antisemitic and anti-Israel influencers, reacted to the shooting by quickly spreading unfounded conspiracy theories, including alleging that the shooting was a false flag operation. Some also claimed that this attack would be used to make Israel and Jews the ""victim"" again.Ã‚Â 

Broader Context

This latest attack comes amid an unprecedentedly high threat environment for Jewish communities in the U.S. and across the world. Jewish institutions, including synagogues, community centers and museums, have been the targets of 1,702 antisemitic incidents in 2024, according to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents in the U.S. Of those incidents, 631 were related to Israel, including 86 which occurred at anti-Israel rallies in the vicinity of those institutions.

This is the eighth terrorist plot or attack targeting Jews, Zionists, or Jewish institutions since July 2024:

April 13, 2025. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:Ã‚Â Cody Balmer allegedlyÃ‚Â broke into Pennsylvania Gov.

New York, NY, May 22, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today issued the following statement in response to last nightÃ¢Â€Â™s heinous attack against two individuals attending an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. hosted by the American Jewish Committee. The suspect in the killings of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, both employees at the Israeli Embassy, is reported to have shouted Ã¢Â€ÂœFree, Free PalestineÃ¢Â€Â as he was being taken into custody.

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

Our hearts are broken for the victims of this heinous attack against a young couple attending an American Jewish Committee (AJC) event in Washington D.C. This was not just against the Jewish community of D.C., but an assault on all Jewish Americans and indeed all Americans.

We know that words have consequences. When antisemitic rhetoric is normalized, tolerated, or even amplified in our public discourse, it creates an environment where violence against Jews becomes more likely. In a climate of relentless antisemitism in the U.S. and globally since Oct. 7, 2023, unfortunately, this tragedy was inevitable. Already it has led to Jewish students on campus being attacked in libraries and on the quad, Jews walking to synagogue attacked, and Jewish businesses and synagogues targeted.

And now, we have this tragic murder of two innocent young people in the prime of their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and the entire Jewish community at this difficult time.

It's time for all Americans to come together to say that antisemitism has no place in our country, and for all of our leaders to work together to root out this evil and hate.

Antisemitism was already at historic levels. ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s latest Audit of Antisemitic Incidents tracked a total of 9,354 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in 2024, an increase of 5 percent from the previous year and a 344 percent increase over the past five years. This is the highest number of attacks against Jews on record since ADL began tracking incidents 46 years ago.

According to data from the ADL Center on Extremism, since July 2024 there have been nine terrorist plots and attacks targeting Jews, Zionists or Jewish Institutions in the United States.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/independent-k-12-schools-failing-respond-antisemitism,"New York, NY, May 21, 2025, Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã‚Â Jewish families at independent K-12 schools are facing many challenges related to antisemitism and ongoing institutional shortcomings in addressing these issues, according to new research from the ADL Ratings and Assessments Institute (RAI) and the Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE). To address the failures of many independent K-12 schools to address antisemitism, ADL is launching a new initiative to support and empower parents and to hold independent schools accountable.

This initiative will expand access to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s growing suite of parent advocacy resources, ensuring parents have the information they need to urge their schools to take action and adopt best practices. ADL is also expanding its partnership with Jewish Leaders in Schools (JLIS), a no-cost, ADL-supported network that turns parents into powerful advocates. With expert one-on-one guidance and a proven framework, JLIS equips parents to fight antisemitism and partner effectively with schools to create lasting, positive change. Finally, ADL will offer free legal support through ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s K-12 Antisemitism Legal Line for Jewish families whose children have faced antisemitism.

""These independent schools are failing to support Jewish families. By tolerating -- or in some cases, propagating -- antisemitism in their classrooms, too many independent schools in cities across the country are sending a message that Jewish students are not welcome. It's wrong. It's hateful. And it must stop,"" said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœADL is partnering with parents to demand change.""

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s new report reveals the widespread problem in independent schools.Ã‚Â The research, which included a multi-state survey, as well as focus groups with parents of Jewish children in independent schools in metropolitan areas including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., found concern among parents about antisemitic symbols, as well as problematic curricula and classroom content related to Jews and Israel. Nearly one-third of surveyed parents said they identified problematic curricula since October 7, 2023, and even more parents reported that their children experienced or witnessed at least one form of antisemitism.

The prevalence of antisemitism contributes to a culture where some Jewish children feel uncomfortable expressing their identity in school. One parent told ADL researchers,Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Âœ[My child] has a Jewish star necklace. He doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t wear it at school.""

Many schools appear reluctant to address antisemitism, often downplaying parentsÃ¢Â€Â™ concerns. Parents described school leaders who lead them to believe they were alone in raising concerns about antisemitism, despite evidence to the contrary. Many Jewish families feel pushed to the margins in independent K-12 schools and some are considering leaving. One parent said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe recently pulled both our kidsÃ¢Â€Â¦ after several antisemitic incidents went unaddressed.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœSchool administrators and faculty have a duty to ensure safe, inclusive environments for all,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â said Shira Goodman, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Vice President of Advocacy who oversees both RAI and CCAE. Ã¢Â€ÂœADL will fully invest in bolstering the families who are demanding that their schools meet this obligation.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/under-radar-militias-use-new-terminology-hide-plain-sight,"Across the United States, militia groups are redefining how they identify themselves and each other, signaling a broader effort to soften their image and manipulate public perception. Research by the ADL Center on Extremism over the past year into many new militia groups shows they have eschewed the traditional Ã¢Â€ÂœmilitiaÃ¢Â€Â moniker, especially those with younger members. While many groups continue to explicitly call themselves militias, others have embraced a new nomenclature and are using names such as Ã¢Â€Âœmutual assistance groupÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœcontingency group.Ã¢Â€Â

These militia groups, like their older counterparts, still espouse an anti-government ideology with an emphasis on paramilitary training. While this rhetorical shift may seem cosmetic, the adoption of these new terms allows militia groups to camouflage their extremist ideology, sidestep public scrutiny and grow their networks both online and offline.

The Problem with Ã¢Â€ÂœMilitiaÃ¢Â€Â

Since the 1990s, groups have used the Ã¢Â€ÂœmilitiaÃ¢Â€Â moniker to signal their participation in a movement that embraces an anti-government,Ã‚Â conspiracy-oriented ideology and stresses armed paramilitary training. However, over the course of the movement's history, federal and state authorities have convicted many militia group members for a wide range ofÃ‚Â criminal activities, from amassing illegal arsenals to violent plots and attacks. The extreme acts of many of its members forever tarnished the reputation of the militia movement.

The movementÃ¢Â€Â™s negative image has also hampered the efforts of militia groups to build inroads with local communities because most community members have typically rejected them. Bob Herget, a leader of the York County Poquoson Community Mission in Virginia, has claimed that his local sheriff advised him to abandon the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s former name, Ã¢Â€ÂœYork County Poquoson Constitutional Militia,Ã¢Â€Â allegedly anticipating that the community would have a problem with the word Ã¢Â€Âœmilitia.Ã¢Â€Â Similarly, in the fall of 2024, a chapter leader of the Yellowstone MilitiaÃ¢Â€Â”a Billings, Montana-based Ã‚Â Three PercenterÃ‚Â  militia groupÃ¢Â€Â”stated to county commissioners during aÃ‚Â meeting in which they volunteered to provide community Ã¢Â€ÂœprotectionÃ¢Â€Â that they Ã¢Â€Âœare not the bad militia that people. . . ha[ve] made it out to beÃ¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  and that there is an Ã¢Â€Âœunfortunate history of the word militia.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

These emerging names havenÃ¢Â€Â™t just impacted the public perception of the movement, they have also affected their online organizing. In August 2020, FacebookÃ¢Â€Â”at the time, one of the primary organizing hubs for the militia movementÃ¢Â€Â”announced that it was removing militia groups along withÃ‚Â QAnon spaces from its platform because of their widespread violent rhetoric and celebration of violent acts that occurred during theÃ‚Â George Floyd protests taking place across the U.S. at the time. This move greatly impeded the ability of militia groups to operate online.

The adoption of new terminology allows militias toÃ‚Â evade content moderation and create new safe havens on mainstream social media to promote their anti-government ideology, grow their network and translate online activities into real-world action.Ã‚Â As a result, these militias have attracted hundredsÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â” and at times thousands Ã¢Â€Â” of followers on their accounts.

This access to mainstream social media platforms has allowed militias to gain visibility among mainstream audiences. For example, many of these militias are operating on Instagram, where theyÃ‚Â interact on posts detailing training exercises and recruitment efforts, often showcasing joint paramilitary training with other militia groups they connect with on the platform.

The Virginia-based Central Virginia Irregulars (CVI) militiaÃ¢Â€Â”which was founded in 2023 and also calls itself a Ã¢Â€Âœmutual assistance groupÃ¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Â”exemplifies this trend. In an April 2025 Instagram post, CVI tagged and urged militia groups to connect with potential recruits as they claimed to have received an influx of Ã¢Â€Âœgroup informationÃ¢Â€Â requests. The post received comments from at least 10 other militia groups.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

Their tagging efforts in the post are part of a broader strategy on the platform to gain the attention of other militia groups both regionally and nationally. This drives engagement on their account and creates a ripple effect where militia groups will endorse each other and further spread their content on mainstream platforms.

New Names

While a number of militia groups continue to call themselves Ã¢Â€ÂœmilitiaÃ¢Â€Â or use other historical names like Ã¢Â€ÂœminutemenÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœirregulars,Ã¢Â€Â many of the names of newer, emerging militia groups, such as Ã¢Â€Âœmutual assistance groups,Ã¢Â€Â areÃ‚Â adopted from theÃ‚Â prepper/survivalist community. Historically, there has been a crossover between the militia movement and the survivalist community. By adopting names tied to these communities, militia groups attempt to appear benign, blend into more mainstream currents, and attract potential recruits. New militia groups have opted for many different names, with the most popular self-descriptions including:

Mutual Assistance Group (MAG)
Reconnaissance Group
Contingency Group
Guerrilla Group
Civil Training Group
Ã¢Â€ÂœPrepared CitizenÃ¢Â€Â Group
Ã¢Â€ÂœVolunteerÃ¢Â€Â Group

These new names enable these militia groups to continue their old patterns of conducting organized paramilitary training and promote the same anti-government beliefs that have resulted in violence in the past.",[6],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH

(NASDAQ: GOOG)(the Ã¢Â€ÂœCompanyÃ¢Â€Â) to vote AGAINST a shareholder proposal designed to harm Israel by pressuring the Company into severing business ties with the country.Ã‚Â 

ADL and JLens noted thatÃ‚Â Proposal 9 is expected to be submitted to a shareholder vote at the Alphabet annual meeting on June 6, 2025. The proposal cites the fact that Alphabet provides cloud-computing technology to Ã¢Â€ÂœProject Nimbus,Ã¢Â€Â a system used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and many civilian applications, as justification for a request that the Company commission an independent third-party report to determine whether its customersÃ¢Â€Â™ use of certain products and services, Ã¢Â€Âœcontributes to human rights harms in conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRA).Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

The Board of Directors of Alphabet has recommended that their shareholders vote AGAINST the above-noted shareholder proposal.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœProposal 9 offers the pretense of concern for human rights when in fact it is a thinly disguised ploy to weaken IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s national securityÃ¢Â€Â”and to undermine its right to defend itselfÃ¢Â€Â”by pressuring Alphabet to withhold vital technology that supports the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s self-defense capabilities,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of ADL. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe believe this proposal is closely aligned with the objectives of theÃ‚Â Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, whose goal is to delegitimize the State of Israel.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

ADL and JLens believe that Proposal 9 misrepresents Ã¢Â€ÂœProject NimbusÃ¢Â€Â by portraying it solely as a military initiative, while ignoring its broad civilian applications across IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s ministries of finance, healthcare, education, and transportation. At the same time, the proposal disregards the urgent and lawful need for modern defense technologiesÃ¢Â€Â”especially in the wake of the October 7, 2023 terror attacks, which killed over 1,200 people and took hundreds hostage. AlphabetÃ¢Â€Â™s cloud services play a vital role in both safeguarding Israeli civilians and strengthening essential public infrastructure, making this proposal not only misleading but dangerously out of touch with the realities on the ground.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœAlphabetÃ¢Â€Â™s shareholders should see this proposal for what it is: an attempt to misuse the proxy process to advance a divisive political agenda that has no place in corporate governance,Ã¢Â€Â said Ari Hoffnung, Managing Director of JLens. Ã¢Â€ÂœProposal 9 not only distorts the purpose of Project NimbusÃ¢Â€Â”it also risks undermining shareholder value by inserting geopolitics into decisions about lawful, commercially sound partnerships.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

The shareholder proposal is not the first time Alphabet has come under attack from anti-Israel activists, but rather part of a broader campaign targeting Google for its business ties with Israel. In April 2024,Ã‚Â Google terminated 28 employees following a series of protests against its cloud contract with the Israeli government, citing workplace disruptions and policy violations, according to an internal memo. BDS movement organizers also condemned the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s 2025 acquisition of Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz, claiming it reflects support for the so-called Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraeli apartheid system.Ã¢Â€Â In one extreme case, protesters targeted the home of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, hanging banners that labeled him a Ã¢Â€Âœgenocide profiteer.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

JLens has filed a Notice of Exempt Solicitation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, describing its opposition to Alphabet shareholder proposal.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/audit-antisemitic-incidents-2024,"Executive Summary
Each year, ADL (Anti-Defamation League) tracks incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault in the United States. Since 1979, we have published this information in an annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents.
In 2024, ADL tabulated 9,354 antisemitic incidents across the United States. This represents a 5% increase from the 8,873 incidents recorded in 2023, a 344% increase over the past five years and a 893% increase over the past 10 years. It is the highest number on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents 46 years ago.
Incidents of vandalism and assault increased significantly in 2024. Assaults increased by 21% to 196 incidents, impacting 250 victims, and vandalism increased by 20% to 2,606 incidents. Harassment incidents remained relatively steady, with an increase of 0.26%, for a total of 6,552 incidents.
For the first time in the history of the Audit, a majority (58%) of all incidents contained elements related to Israel or Zionism. A large portion of Israel-related antisemitic incidents occurred at or in the vicinity of anti-Israel protests. Out of over 5,000 anti-Israel rallies tracked by ADL in 2024, 2,596 involved antisemitic messaging in the form of signs, chants or speeches.
Incidents on college and university campuses rose more steeply than those in any other location. In 2024, ADL recorded 1,694 antisemitic incidents on college campuses, which is 84% higher than in 2023. Campus incidents comprised 18% of all incidents, a larger proportion than in any previous Audit.
While incidents decreased by 14% at Jewish institutions, they remained elevated compared to pre-October 7, 2023, levels. Jewish organizations, particularly synagogues, were targeted with hundreds of bomb threats and hundreds more general antisemitic threats. Congregants were harassed and even assaulted while at or in the vicinity of Jewish institutions, and some anti-Israel groups escalated their tactics, protesting Jewish religious and cultural institutions on dozens of occasions.
Incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As in previous years, states and metropolitan areas with the largest Jewish populations continued to report the highest levels of incidents. The states with the highest levels of incidents were New York (1,437) and California (1,344).","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/nearly-five-fold-increase-antisemitic-harassment-facebook-directed-jewish,"New York, NY, May 8, 2025, Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã‚Â  Researchers at the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society (CTS)Ã‚Â found thatÃ‚Â Jewish Members of Congress have experienced a nearly five-fold increase in antisemitic harassment on Facebook since Meta rolled back its moderation policy at the start of the year.Ã‚Â 

Following this policy shift, ADLÃ‚Â stated its deep concerns,Ã‚Â saying that this change would be a ""step backward"" and allow increased hate, antisemitism, and toxicity on Facebook and potentially its other platforms as well. To measure how much harmful content this policy change might allow through, ADL researchers collected and analyzed toxic and antisemitic comments directed at the 30 Jewish Members of Congress with Facebook accounts.

Key Findings from theÃ‚Â Research:

The average number of comments per day appears to have increased sharply (by a factor of eight) from February 4, 2025, including both hateful and non-hateful comments.
Until Feb. 4, there was an average of 6.5 antisemitic comments per day. They then spiked and remained much higher, to almost 30 per day through April 7).
This increase includes a nearly five-fold spike in antisemitic comments per day on the Facebook accounts of the 30 Jewish Members of Congress with Facebook accounts.
The proportions of antisemitic and toxic content remained relatively consistent, suggesting that Meta is dialing down all content moderation, allowing an increase in the total volume of toxic and hateful comments.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœMeta bears responsibility for the harm that its recent moderation policy roll-back has caused as it is enabling, if not actively encouraging, antisemitic, hateful, and toxic activity on its platforms,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœThis hate targeted at Jewish Members of Congress is not only unacceptable, but also a reflection of what all American Jews and regular users experience online daily across MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s social media platforms. The findings of this study reinforce our determination to request appropriate content moderation on MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s platforms and to work with all stakeholders to protect all online users from hate and harassment.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL previously found that the majority of Americans who experience online harassment are harassed on Facebook, 61 percent in the previous year, according toÃ‚Â CTSÃ¢Â€Â™s 2024 annual survey of online hate and harassment. Facebook is the most popular social media platform in the US by number of users; even still, the number of people who report harassment there is out of proportion to its popularity.

Moreover,Ã‚Â ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s latest social media scorecard released in September 2024, showed that Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram) responded to zero cases of antisemitic content when reported as average users. ADL andÃ‚Â othersÃ‚Â warned that dialing back content moderation efforts would allow toxic and hateful content to surge.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœRolling back content moderation practices means that toxicity and antisemitism are allowed to thrive even more than in the past,Ã¢Â€Â said Daniel Kelley, Director of Strategy and Operations, and Interim Head of the ADL Center for Technology and Society. Ã¢Â€ÂœADL research has consistently shown that marginalized groups are the most targeted with online identity-based harassment and that the consequence for regular users is too often to withdraw from these spaces. Meta should seriously reconsider this decision or find better ways to protect users, especially those routinely targeted with hate.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Methodology

ADL researchers collected 337,763 comments from the Facebook pages of the 30 self-identified Jewish Members of Congress with Facebook accounts between January 1 and April 7, 2025 (one additional member of Congress with a Facebook account was not included because the account was created only recently). ADL then analyzed these comments using ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s own antisemitism classifier to rate the likelihood of antisemitic content in each comment and a toxicity classifier (Google JigsawÃ¢Â€Â™s Perspective API). More details about the methodology are available in the report.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/80-years-after-wwii-seven-largest-jewish-communities-report-unprecedented,"Berlin, Germany, May 7, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â¦ As the world commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the J7 Large CommunitiesÃ¢Â€Â™ Task Force Against Antisemitism released its inaugural J7 Annual Report on Antisemitism, documenting sharp increases in antisemitic incidents in the seven largest Jewish communities outside of Israel.

The report highlights dramatic rises in both the total number of antisemitic incidents and antisemitic incidents per capita inÃ¢Â€Â”Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United StatesÃ¢Â€Â”driven in part by the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist massacre in Israel. The findings were unveiled today at a press conference in Berlin, Germany.

Ã¢Â€ÂœMeeting in Berlin today, I'm struck by both history's weight and our communities' resilience,Ã¢Â€Â said Marina Rosenberg, ADL Senior Vice President of International Affairs. Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœSince Oct. 7, 2023 antisemitism has risen to unprecedented levels in societies where the majority of Jews live in the diaspora. In response to these findings, the J7 Task Force is calling on all countries to adopt and implement the Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism. These guidelines will help to support governments, institutions, and civil society partners in developing practical policies to ensure the safety, inclusion, and dignity of Jewish communities worldwide.Ã¢Â€Â

In 2024, Australia reported a staggering 317% increase in antisemitic incidents, while the United States saw a 5% rise, reflecting the enduring impact of October 7. Additionally, preliminary data from J7 members including Canada and Germany indicate that antisemitic incidents have either continued to rise or remained at historically high levels.

From 2021 to 2023, antisemitic incidents spiked by 11% in Australia, 23% in Argentina, 72% in Germany, 83% in Canada, 90% in the UK, 185% in France, and 227% in the US.

Antisemitic incidents in each J7 country by year.

Year-on-year percentage increase in antisemitic incidents in each J7 country.

The rate of antisemitic incidents per Jewish capita has reached alarming levels, underscoring the increased vulnerability of Jewish communities globally. In Germany, there were more than 38 antisemitic incidents for every 1,000 Jewish residents in 2023. The U.K. followed with over 13 incidents per 1,000 Jewish residents.

This report also identifies several common trends across J7 countries: a rise in violent antisemitic incidents, repeated targeting of Jewish institutions including synagogues, schools, and community centers; an escalation of online hate; growing insecurity leading some Jews to hide their identity; and government failure to hold accountable those who engage in antisemitic violence or support terrorism against the Jewish state.Ã‚Â 

Leaders of the J7 Task Force communities shared their perspectives on this troubling global surge of antisemitism:

Argentina - Mauro Berenstein, President, DAIA:Ã‚Â ""In Argentina, we see with concern the exponential rise of antisemitism, in educational, academic, and professional settings, where many people, under the guise of critical thinking or a just cause, reproduce age-old prejudices. Social media has amplified these narratives. What was once whispered now goes viral in seconds. Therefore, more than ever, memory and education are not just tools of the past: they are a duty of the present and a hope for the future.""

Australia Ã¢Â€Â“ Alex Ryvchin, Co-CEO, Executive Council of Australian Jewry: Ã¢Â€ÂœThis report presents the most comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon of antisemitism in the western world since October 7. All of our communities have been afflicted by this, but the situation in Australia presents a particularly staggering depiction of how healthy multicultural societies can be captured by networks of extremists who succeed in fundamentally altering relations between Jews and non-Jews and causing the Jewish community to question its future in a country where its roots are deep and its contributions have been profound. The Australian experience also illustrates that when antisemitism is not met with sufficient force of policing, law and political leadership, it can escalate into devastating violence and can attract the most vicious elements of society ranging from religious and ideological fanatics to organised crime. The importance and value of this report is a testament to the work of the ADL in convening the J7 and the outstanding cooperation between its member communities.Ã¢Â€Â

Canada - Noah Shack, Interim President, CIJA:Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœSince October 7, Canada has experienced a wave of antisemitic attacks Ã¢Â€Â” with Jewish schools shot at, synagogues firebombed, Jewish-owned businesses vandalized, and neighbourhoods targeted. The challenges facing Canada's Jewish community are immense. In the wake of last week's federal election, we have a clear expectation that the next Parliament will move urgently to advance serious and impactful solutions to combat hate and protect Jewish Canadians. What is at stake is not only the safety and well-being of our community, but the future of a Canada where everyone can live free from fear and discrimination.Ã¢Â€Â

France - Yonathan Arfi, President, CRIF:Ã‚Â ""As President of the CRIF, I stand alongside our J7 partners in sounding the alarm over the disturbing surge in antisemitism that has swept through France since the atrocities of October 7. What we are witnessing is not just a statistical increase, it is a societal warning sign. This is not a crisis for the Jewish community, it is a test for our democracies. The escalation in hate speech, threats, and physical assaults against Jews around the world reminds us why international cooperation, like that of the J7, is more vital than ever.""

Germany - Dr. Josef Schuster, President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany: Ã¢Â€ÂœOctober 7, 2023 has massively accelerated a development that was already looming. Jews in Germany are under threat. A front has formed, cutting across the left and right, from Islamists to the very center of society. This coalition questions the self-evidence of todayÃ¢Â€Â™s Jewish life as well as GermanyÃ¢Â€Â™s culture of remembrance. These developments are overlapping and mutually influencing online and offline. We are seeing similar developments in all the J7 countries and I am glad that this strong task force exists. As we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, it is a great honor for the Central Council to welcome the J7 representatives to Berlin and share our work with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others.Ã¢Â€Â

United Kingdom Ã¢Â€Â“ Phil Rosenberg, President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews:Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœWe at the Board of Deputies of British Jews are proud to have worked with our J7 Partners on this collective report looking at antisemitic trends across our countries. The sharp rise in antisemitic attacks that we all saw following the 7th October massacres, and the subsequent trends since then, are living proof of the value that the J7 brings to Jewish communities around the world. We must insist on zero tolerance of antisemitism and ensure that this message gets through to lawmakers wherever we live.""

United States - Betsy Berns-Korn, Chair-Elect of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations:Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœEighty years after the end of World War II, Jewish leaders from across the world have come together to reaffirm a simple truth: that we will never allow hatred to define our future. Rooted in memory, guided by justice, and strengthened by unity, we reaffirm our commitment to securing a safer and more inclusive world for generations to come.Ã‚Â  This inaugural report reflects the strength of our collective voice and unwavering resolve.""

The J7, theÃ‚Â Large CommunitiesÃ¢Â€Â™ Task Force Against Antisemitism, was formed in response to increasing rates of antisemitism around the world and comprises Jewish organizations in the Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/white-supremacists-help-raise-hundreds-thousands-woman-who-hurled-slur-black,"Over the last week, white supremacists, antisemites and racists have been supporting a woman accused of calling a Black child a racial slur by helping to coordinate her donation drive and raising hundreds of thousands of dollars. They have leveraged the fundraising campaign to spread hateful talking points and legitimize their ideas.

The woman, identified in media reports as Shiloh Hendrix, was depicted in a video that began circulating on social media on April 28, 2025, allegedly accosting a Black five-year-old at a playground in Rochester, Minnesota. In the video, the man recording asks the woman if she called the child a n***er, and she responds by hurling the slur at the man recording as well.

On May 1, 2025, a crowdfunding campaign was created on GiveSendGoÃ¢Â€Â”a prominent facilitator of extremist crowdfundingÃ¢Â€Â”to raise funds for Hendrix. It is unclear who was authentically involved in creating the campaign, although several X users known to promote extremist and anti-Black rhetoric have since claimed shared responsibility for coordinating the effort. They assert that Hendrix will be the primary recipient of the funds, and the GiveSendGo campaign page indicates this is the case.

The GiveSendGo campaign immediately went viral on X, and the link to the page was mentioned over 25,000 times in the days that followed the circulation of the video. As of this writing, the campaign has received over $700,000 of its $1,000,000 goal from over 26,500 donors, with many of the donation comments containing white supremacist, racist and antisemitic messaging, names and denominations.

White Supremacist Donations Filled with Hate

A COE review of 23,409 donations (as of May 4, 2025, at 1:45 pm EDT) for the GiveSendGo campaign found that 13,031 (or 56%) of donations included a comment and/or a name (the remaining contributors left the space for this information blank). Further review of the donations with a comment and/or name found that 3,935 (roughly 30%) included white supremacist, racist or antisemitic content.

The comments and donation names included a wide variety of racial slurs against Black people, white supremacist and Nazi symbols, and calls for the killing or deportation of non-whites and Jews. Dozens used their donation comment to leverage antisemitic conspiracy theories. Such messages included:Ã‚Â  ""J3ws are the reason we are in this mess,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœJews have been flooding our countries with the bioweapons for centuries,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœJews are using diverse immigrants to dilute the white populationÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœThe goyim are figuring out Jews are using non-whites to wage their ancient war against God.""

Soon, the number of hateful comments ballooned and GiveSendGo disabled the ability to leave comments with donations, though the platform notably did not shut down the campaign itself. After comments were disabled, donors exploited the name field to continue to spread their hatred. Fourteen of the top 20 most repeated donor names include white supremacist or racist references, including the spoonerism Ã¢Â€ÂœNate HiggersÃ¢Â€Â (130 times), Ã¢Â€Âœwhite lives matterÃ¢Â€Â (24), and Ã¢Â€ÂœTNDÃ¢Â€Â [Total N***er Death] (19).

Donations were also made in denominations of white supremacist numerical codes such as 14 and 88. At the time of this report, there were 693 donations of $14, 99 donations of $88, and 26 donations that used variations of 1488.

After GiveSendGo disabled comments on the Hendrix campaign, white supremacists continued to use the name and alias fields to spread their vitriol. (Screenshot/GiveSendGo)Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

White Supremacists Organize Donations

From the start, the campaign to raise money for Hendrix has been promoted by white supremacist X users. One user, who identifies himself as Ã¢Â€ÂœOrganizer & Admin for the Shiloh Hendrix campaignÃ¢Â€Â in his X bio, has a history of espousing extremist tropes and racist rhetoric, including conspiracy theories about Ã¢Â€Âœwhite replacementÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœwhite genocide.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Other white supremacist users promoting the campaign have claimed to be in contact with Hendrix herself and clarified that she would be receiving all of the money.

White supremacists are using the Hendrix incident, coupled with the April 2025 fatal stabbing of a white teen, Austin Metcalf in Frisco, Texas, to promote the false Black-on-white crime narrative that Black people are inherently violent and are a threat to white people. This narrative has been a major driver for donations to the Hendrix campaign, with white supremacists pushing supporters to her campaign in a bid to outraise another GiveSendGo campaign, one benefiting Karmelo Anthony, the Black teen accused of stabbing Metcalf. Hundreds of comments on the Hendrix campaign page reference Metcalf or Anthony.

On X, white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes referred to the Hendrix fundraiser as Ã¢Â€Âœa middle fingerÃ¢Â€Â to certain Black people, including Anthony, concluding that Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite people have had enough.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Several prominent white supremacist influencers and groups appear to have donated to the Hendrix fundraising campaign, using the campaign to promote themselves and their groups. Prominent white supremacist influencer Paul Miller AKA Gypsy Crusader, appears to have donated $50 to Hendrix, calling her a Ã¢Â€Âœbased queen.Ã¢Â€Â Alleged organizers of the campaign have named Miller as one of the individuals Ã¢Â€Âœdirectly involved in running & administeringÃ¢Â€Â the crowdfunding effort.Ã‚Â  Miller claimed on X that he was Ã¢Â€Âœvery proud to be part of it.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Chris Pohlhaus, the founder and leader of Blood Tribe, appears to have donated $20. White supremacist Ryan J. Murdough of the New England White Network (NEWN) also appears to have donated at least $75, writing, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou have support from all over the nation. Please consider moving to New England. You have a pre existing [sic] network of racially aware White [sic] families already here waiting for you,Ã¢Â€Â along with links to his Gab account. An individual promoting the white supremacist group Hate Club donated $20 and included the 14 Words in their message. Similarly, a user promoting the American Blackshirts Movement (ABM) donated $14, urging viewers to join ABM and Ã¢Â€Âœforget white guilt.Ã¢Â€Â The Pennsylvania chapter of White Lives Matter (WLM) appears to have donated $14 and included a link to the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s Telegram channel.

Several donors promoted the antisemitic Goyim Defense League (GDL), with one large $1,488 donation calling Black people Ã¢Â€ÂœsavagesÃ¢Â€Â and including a Ã¢Â€ÂœshoutoutÃ¢Â€Â to GoyimTV, the networkÃ¢Â€Â™s video streaming service. Many of the donations included links to GDL websites. A well-known affiliate of the network appears to have donated $14 to Hendrix, thanking her for Ã¢Â€Âœcalling out these j*wish [sic] funded 3rd world bioweapons,Ã¢Â€Â along with a link to the networkÃ¢Â€Â™s propaganda website.

Various Active Clubs also ostensibly donated to the campaign, also using it to promote themselves. Palmetto Active Club (SC) appears to have donated $60, and Tribal Active Club, (AZ) Wyoming Active Club and Great Plains Active Club appear to have donated $20 each.

The prominentÃ‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœWestern ChauvinistÃ¢Â€Â Telegram channel, affiliated with the Proud Boys, made and forwarded several posts supporting Hendrix, with one reading, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite guilt is over.Ã‚Â  We have officially destroyed it.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  The same post was shared by the white supremacistÃ‚Â Atlantic Nationalist Club (ANC). An X account affiliated with the white supremacist group Blood Tribe made a repost to the platform praising Hendrix that linked to the GiveSendGo campaign.

On the Ground Impact

Beyond providing online and financial support, white supremacists have demonstrated their backing for Hendrix in the physical world. For example, during a May 3 demonstration in Toronto, Canada, a group of white supremacistsÃ¢Â€Â”including individuals associated with Nationalist 13 and severalÃ‚Â Active ClubsÃ¢Â€Â”chanted, Ã¢Â€ÂœShiloh Hendrix did nothing wrong.Ã¢Â€Â

Several white supremacist groups also distributed propaganda related to the incident. The white supremacist National Organization for Vital Action (NOVA) placed several stickers at the Rochester, Minnesota, playground where the incident took place, with one sticker reading, Ã¢Â€ÂœAccess to whites is not a human right,Ã¢Â€Â and another reading, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite unity.Ã¢Â€Â A Midwest-based Active Club also made a post showing the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s stickers in Rochester.Ã‚Â American Freedom Party (AFP) posted stickers with HendrixÃ¢Â€Â™s face and the caption, Ã¢Â€ÂœStand against anti-White terror campaigns,Ã¢Â€Â at unknown locations in central Massachusetts.","[1, 2, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/metas-hate-policy-rollback-linked-increased-antisemitism,"Introduction

Jewish members of Congress have experienced a nearly fivefold increase in antisemitic harassment on Facebook since the start of the year, according to new ADL research. ADL believes this is due to a highly controversial change to Meta's content moderation policies for its platforms in January 2025.

Because of the change to the policies that govern what users are allowed to say and do on MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s platformsÃ¢Â€Â”Instagram, Facebook and ThreadsÃ¢Â€Â”Meta now relies on user reporting to identify much of the hateful, Ã¢Â€Âœlawful but awfulÃ¢Â€Â speech, instead of proactively removing it without a user report.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is a trade-off,Ã¢Â€Â Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time the change was announced in January 2025. Ã¢Â€ÂœIt means that weÃ¢Â€Â™re going to catch less bad stuff, but weÃ¢Â€Â™ll also reduce the number of innocent peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down.Ã¢Â€Â

Following this dramatic policy shift, ADL expressed deep concern, warning that this change would be a Ã¢Â€Âœstep backward.Ã¢Â€Â ADL and others further cautioned that dialing back content moderation efforts would allow toxic and hateful content to surge.",[6],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.8}",MEDIUM

Antisemitism on college campuses is a serious crisis. Over the past year, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen hate-fueledÃ‚Â rhetoric and protests that have crossed the line into harassment, intimidation, and even violence. Jewish students deserve the same protections and sense of safety as all students Ã¢Â€Â” and too often, that standard is not being met.

We welcome this hearing and thank Chairman Walberg and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce for continuing to shine a spotlight on campus antisemitism. Congressional oversight and bipartisan action are critical to ensuring that schools uphold their legal and moral responsibilities under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

At ADL, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve worked directly with university leaders to push for real solutions: antisemitism education, stronger bias response protocols, and consistent enforcement of campus policies. Our Campus Antisemitism Report CardÃ‚Â evaluates how colleges and universities Ã¢Â€Â” including Cal Poly, Haverford, and DePaul Ã¢Â€Â” are responding to this crisis. All three schools earned a D or F. That is unacceptable.

Since the report cardÃ¢Â€Â™s release, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen some signs of progress, including new policies and commitments from several institutions Ã¢Â€Â” including some ofÃ‚Â those testifying tomorrow. We are proud to have helped drive meaningful change through direct engagement, public accountability, and transparency.

But as tomorrowÃ¢Â€Â™s hearing will make clear, the work is far from done. Jewish students are still being targeted, and many institutions are still failing to meetÃ‚Â the moment. We hope to hear a real commitment from Cal Poly, Haverford, and DePaulÃ‚Â to ensure their policies and procedures protect Jewish students and donÃ¢Â€Â™t trample on their or others' civil rights.

WeÃ¢Â€Â™ll be watching this hearing closely Ã¢Â€Â” and weÃ¢Â€Â™ll continue working with Congress, campus leaders, and students until every college is a place where Jewish students are safe, respected, included, and free to learn without fear.


The hearing will begin on May 7th at 10:15 AM ET and can be viewed on YouTube.Ã‚Â

(Ã¢Â€ÂœGlass LewisÃ¢Â€Â), to recommend that investors vote AGAINST anti-Israel shareholder proposals at the upcoming annual meetings of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT).

ADL and its Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) affiliate, JLens, previously called upon the shareholders of all three companies to reject the anti-Israel proposals, which will be voted on at their respective annual meetings to be held later this week.

At Intel, Proposal 5 urges the Board of Directors to conduct an Ethical Impact Assessment addressing the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s business operations in Israel. The proposal cites allegations that, among other things, Israel has committed human rights violations. The Intel annual meeting will be held on May 6, 2025.

General DynamicsÃ¢Â€Â™ shareholders have been asked to vote on Proposal 4, which cites the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s sales of arms to Israel as a reason that it believes the company should conduct a Human Rights Impact Assessment. The General Dynamics annual meeting will be held on May 7, 2025.

At Lockheed Martin, Proposal 5 is critical of the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s sale of military equipment and systems to Israel, and asks its Board of Directors to evaluate and report on the alignment of its political activities with its human rights policy, ostensibly implying that they are not consistent. Lockheed MartinÃ¢Â€Â™s annual meeting will be held on May 9, 2025.

ADL noted that the Boards of Directors of Intel, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin have recommended that their respective shareholders vote AGAINST the above-noted shareholder proposals.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are pleased that both ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended voting AGAINST the sham shareholder proposals at Intel, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of ADL. Ã¢Â€ÂœUnder the guise of an alleged concern for human rights, all three proposals are actually designed to pressure these corporations into severing ties with Israel and, ultimately, to delegitimize the Jewish state Ã¢Â€Â“ a major objective of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœThese proposals are part of a broader campaign to weaponize shareholder activism against Israel,Ã¢Â€Â said Ari Hoffnung, Managing Director of JLens. Ã¢Â€ÂœThey are not serious efforts to improve corporate governance or protect human rights Ã¢Â€Â” they are politically motivated attacks targeting the Jewish state. We commend ISS and Glass Lewis for seeing through the faÃƒÂ§ade and we urge shareholders to join us in rejecting these meritless, biased resolutions.Ã¢Â€Â

JLens has filed separate Notices of Exempt Solicitation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, describing its opposition to the Intel, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin shareholder proposals.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/masar-badil-what-you-need-know,"Masar Badil, also known as the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement, is a transnational extreme anti-Zionist organization. Its activities include co-hosting events and rallies with the terror-connected and fellow extreme anti-Zionist organizationÃ‚Â Samidoun, publishing inflammatory statements that glorify violence against the State of Israel and Zionists and hosting webinars featuringÃ‚Â members of U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) Hamas and Ansar Allah (the Houthis).

Masar Badil is closely associated and shares some of its leadership with Samidoun, which was sanctioned in October 2024 by the U.S. and Canadian governments as a Ã¢Â€Âœsham charityÃ¢Â€Â and international fundraiser for the U.S.-designated terrorist group theÃ‚Â Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The most prominent of these leaders is Khaled Barakat, who was personallyÃ‚Â sanctioned by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as a Specially Designated National (SDN)Ã‚Â for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf, directly or indirectly, of the PFLP.

Ã‚Â 

In addition to Barakat, members of Masar BadilÃ¢Â€Â™s executive committee include Jaldia Abubakra, a Samidoun activist located in Spain, and Mohammed Khatib, the Belgium-based Europe coordinator of Samidoun, who was described as an Ã¢Â€Âœextremist hate preacherÃ¢Â€Â by the Belgian secretary of state for asylum and migration in April 2024.

Ã‚Â 

SamidounÃ¢Â€Â™s Canada-based international coordinator and BarakatÃ¢Â€Â™s spouse, Charlotte Kates,Ã‚Â is also closely connected with Masar Badil. Kates is the owner and registered contact for Masar BadilÃ¢Â€Â™s website, which hosted a donation page until 2024. Before being listed as a terror entity, Samidoun operated as a registered non-profit organization in Vancouver, Canada, where Kates resides. Samidoun previously accepted donations on behalf of Masar Badil for several of its conferences.

Kates also often co-hosts Masar BadilÃ¢Â€Â™s webinars, where terror figures have been interviewed. Samidoun regularly shares Masar Badil events on its own social media channels and the two groups frequently coordinate both online and in-person.

Masar Badil officiallyÃ‚Â launched in November 2021, following an initial call to organize by Barakat a month earlier. The organization released a statement describing itself as a Ã¢Â€Âœradical popular political movement established by Palestinian, Arab and international will Ã¢Â€Â¦ to be a framework and a popular resistance movement confronting Zionist colonialismÃ¢Â€Â¦Ã¢Â€Â

This declaration also laid out Masar BadilÃ¢Â€Â™s positions, including its commitment to support youth and student movements and womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movements in the Palestinian diaspora; Ã¢Â€Âœbring downÃ¢Â€Â the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), which it deems as Ã¢Â€Âœan agent of Zionist colonialismÃ¢Â€Â; a full political, social and economic boycott of Israel as part of itsÃ‚Â  anti-normalization philosophy; and Ã¢Â€Âœestablish a just and democratic society free of Zionism.Ã¢Â€Â

Platforming Members of Hamas and the Houthis

Masar BadilÃ¢Â€Â™s activities reveal the extreme nature of the group and its alignment with the so-called Ã¢Â€ÂœresistanceÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” a euphemistic reference to the various terrorist groups responsible for violent attacks against Israel. Since the Hamas-led terror massacre against Israel on October 7, 2023, Masar Badil has hosted webinars and online events with members of Hamas and the Yemen-based Houthis on ZoomÃ‚Â on multiple occasions and uploaded the videos to its now-inactiveÃ‚Â YouTube channel and Facebook account. Several of these videos have subsequently been removed by YouTube for violating itsÃ‚Â Terms of Service.

In a February 2024 online interview hosted by Kates and KhatibÃ¢Â€Â”Samidoun's Europe coordinator and Masar Badil Executive Committee memberÃ¢Â€Â”with senior Hamas leader Basem Naim, Khatib described the October 7 attack as a Ã¢Â€Âœholy day for us today.Ã¢Â€Â During the event, Masar Badil member Khaled al-Raheb asserted that Ã¢Â€Âœour role in the Masar [Badil] and organizations is to transfer the voice of the resistance to the world...Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri, who appeared in a September 2024 Masar Badil webinar hosted by Kates, Khatib and al-Raheb, referred to the group as Ã¢Â€ÂœfriendsÃ¢Â€Â and supporters. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe [Hamas] support the call for escalations and to the friends from Masar Badil, we appreciate their role and their effort to work on the streets to stand behind the Palestinian people, behind the Palestinian resistance,Ã¢Â€Â said Zuhri.

As host, Khatib referred to Zuhri as a Ã¢Â€Âœbrother and leader,Ã¢Â€Â praised the October 7, 2023, attack, and said he and other Palestinians have a responsibility Ã¢Â€Âœas activists that see ourselves as part of the Palestinian resistance and not supporters of the resistance.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Another Hamas leader, Osama Hamdan, who appeared in a Masar Badil webinar in May 2024 Ã¢Â€Â” this time hosted by Kates, Khatib and Abubakra Ã¢Â€Â” hailed the U.S. university encampments of the spring of 2024 as the Ã¢Â€Âœglobalized intifada led by university students,Ã¢Â€Â whom he called Ã¢Â€Âœheroes,Ã¢Â€Â adding that ""We [Hamas] appreciate this intifada.""

Masar Badil webinars have also sometimes included U.S.Ã¢Â€Â“based extreme anti-Zionist activists, such asÃ‚Â Nerdeen Kiswani of Within Our Lifetime (WOL).

Organized Events and Activities

In addition to webinars, Masar Badil has also hosted in-person anti-Zionist events and conferences in Brazil, Belgium, Canada, Lebanon, and other countries since its establishment in 2021.

Its launch conference that year took place across international venues in Beirut, Madrid, and SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, with attendees gathering concurrently in each city and connecting virtually. The launch conferenceÃ¢Â€Â™s planning committee included PFLP member Majed Dibsi, as well as Barakat and Abubakra.

Ã‚Â 

Samidoun claimed it sent some of its own members from all over the world, including ""Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, [and] Belgium."" Other represented anti-Zionist organizations included theÃ‚Â International League of PeopleÃ¢Â€Â™s Struggles (ILPS), the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network (IJAN), theÃ‚Â Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) andÃ‚Â Al-Awda.

The conference featured extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric and explicit support for terror group leaders. At various moments during the conference, participants chanted Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestine is Arab!Ã¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœThatÃ¢Â€Â™s how Ghassan [Kanafani] taught us, the target is everywhere!Ã¢Â€Â in reference to the former PFLP spokesperson. The conference also featured flags and T-shirts with the images of PFLP members Georges Abdallah and Ahmad SaÃ¢Â€Â™adat.

In April 2023, Masar Badil hosted a ""Liberation Conference""Ã‚Â in Ottawa, Canada, with endorsers that included radical anti-Zionist groups such asÃ‚Â Al-Awda,Ã‚Â Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), andÃ‚Â Within Our Lifetime (WOL). The Jewish anti-Zionist organizationÃ‚Â Neturei Karta was in attendance as well.

Ã‚Â 

Masar BadilÃ‚Â solicited U.S.-based donations to offset the costs of the conference viaÃ‚Â Samidoun fiscal sponsor the Alliance for Global Justice (AFJG), with instructions to indicate Ã¢Â€ÂœSamidounÃ¢Â€Â in the memo line. Canada-based donations were facilitated through a Canadian funds transfer service. Donations were similarly solicited for a 2022 Ã¢Â€ÂœMarch of Return and Liberation for PalestineÃ¢Â€Â in Belgium, organized jointly by Masar Badil and Samidoun.

Masar Badil claimed that Ã¢Â€Âœnearly 100 people representing 25 organizations, parties, associations and unionsÃ¢Â€Â participated in the 2023 conference in Ottawa, Ã¢Â€Âœwhich collectively declared the official launch of the Masar Badil movement in the United States and Canada.Ã¢Â€Â

This conference, too, featured inflammatory rhetoric, including expressions of support for U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations like Hamas, the PFLP and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and a call to Ã¢Â€Âœconfront Zionist colonialism, racism and settler colonialism in Palestine and North America.Ã¢Â€Â

A speech delivered by Barakat saluted ""Al Qassam [HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s military wing], Saraya al Jihad [sic] (likely meaning Saraya al-Quds - the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad), KataÃ¢Â€Â™ib Abu Ali Mustafa [the military wing of PFLP] and all of the Palestinian resistance factions who put their lives [sic] so we can live in a free world.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

In October 2024, on the first anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack, Masar Badil hosted a conference in Madrid titled Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Line of Resistance and Liberation: Towards Developing a Strategy for Resistance in the Diaspora.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  The event concluded with a rally in front of the U.S. embassy in Madrid. Abubakra highlighted the intentional choice of dates for the conference and rally, stating, Ã¢Â€ÂœIt was necessary for us to express our position in support of the Palestinian and Arab resistance in Gaza, Beirut, SanaÃ¢Â€Â™a and Baghdad, especially on the first anniversary of the glorious Al-Aqsa Flood [HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s monicker for their October 7 terrorist attack].Ã¢Â€Â

Messaging, Social Media and Reach

In addition to hosting in-person events and webinars, Masar Badil has a social media presence on X (formerly known as Twitter), Telegram, and Odysee, which the group uses to glorify terrorism. Statements expressing support for violence, encouraging chaos in the Palestinian diaspora and praising terrorist groups and their affiliated individuals are also regularly posted to Masar BadilÃ¢Â€Â™s website.

For example, in response to violent antisemitic attacks on Israelis in Amsterdam in November 2024, Masar Badil released a statement supportingÃ‚Â the violence Ã¢Â€Â” in which visiting Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv fans and others were brutally attacked in the streets Ã¢Â€Â” and calledÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Âœto confront every attempt to whitewash the crimes of the Zionist regime under the banner of Ã¢Â€Â˜sports.Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â

A month earlier, on the first anniversary of the October 7, 2023, attack, MasarÃ‚Â BadilÃ‚Â called forÃ‚Â days of rageÃ‚Â against the Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist massacres,Ã¢Â€Â in response to the call from Ã¢Â€Âœthe Resistance.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Abubakra emphasized that all must Ã¢Â€Âœexpress popular anger in the streets of Europe, North America, and Arab capitalsÃ‚Â against the Zionist movementÃ¢Â€Â¦Ã¢Â€Â

Masar Badil has alsoÃ‚Â amplified the anti-Israel campus movement in the spring and summer of 2024, sharing an appeal from the Palestinian student movement in Gaza calling for Ã¢Â€Âœrevolutionary escalation of the global student intifada for Palestine,Ã¢Â€Â and explicitly thankingÃ‚Â Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) for the anti-IsraelÃ‚Â encampments on university campuses. This statement aligns with Masar BadilÃ¢Â€Â™s goal of supporting the international Palestinian student movement. The organization called for Palestinian students to Ã¢Â€Âœstrengthen our common front against the organizations of the Zionist movement and its student branches around the worldÃ¢Â€Â as early as 2022.

Notably, the group released statements mourning the deaths of terrorist chiefs such as HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, and HezbollahÃ¢Â€Â™s Hassan Nasrallah, hailing them as great leaders and Ã¢Â€Âœmartyrs.Ã¢Â€Â The statement on NasrallahÃ¢Â€Â™s assassination ended with the words, Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath to the enemies and the racist Zionist entity, Victory to the resistance.Ã¢Â€Â

Masar BadilÃ¢Â€Â™s various statements have been shared by U.S.-based anti-Zionists on mainstream social media platforms. In March 2024, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)Ã¢Â€Â™s International Committee shared a statement on X from Masar Badil calling for Israel to be expelled from the United Nations. In another example, in March 2025, the University of WashingtonÃ¢Â€Â™s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter, SUPER (Students United for Palestinian Equality & Return) UW, linked out to a Masar Badil statement on Instagram that called for solidarity with Palestine, Yemen, and Lebanon against the Ã¢Â€ÂœUS-Zionist enemy.Ã¢Â€Â",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-welcomes-harvard-university-task-force-report-antisemitism,"New York, NY, April 30, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) welcomed theÃ‚Â findingsÃ‚Â of the Harvard Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias and commended the administration for finally prioritizing this issue.

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

For years, antisemitism has been a persistent, systemic challenge at so many colleges and universities, and it worsened exponentially in the wake of the brutal massacre in Israel on October 7,Ã‚Â 2023. And yet, perhaps no situation has been more shocking and scandalous than the mayhem at Harvard University. For that reason, we commend the clear-eyed and brutally honest assessment of the HarvardÃ‚Â Task Force on Combating Antisemitism.

The report released yesterday features truly stunning firsthand testimony from members of the Harvard community who experienced casual antisemitism, serial harassment and shocking violence. Each story is more appalling than the next. The report demolishes so many myths, such as the fantasy that antisemitism is not a serious problem on campus (it is); that calling for the destruction of the only Jewish country in the world is okay (it is not); and that anti-Jewish discrimination has not become embedded into the culture of certain fields of study (it has). Indeed, the report reveals that the crisis on campus was far more profound and far more serious than many even imagined. Credit goes to the brave Jewish and Israeli students who faced daily threats based on nothing other than their identities and yet persevered, every single day.

And yet, when you have a problem, the first step is to admit it.

For that reason, we appreciate the reportÃ¢Â€Â™s focus on accountability and the open acknowledgement of the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s many missteps; the identification of the various aspects of this problem, including through the voices of those who actually suffered; and the concrete recommendations to effectively protect Jewish students. Now, Harvard must take meaningful steps and meet the milestones outlined in its whole-of-campus approach to eliminating antisemitism.Ã‚Â 

ADL has been clear that the consistent and transparent enforcement of conduct rules is aÃ‚Â critical predicate to creating a safe and welcoming campus climate. We are pleased that President Garber has committed to producing data-driven reports about complaints of discrimination and harassment. This, along with a commitment to reviewing all disciplinary policies and procedures, will go a long way to repairing the climate and restoring a sense of safety for Jewish members of the Harvard community and, ultimately, all stakeholders in the institution.

To be clear, more work needs to be done. Questions must be answered about the radicalism in some academic departments at Harvard. And the university must resist the temptation to equivocate and suggest that there are somehow two sides to a one-sided situation wherein Jewish students continuously, indisputably have suffered from a pattern of violative actions. Nonetheless, this report represents an important and overdue step in the right direction and can start the healing process that is so desperately needed, not just on campus, but across the country.

We hope that Harvard will become a leader in creating a campus climate that is safe for all members of its community, particularly its Jewish students, and we will hold it accountable when it falls short.Ã‚Â We call on the Harvard president to follow the Task ForceÃ¢Â€Â™s recommendations and announce a robust set of actions.

The government also must continue to ensure HarvardÃ¢Â€Â™s implementation and continued progress meet the levels required by Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Jews deserve equal treatment on campus, nothing more and nothing less. And yet we hope that the federal government will appreciate the importance of this report and recognize results as they are achieved so that it can reinstitute federal funding and resume the provision of other services that have been halted. The abrupt termination of federal support is a drastic measure that imperils the entire institution and sets a fraught precedent; this is an ideal opportunity to step back from the brink and help Harvard and all of higher education to get it right.

In the end, ADL stands ready to assist Harvard as it works to fulfill its legal obligations and moral responsibilities and to help the university emerge as a model that, not only supports its Jewish community, but one that sets the standard for universities in America and beyond.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum exists to honor the memory of the six million Jews and millions of others murdered in the Holocaust and to educate current and future generations about the dangers of antisemitism and hate. It must remain above politics. Removing members of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council before the end of their terms risks politicizing a vital institution.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/american-blackshirts-movement-abm,"Key Points

The American Blackshirts Movement is a white supremacist group primarily active in Texas, Florida and Georgia, with a self-reported propaganda reach well beyond those states.
Named after the paramilitary wings of the Italian and British fascist parties of the 20th century, ABM advocates for Christian-based Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerican fascism.Ã¢Â€Â Like the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s namesake, the American Blackshirts Movement is also intensely anti-immigrant, antisemitic and anti-LGBTQ+.
Since officially forming in October 2023, the group has held numerous demonstrations and white supremacist propaganda distribution campaigns, which have mostly targeted the immigrant community.
ABM members have also engaged in Ã¢Â€Âœcombative training drillsÃ¢Â€Â and committed acts of vandalism, spray painting white supremacist phrases and symbols onto buildings.

Overview and Ideology

The American Blackshirts Movement (ABM) is a white supremacist group formed in October 2023. The ADL Center on Extremism (COE) has identified, with a high degree of confidence, Sean Salas of Allen, Texas, as a member of the group and likely its leader. ABM is primarily active in Texas, Florida and Georgia, and has alleged a propaganda reach far beyond those states.

Fascism is a central part of the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s ideology, with ABM drawing inspiration from the 20th century fascist Blackshirts of Italy and Great Britain. ABM is also explicitly anti-immigrant, antisemitic and anti-LGBTQ+.

ABM advocates for a modern, Christian Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerican fascismÃ¢Â€Â across the United States. The groupÃ¢Â€Â™s logo, a fasces embedded in a stump, is meant to symbolize chopping Ã¢Â€Âœthe tree of liberty back to its rootsÃ¢Â€Â to restore Ã¢Â€ÂœorderÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœunityÃ¢Â€Â through fascism.

Ã‚Â 

In an anonymous August 2024 interview hosted by an antisemitic influencer, an individual using the moniker Ã¢Â€ÂœBlackshirt SeanÃ¢Â€Â and identifying himself as the leader of ABM (likely Salas), argued that fascism in service of white supremacy is the only solution to combatting the perceived problems of multiculturalism, Judaism/Zionism, immigration and Ã¢Â€Âœcultural degeneracyÃ¢Â€Â in America.

The group idolizes Benito Mussolini and routinely recommends the Italian dictatorÃ¢Â€Â™s 1932 essay TheÃ‚Â Doctrine of Fascism to new recruits. In ABM spaces online, the group also regularly promotes the work of British fascist Oswald Mosely, the infamous antisemitic founder of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). A YouTube channel that appears to belong to Salas has posted six videos promoting fascist ideologies and movements, particularly in Chile (SalasÃ¢Â€Â™ father is of Chilean origin). COE linked the channel to Salas based on ABMÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â website domain registration and associated usernames.

ABM calls for the dismantling of democracy and claims that Republicans, along with Democrats, are too liberal. In a November 2023 Telegram post, Salas wrote, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf you vote for democracy, you are supporting the liberal institutions. This liberal institution is connected with big business (capitalism) and foreign interests (zionism) [sic].Ã¢Â€Â In another post to Telegram, the American Blackshirts shared a quote credited to an Italian protofascist who proclaimed that a Ã¢Â€Âœstate built on the basis of popular suffrage and equality in voting is not only ignoble, but precarious.Ã¢Â€Â

Anti-Immigration

Anti-immigration rhetoric is also central to ABMÃ¢Â€Â™s propaganda and demonstrations. Framing immigration as an Ã¢Â€Âœinvasion,Ã¢Â€Â the American Blackshirts claim that there is an ongoing Ã¢Â€ÂœgenocideÃ¢Â€Â of white Americans through immigration, espousing a version of the Great Replacement theory. In a March 2025 recruitment post on Telegram, the group wrote, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf you have any courage to stand up against White Replacement [sic], join the ABM.Ã¢Â€Â

On its website, ABM calls for a complete end to immigration and the Ã¢Â€ÂœmilitarizationÃ¢Â€Â of border security under fascist control using a border wall with Ã¢Â€Âœmachine gun nests.Ã¢Â€Â In a March 2025 post to Telegram, ABM claimed that Ã¢Â€Âœplenty of people in the Ã¢Â€Â˜broader [white supremacist] movementÃ¢Â€Â™ like to talk and rant against immigration to America, but even fewer groups have tackled the immigration problem like the ABM has.Ã¢Â€Â The post asserted that ABM does not Ã¢Â€Âœwant ANY immigration,Ã¢Â€Â and that people from India are Ã¢Â€Âœaliens who worship demons of rape and savagery and wish to replace us in every sector of life.Ã¢Â€Â

Since the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s foundation, a majority of ABMÃ¢Â€Â™s demonstrations have been primarily anti-immigrant. For example, in September 2024, individuals associated with the group hung a banner from overpasses in Dallas and Melissa, Texas, that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœOne nation for deportation,Ã¢Â€Â with a link to the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s Telegram channel.Ã‚Â That same month, individuals associated with the group distributed anti-immigrant propaganda across Jacksonville, Florida, and demonstrated on an overpass with banners that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœNo borders = weak nations,Ã¢Â€Â with a link to the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s Telegram channel, and Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite lives matter.Ã¢Â€Â In July 2024, the group hung a banner from an overpass in Houston, Texas, that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerica for Americans.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Antisemitism

ABM espouses hardline antisemitic views and directs much of its vitriol at Jewish people and perceived Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistÃ¢Â€Â control of American policy. Salas has claimed that he became a fascist and national socialist (Nazi) after Ã¢Â€ÂœlearningÃ¢Â€Â via 4chan that Ã¢Â€Âœthe Zionists, the Jews were running everything.Ã¢Â€Â ABM regularly publishes posts decrying perceived Zionist influence on American politics, arguing that democracy is an Ã¢Â€ÂœillnessÃ¢Â€Â innately tied to Zionism and supposedly under Jewish control. In a quote attributed to Mussolini, the group posted on Telegram in November 2023: Ã¢Â€ÂœAnti-Semitism is inevitable wherever Semitism becomes too powerful, too intrusive and too arrogant. The Jew himself is the cause of anti-Jewish sentiment.Ã¢Â€Â ABM has also burned copies of the Diary of Anne Frank.

Ã‚Â 

American Blackshirts' propaganda also features antisemitic and anti-Israel themes and tropes. An ABM sticker calls for a ban on pornography, with the Ã¢Â€ÂœoÃ¢Â€Â in Ã¢Â€ÂœpornÃ¢Â€Â replaced with a Star of David, which references a common antisemitic trope that Jews control the pornography industry as a means of spreading Ã¢Â€Âœdegeneracy.Ã¢Â€Â Another common ABM sticker reads: Ã¢Â€ÂœNo more American lives for Israeli lies,Ã¢Â€Â likely referring to a number of antisemitic conspiracy theories that claim Israel duplicitously draws the U.S. into foreign wars to advance its own geopolitical goals.

Anti-LGBTQ+

Like many other contemporary white supremacist groups and the 20th century fascists they idolize, ABM points to the existence of LGBTQ+ communities as a sign of Ã¢Â€Âœcultural degeneracyÃ¢Â€Â and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric permeates ABMÃ¢Â€Â™s propaganda and demonstrations. On December 13, 2024, ABM members protested outside a Christmas drag event in Dallas, Texas, calling the show an Ã¢Â€Âœevent which degenerates including those from out of state bring [sic] children to be indoctrinated to the cult of LGBT.Ã¢Â€Â

On November 20, 2024, individuals associated with ABM dropped a banner from a building in Dallas, Texas, that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœPedos [sic] get the rope,Ã¢Â€Â to protest a drag show taking place across the street, a reference to the dangerous baseless conspiracy theory that claims that LGBTQ+ people are Ã¢Â€ÂœgroomingÃ¢Â€Â children to abuse them.

Like the Nazi Party of 20th century Germany, ABM has held book burnings targeting Ã¢Â€Âœdegenerate literature.Ã¢Â€Â In March 2025, the group posted a series of videos showing members burning Pride flags with the caption: Ã¢Â€ÂœNo more tolerance.Ã¢Â€Â

Tactics

Demonstrations and Banner Drops

In 2024, ABM held at least 17 demonstrationsÃ¢Â€Â”typically in highly visible locationsÃ¢Â€Â”and training events, as well as numerous smaller events, like white supremacist hikes, banner drops and propaganda distributions. These include a December 22, 2024, banner drop event on an overpass in Dallas, Texas, where individuals associated with ABM and the Texas Nationalist Network displayed banners with white supremacist and Catholic symbols that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœRefugees today, terrorists tomorrowÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœOnly traitors help invaders.Ã¢Â€Â

Months earlier, on October 19, 2024, individuals associated with ABMÃ¢Â€Â”masked and dressed in blackÃ¢Â€Â”marched through downtown Orlando, Florida, chanting Ã¢Â€Âœdeportations nowÃ¢Â€Â and other slogans while targeting an LGBTQ+ pride event. During that same weekend, the group gathered at an unknown wooded location near Orlando for Ã¢Â€Âœcombative training drillsÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœsparring.Ã¢Â€Â

Individuals affiliated with ABM similarly demonstrated on June 15, 2024, on Main Street in Grapevine, Texas, where they waved flags of the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s logo, a Confederate flag and the American flag. They also held a banner that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœNo borders = weak nations,Ã¢Â€Â with images of fasces and a link to the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s Telegram channel, and distributed white supremacist propaganda.

Ã‚Â 

Propaganda Distribution

The American Blackshirts Movement regularly distributes white supremacist propagandaÃ¢Â€Â”commonly in the form of large stickersÃ¢Â€Â”that contains anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ+ messaging. The group claims to have distributed propaganda in at least 26 states since forming.

In one notable incident, on February 1, 2025, ABM distributed propaganda in Stuart, Florida, claiming that Ã¢Â€Âœanyone facilitating the housing or employment of illegals in our area will be held responsible,Ã¢Â€Â and that the Blackshirts Ã¢Â€Âœare watching.Ã¢Â€Â The propaganda subsequently garnered additional attention on X and Reddit after being shared by concerned users in posts that received thousands of likes.

Ã‚Â 

Networking

The group also regularly associates with other white supremacist groups and networks, largely through private training events. In the August 2024 interview with this antisemitic influencer, Salas claimed that ABM was Ã¢Â€Âœone of the more friendlier [sic] groups in the scene,Ã¢Â€Â and that they work with other groups because Ã¢Â€Âœwe believe that nationalism in general growing in America is a good thing.Ã¢Â€Â In June 2024, ABM joined Patriot Front, Space City Active Club and Texas Nationalist Network associates for a Ã¢Â€Âœ15-mile ruck marchÃ¢Â€Â in Houston, Texas.

Ã‚Â 

In September 2024, individuals affiliated with ABM hosted a Ã¢Â€ÂœBBQ BeatdownÃ¢Â€Â event at an unknown location in Houston that included members of the Texas Nationalist Network and the Space City Active Club. The group allegedly Ã¢Â€Âœconducted several hours of physical trainingÃ¢Â€Â in the Ã¢Â€Âœgrueling heat,Ã¢Â€Â followed by a barbeque cookout. In March 2025, ABM distributed propaganda in Sanford, Florida, with members of the Vinlanders Social Club (VSC), a violent hardcore racist skinhead gang.","[1, 2]","{1: 0.9, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.5}",HIGH

These issues include 1) a coordinated campaign to manipulate Wikipedia content related to Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and similar issues, in which a group of editors systematically evade WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s rules to shift balanced narratives toward skewed ones, spotlighting criticism of Israel and downplaying Palestinian terrorist violence and antisemitism; and 2) pro-Hamas perspectives informing Arabic-language Wikipedia content on Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

ADL has found clear evidence that a group of at least 30 editors circumvent WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s policies in concert to introduce antisemitic narratives, anti-Israel bias, and misleading information.

These 30 editors were much more active than other comparable groups of editors, on average, by a factor of at least two, based on total edits made over the past 10 years.

The 30 editors were much more likely than other editors to communicate with each other on Wikipedia: they were as much as 18x more active in group communications than comparable groups of editors.
The editors appeared to coordinate to change pages related to Israel, Palestine1, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, downplaying Palestinian antisemitism, violence, and calls to destroy Israel while foregrounding criticism of Israel.
These edits have ramped up since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and include the systematic removal of citations to reputable sources and tandem voting to keep content critical of Israel but remove coverage of Palestinian violence and terrorism.

In addition to this multiyear campaign by bad-faith editors to revise WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s content on Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ADL found evidence of biased and extremist content in Arabic-language Wikipedia. WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s rules are not applied consistently outside of some English-language pages, allowing biased pro-Hamas content in the Arabic-language edition.

Pages related to Hamas in Arabic glorify the Palestinian terrorist organization and perpetuate pro-Hamas propaganda, while failing to follow WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s rules for neutrality.

This report makes clear that Wikipedia needs to do far more to address anti-Jewish and anti-Israel bias and coordination. Until it has done that, those who rely on Wikipedia Ã¢Â€Â“ from Google Search to large language models like ChatGPT Ã¢Â€Â“ must deprioritize WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s content on issues related to Jews, Israel and the Middle East conflict so that they do not perpetuate this bias.Ã‚Â 

Throughout this report, the term Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestineÃ¢Â€Â is used to reference the page or topic name as used by Wikipedia","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/jlens-and-adl-urge-meta-shareholders-vote-shareholder-proposal-addressing,"New York, NY, April 28, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â“ JLens, a Registered Investment Advisor, and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today jointly called on shareholders of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) (Ã¢Â€ÂœMetaÃ¢Â€Â or the Ã¢Â€ÂœCompanyÃ¢Â€Â) to support Shareholder Proposal 8, which appears in the proxy for the CompanyÃ¢Â€Â™s annual meeting of shareholders, scheduled to be held on May 28, 2025.Ã‚Â 

JLensÃ¢Â€Â™ proposal urges Meta shareholders to vote FOR a measure requesting the Company to prepare a detailed report evaluating how Meta addresses hate content, including antisemitism, on its platforms.

Data from ADL shows that antisemitic incidents in the U.S. hit a record 9,354 in 2024Ã¢Â€Â”a 5 percent increase over 2023 and the highest ever recordedÃ¢Â€Â”driven by a surge in hate following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel.

This surge in antisemitism has also been mirrored online. According to the Ã¢Â€ÂœOnline Hate and Harassment: The American Experience 2024Ã¢Â€Â report by the ADL Center for Technology & Society, 41 percent of Jewish adults reported they altered their online behavior to avoid being identified as Jewish. The same research found that Facebook, owned by Meta, has been the platform where Americans most frequently experience harassmentÃ¢Â€Â”every year for the past five years.

These concerns are not limited to outside observers. On April 23, 2025, MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s ownÃ‚Â Oversight Board openly questioned whether the CompanyÃ¢Â€Â™s aggressive rollback of content moderation policies had gone too far in dismantling critical safeguards for users, and urging Meta to assess the human rights impact of its current policies. The Oversight BoardÃ¢Â€Â™s statement not only validates Shareholder Proposal 8, it also affirms and injects real urgency: investors now have confirmation from MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s self-appointed oversight group that the risk of unchecked hate speech requires swift, transparent action.

The JLens proposal, titled Ã¢Â€ÂœReport on Hate Targeting Marginalized Communities,Ã¢Â€Â specifically states:

RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Meta Platforms, Inc. prepare a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary or privileged information, detailing the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s policies, practices, and effectiveness in combating hate on its platform(s) andÃ‚Â  services, specifically antisemitism, anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-disability hate. The report may evaluate the adequacy of moderation, enforcement, user protection, ad policies, and transparency efforts, with findings made publicly available within one year.

The intent of the proposal is to provide insights into MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s content moderation practices, enforcement mechanisms, transparency measures, and its effectiveness at combating hate.

Ã¢Â€ÂœIn an era marked by increased polarization and an unprecedented rise in antisemitism globally, it is distressing that Meta has chosen to weaken its content moderation efforts. Our proposal calls upon Meta shareholders to demand transparency about what the company is doing to combat hate on Facebook and Instagram and to clearly identify where it falls short,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director.

Ã¢Â€ÂœUnchecked online antisemitism and hate risk alienating users and exposing Meta to serious financial, reputational, and regulatory threats. With over $150 billion in annual revenueÃ¢Â€Â”virtually all of it from advertisingÃ¢Â€Â”brand safety is paramount. Inadequate content moderation undermines user trust, has the potential to drive away advertisers, and jeopardizes long-term shareholder value. Investors deserve full transparency into how Meta is managing these escalating risks,Ã¢Â€Â said Ari Hoffnung, JLens Managing Director.

JLens and ADL have filed a Notice of Exempt Solicitation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide additional context and rationale for the shareholder proposal.

JLensÃ¢Â€Â™ shareholder advocacy focuses on combating antisemitism and hate, supporting Israel, and promoting the Jewish value of Tikkun Olam (repairing the world). This proxy season, JLens has run other campaignsÃ‚Â calling on shareholders to reject anti-Israel shareholder proposals atÃ‚Â General Dynamics,Ã‚Â Lockheed Martin, andÃ‚Â Intel.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/murder-and-extremism-united-states-2024,"Executive Summary
Every year, individuals with ties to different extreme causes and movements kill people in the United States; the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) tracks these murders. Extremists regularly commit murders in the service of their ideology, to further a group or gang they may belong to or even while engaging in traditional, non-ideological criminal activities.
In 2024, domestic extremists killed at least 13 people in the U.S., in 11 separate incidents. These deaths are significantly lower than the 20 people killed by extremists in 2023 or the 28 people killed in 2022. The number of people in the U.S. killed by extremists has decreased for three years in a row, but this trend will not continue. Already, COE has documented 15 extremist-related murders in 2025 so far, 14 of them stemming from the deadly vehicular terrorist attack in New Orleans on New YearÃ¢Â€Â™s Day.
One of the reasons extremist murder totals have been down in recent years has been a decrease in deadly incidents connected to domestic Islamist extremists and far-left extremists. However, the New Orleans attack, committed by an American citizen who pledged himself to ISIS, raises concerns about a possible return to violent attacks by homegrown Islamist extremists.
The 2024 murder totals are also low because, unlike in many recent years, no extremist-related mass shooting events took place.
All the extremist-related murders in 2024 were committed by right-wing extremists of various kinds, with eight of the 13 killings involving white supremacists and the remaining five having connections to far-right anti-government extremists. This is the third year in a row that right-wing extremists have been connected to all identified extremist-related killings. This trend has also been interrupted by the New Orleans attack.
Two of the deadly incidents from 2024 involved adherents of the anti-government sovereign citizen movement, including the deliberate murder of a police officer in Dallas. This report includes a special section that explores deadly violence connected to the sovereign citizen movement, including the murder of a number of law enforcement officers.",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.5}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/antisemitic-incident-data-breaks-all-previous-annual-records-2024-fourth,"New York, NY, April 22, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â¦The massive spike in antisemitic incidents following the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel continued in 2024, with totals again exceeding any other annual tally in the past 46 years. This is the fourth year in a row that antisemitic incidents increased and broke the previous all-time high.Ã‚Â It is also the first time that incidents containing elements related to Israel or Zionism made up a majority of all incidents (58 percent of the total).

There were 9,354 incidents of antisemitic assault, harassment and vandalism across the country in 2024, according to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s (the Anti-Defamation League) annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, released today. This total represents a 5 percent increaseÃ‚Â from 2023 (already a record-setting year), a 344 percent increase over the past five years, an 893 percent increase over the past 10 years and is the highest level recorded since ADL started tracking this data in 1979. The 12-month total for 2024 averaged more than 25 targeted anti-Jewish incidents in the U.S. per day, more than one an hour.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis horrifying level of antisemitism should never be accepted and yet, as our data shows, it has become a persistent and grim reality for American Jewish communities,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish Americans continue to be harassed, assaulted and targeted for who they are on a daily basis and everywhere they go. But letÃ¢Â€Â™s be clear: we will remain proud of our Jewish culture, religion and identities, and we will not be intimidated by bigots.Ã¢Â€Â

Antisemitic Incidents related to Israel or Zionism

In 2024, for the first time, a majority of all incidents (58 percent, or 5,452 incidents) were related to Israel. Of allÃ‚Â Israel-related incidents, 2,596 took place at anti-Israel rallies in the form of antisemitic speeches, chants, signs, and slogans. (About half of the more than 5,000 anti-Israel rallies tracked by ADL in 2024 contained antisemitic expressions; those that did not contain antisemitic elementsÃ‚Â were not included inÃ‚Â the Audit. When antisemitic expressions of this sort appeared at a rally, ADL tabulated them as a single incident regardless of how many times they were repeated or how many different forms they took.)

Activity and rhetoric documented at these rallies included:Ã‚Â justification or glorification of antisemitic violence, promotion ofÃ‚Â classic antisemitic tropes including blood libel, conspiracy theories and signage equating Judaism or Zionism with Nazism,Ã‚Â celebration of the anniversary of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack in Israel, andÃ‚Â unapologetic support for terrorism, designated terrorist organizations and their leaders.Ã‚Â 

Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) andÃ‚Â Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) were the two most active organizers or co-sponsors of protests where antisemitic incidents occurred, and combined were involved in over 50 percent of the protests in this category.

""In 2024, hatred toward Israel was a driving force behind antisemitism across the U.S., with more than half of all antisemitic incidents referencing Israel or Zionism,"" said Oren Segal, ADL Senior Vice President for Counter-Extremism and Intelligence. ""These incidents, along with all those documented in the Audit, serve as a clear reminder that silence is not an option. Good people must stand up, push back, and confront antisemitism wherever it appears. And that starts with understanding what fuels it and learning to recognize it in all its forms. All the data is available in theÃ‚Â H.E.A.T. Map, highlighting our commitment to transparency.""

Major Findings

Assaults: 196 incidents (a 21 percent increase from 2023) were categorized as assault, defined as cases where Jewish people (or people perceived to be Jewish) were targeted with physical violence accompanied by evidence of antisemitic animus. Orthodox Jews were targeted in 30 percent of assaults. The 196 incidents of assault targeted at least 250 victims, none of these assaults were fatal.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Vandalism: 2,606 incidents (a 20 percent increase from 2023) were categorized as vandalism, defined as cases where property was damaged along with evidence of antisemitic intent or where there was an antisemitic impact on Jews. Swastikas, which are generally interpreted as symbols of antisemitic hatred, were present in 37 percent of these cases.
Ã‚Â 
Harassment: 6,552 incidents (up from 6,535 incidents recorded in 2023) were categorized as harassment, defined as cases where one or more Jewish people (or people perceived to be Jewish) were harassed with language that includes antisemitic slurs, stereotypes or tropes. There were 647 bomb threats.Ã‚Â The harassment category also includes many of the expressions of antisemitism occurring at anti-Israel rallies described above.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Incidents on (or around) college and university campuses rose more steeply than any other location type. In 2024, ADL recorded 1,694 antisemitic incidents on college campuses, which is 84 percent higher than in 2023. Campus incidents comprised 18 percent of all incidents, a larger proportion than in any previous Audit.
Ã‚Â 
Antisemitic activity also increased by 19 percent in public areas (3,452 incidents) and by 11 percent at business establishments, including Jewish-owned businesses. 860 incidents were reported at non-Jewish K-12 schools in 2024, a decrease of 26 percent.Ã‚Â Given the insidious nature of bullying, compounded by the fact that many children may not feel empowered to report their experiences, it is likely that the actual number of school-based antisemitic incidents was significantly higher than the data reported in the Audit.
Ã‚Â 
Antisemitic incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The states with the highest levels of incidents were New York (1,437) and California (1,344). Their largest cities, New York City (976) and Los Angeles (297), also reported the most incidents.Ã‚Â 

White Supremacist Propaganda
Ã‚Â 
There were 962 antisemitic propaganda incidents (dissemination of antisemitic print materials and public events) connected to white supremacist groups last year, down 17 percent from 2023. Incidents were recorded inÃ‚Â 47 states and the District of Columbia. Three groups (Patriot Front,Ã‚Â Goyim Defense League and theÃ‚Â White Lives Matter network) were responsible for 94 percent of this activity.Ã‚Â 

Targeting of Jewish Institutions

While incidents decreased by 14 percent at Jewish institutions, they remained elevated compared to pre-October 7 levels, with 1,702 incidents recorded in 2024.Ã‚Â Moreover, assaults at Jewish institutions more than doubled (from 9 to 20 incidents) and vandalism increased by 39 percent (from 148 to 205 incidents).Ã‚Â 

Jewish organizations were targeted with a total of 627 bomb threats, 89 percent of which targeted synagogues. Congregants were harassed and even assaulted; some anti-Israel groups also escalated their tactics, protesting Jewish religious and cultural institutions on dozens of occasions.

Methodology

The ADL Audit includes both criminal and non-criminal acts of harassment, vandalism and assault against individuals and groups as reported to ADL by victims, law enforcement, the media and partner organizations and evaluated by ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s experts.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

The complete dataset for antisemitic incidents for 2016-2024 is available on ADLÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â H.E.A.T. Map, an interactive online tool that allows users to geographically chart antisemitic incidents and extremist activity. The full dataset can also be downloaded by anyone who would like to take a closer look at individual incidents.

ADL is careful to not conflate general criticism of Israel or anti-Israel activism with antisemitism. Legitimate political protest, support for Palestinian rights or expressions of opposition to Israeli policies is not included in the Audit. ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s approach to Israel-related expressions comports with the IHRA definition of antisemitism.Ã‚Â 

The complete Audit methodology is included in the report on our website.

The Audit offers a snapshot of one of the ways American Jews encounter antisemitism, but a full understanding of antisemitism in the U.S. requires other forms of analysis as well, including public opinion polling, assessments of online antisemitism and examinations of extremist activity, all of which ADL offers in other reports, such as:Ã‚Â ADL Survey of Antisemitic Attitudes in America 2024,Ã‚Â Campus Antisemitism One Year After the Hamas Terrorist Attacks, the ADL Global 100: Index of Antisemitism,Ã‚Â Online Hate and Harassment: The American Experience and White Supremacist Propaganda Assessment Focused on Jews and Immigrants in 2024.

Letters to the Editor
Jewish News Syndicate

To the Editor:

Dr. Andrew Bostom and Morton Klein conflate facts and distort findings in their attempt to reach their preconceived conclusion that ADL is Ã¢Â€ÂœhidingÃ¢Â€Â data about antisemitism among Muslim communities (Ã¢Â€ÂœADL quietly purged data on European Muslim antisemitism,Ã¢Â€Â April 18).

Nothing could be further from the truth. Our surveys have always tracked this data, and our aim has always been to be fully transparent with the findings, including those on antisemitism among Muslim communities. In fact, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a new feature on the updated Global 100 website to compare the findings specifically for Organisation of Islamic Cooperation countries.

As our most recent Global 100 data made clear, Muslim majority countries and territories had the highest antisemitism index scores, with the West Bank and Gaza at 97 percent, Kuwait at 97 percent, and Indonesia at 96. These findings have all been made public on our website and highlighted in our press release.

Since about 500 people were surveyed in most Western countries, the number of MuslimsÃ¢Â€Â”and other smaller religious groups like Buddhists or HindusÃ¢Â€Â”was too small to allow meaningful comparisons between countries.

ADL continues to track antisemitism worldwide and we will make more findings available as they are validated. We are committed to addressing antisemitism wherever it is evident, based on the data. Bottom line:Ã‚Â it is disingenuous of the authors to assert that ADL is covering up the very real issue of antisemitism in Muslim-majority countries, or in countries with large Muslim populations.

For decades, the Pacific Northwest has been home to a wide range of extremist activity. From the shootout with law enforcement that culminated in the death of white supremacist terrorist leader Robert J. Mathews on Whidbey Island, Washington, in the 1980s; to the armed seizure of the Malheur Federal Wildlife Refuge in Oregon by anti-government extremists in 2016; to the frequent street-fighting between the Proud Boys and anti-fascist protesters in Portland between 2017 and 2021, extremists have alarmed and endangered residents of the region for years.

Different types of extremists continue to cause problems in the Pacific Northwest today, including white supremacists, Proud Boys, anti-government extremists and extremists who seek the elimination of the state of Israel. In addition, the region experienced substantial increases in antisemitic activity at a time when the ADL tracked the highest-ever number of antisemitic incidents nationwide.

This report provides a snapshot of antisemitism and extremism in Oregon and Washington, highlighting key trends tracked by the ADL Center on Extremism Ã¢Â€Â“ including the disruptive actions of extreme anti-Israel activists, new networking initiatives by white supremacists and anti-government extremist efforts to build political power.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/dark-side-roblox-active-shooter-studios-create-maps-based-real-life-mass,"Roblox has established itself as one of the most popular online gaming platforms for children and teens, drawing millions of gamers worldwide on a daily basis. But beneath its kid-friendly faÃƒÂ§ade, it has also been plagued by crisis and controversy surrounding issues such as content moderation, player safety and exposure to inappropriate content. More recently, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) has uncovered a disturbing subculture on Roblox that centers around mass violence.

A group called Active Shooter Studios (A.S.S.) has gained notoriety for creating Roblox maps that replicate real-life mass shootings, including the infamous tragedies at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland, as well as mass shootings conducted by white supremacists and other extremists as terrorist attacks.

A.S.S. is part of the largerÃ‚Â True Crime Community (TCC) online subculture,Ã‚Â whose adherents have a disturbing fascination with serial killers and mass murderers, often creating dark memes and fan fiction glorifying killers and their crimes. A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s leadership has attempted to distance itself from TCC due to its controversial and negative reputation, but the group regularly uses RobloxÃ‚Â to create TCC-related content.

This content is particularly disturbing because it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t just reflect mass violenceÃ¢Â€Â”it actively helps glorify it, even if A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s leaders claim otherwise. By creating these games, A.S.S. fosters an environment where violence is not only normalized but celebrated, as seen in how the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s games are perceived by their fans and players. Moreover, because they include scenes connected to extremist-related shootings, their creations increase the overlap between the TCC subculture and extremism, particularly amongÃ‚Â accelerationist white supremacists andÃ‚Â incels.

Recreating mass tragedies

Led by a developer using the pseudonym Ã¢Â€ÂœRorshac,Ã¢Â€Â A.S.S. specializes in building highly detailed, disturbing recreations of actual tragedies. One of their most infamous maps is Ã¢Â€ÂœCarbine,Ã¢Â€Â which recreates the 1999 Columbine shooting, allowing players to take on the role of perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. The Columbine shooting is one of the events most celebrated by TCC adherents.

Ã‚Â 

Rorshac works closely with another developer, who uses the pseudonym Ã¢Â€ÂœSkinless,Ã¢Â€Â to develop these maps. While Rorshac focuses on developing the overall maps and designs, Skinless works in a more specialized capacity, focusing on creating animations for the weapons used in the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s games.

The maps created by A.S.S. are not simple game environmentsÃ¢Â€Â”they are disturbingly graphic and detailed, designed to mimic the mass shootings theyÃ¢Â€Â™re based on with unsettling accuracy and gore. For example, in A.S.S.'s map based on the 2022 Uvalde shooting, studentsÃ¢Â€Â”clearly depicted as childrenÃ¢Â€Â”are programmed to hide under desks or play dead when the shooting begins. Players can also alter their avatarÃ¢Â€Â™s appearance to resemble the assailant.

Ã‚Â 

The gore in A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s games is extreme, allowing players to maim or dismember other players and charactersÃ¢Â€Â”something that is at least nominally prohibited by RobloxÃ¢Â€Â™s community standards. A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s games also revolve around surviving until police arrive, with players eventually being forced to either die fighting or commit suicideÃ¢Â€Â”adding a disturbing violent ending to their games.

Evading detection

Despite RobloxÃ¢Â€Â™s efforts to take down these maps, A.S.S. continues to find ways to keep their content available.The group has pivoted to hosting games on paid Roblox private servers. These servers exist as part of RobloxÃ¢Â€Â™s main platform (and are ostensibly subject to their policies) but allow players to control who is admitted to these spaces, reducing the likelihood they will be detected by Roblox and have their accounts suspended.

A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s influence also extends far beyond Roblox.Ã‚Â The group runs an exclusive, private Discord server, accessible only to vetted members, which serves as a central hub for discussing new developments, sharing game links and requesting new features and content.Ã‚Â Additionally, A.S.S. organizes events where server members can play games together and provide feedback. A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s Discord server, which has undergone several iterations due to suspensions, boasts around 500 members.Ã‚Â This exclusivity has made A.S.S. and their content particularly enticing to TCC members.

The group also runs a Roblox community with approximately 800 members, where the leaders share announcements with their fanbase and promote their private Discord server. The community features a store that appears to be selling in-game Carbine-branded merchandise, including several shirts displaying the gameÃ¢Â€Â™s cover art, which users can equip on their avatars.

TikTok has also played a key role in spreading A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s content. COE analysts have found numerous TikTok accounts sharing gameplay footage for mass shooting recreations made by A.S.S. and others. The comment sections of these videos are often filled with requests for the names of and links to these games. Rorshac is known to be active on TikTok himself, frequently posting links to A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s Discord server in the comments. In addition, COE analysts have also found Reddit users sharing copies of A.S.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s maps, further spreading their disturbing content.

Ã‚Â 

While A.S.S. may be the most prominent group within the true crime community creating these maps, they are not the only ones. COE analysts have discovered other individuals developing similar content for Roblox and the game GarryÃ¢Â€Â™s Mod, indicating that this troubling trend is gaining traction within the TCC subculture.

Ã‚Â 

Roblox, Discord and TikTok all have community guidelines that prohibit content glorifying mass violence. While these platforms have taken steps to prohibit mass shooting recreations created by A.S.S. and othersÃ¢Â€Â”and have acted swiftly in response to our flagsÃ¢Â€Â”there is still more to be done. For example, what steps are platforms such as these taking to prevent the abuse of private spaces for the dissemination of these recreations? How are these platforms working together around this egregious form of content to prevent its spread between platforms?Ã‚Â 

Why this matters

Games that recreate offline incidents of mass violence not only desensitize young people to events like these but also normalize these recreations as a form of entertainment. Many mass shootersÃ¢Â€Â”including the Abundant Life and Antioch shootersÃ¢Â€Â”have expressed a fascination with previous killers, often referencing or glorifying them in their own manifestos or social media posts.

Because such games recreate extremist-related mass shootingsÃ¢Â€Â”such as theÃ‚Â 2022 Buffalo shooting, in which the perpetrator deliberately targeted and killed Black peopleÃ¢Â€Â”they may also serve as a gateway to extremist content. Players might be prompted to seek out more information about these violent events, which can lead them to manifestos or videos created by the attackers. In some cases, they may also encounter content produced by accelerationist white supremacists, which glorifies these killers and aims to radicalize others to follow in their footsteps.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/article-adl-ceo-jonathan-greenblatt-campus-antisemitism-demands-action-not,"New York, New York, April 18, 2025 ... ADL CEO and National Director Jonathan Greenblatt penned the following article that was featured in Times of Israel:

Antisemitism on college campuses is a genuine crisis that demands serious attention, but we are concerned about the extent and scope of the current approach taken by the Administration to Harvard.

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s forthcoming Audit of Antisemitic Incidents counted a staggering increase in incidents on campus in 2024. AnÃ‚Â ADL-Hillel poll last year found that 83 percent of Jewish college students experienced or witnessed antisemitism since the October 7 Hamas attacks. These numbers are mind-boggling. No one should look away. Jewish students deserve the very same civil rights, the very same constitutional protections, as those provided to all other students. Slandering them as Ã¢Â€ÂœZionists,Ã¢Â€Â blocking theirÃ‚Â entry to campus spaces,Ã‚Â vandalizing their common spaces on campuses, committing acts of masked intimidation and outright violence under the guise of Ã¢Â€Â˜decolonizationÃ¢Â€Â™ Ã¢Â€Â“ these are not courageous acts of conviction. These are cowardly acts of bigotry. Unfortunately, far too many of our most prestigious universities have failed to address such offenses, let alone punish the perpetrators after the fact. TheÃ‚Â stories areÃ‚Â legion.

When Jewish students cannot safely access education, when they face discrimination and harassment in violation of Title VI, such civil rights violations demand the same level of attention and urgency as would be applied in any other scenario. In ourÃ‚Â Campus Antisemitism Report Card, while many colleges improved their grade, far too many fell short. Just like the students enrolled in their classes, every school should aim for an A.

ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why we support solutions that correct the problem, push universities to do better, and ultimately result in stronger, more welcoming institutions that can focus on what they do best: teaching students hungry to learn; pursuing knowledge; developing cures to the most devastating diseases; and finding solutions to our most vexing challenges.

However, any actions taken to address campus antisemitism Ã¢Â€Â” including the potential withholding of federal funding Ã¢Â€Â” must be grounded in clear evidence and conducted in a manner consistent with Title VI procedures and other laws. The penalty should be proportionate and reasonably calculated to address the antisemitism on these campuses and to protect the rights of Jewish students on campus. Denying federal funds (whether in part or in total) is an extremely serious and rightfully rare punishment that should be used only in the most severe situations with institutions incapable or unwilling to improve.

Against this backdrop, the situation at Harvard University is both simple and complex.

To be clear, there has been a serious problem of antisemitism in Cambridge for years. ADL repeatedly raised this issue with Harvard leadership and provided clear asks to protect Jewish students. Often our requests fell on deaf ears Ã¢Â€Â“ and Jewish students and staff suffered as a result.Ã‚Â This is whyÃ‚Â the universityÃ‚Â earned anÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœFÃ¢Â€Â on ourÃ‚Â firstÃ‚Â Campus Report cardÃ‚Â in 2024.

However, since then,Ã‚Â HarvardÃ‚Â has taken a set of actionsÃ‚Â that boosted theirÃ‚Â gradeÃ‚Â to a Ã¢Â€ÂœCÃ¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â this year. To be clear, this is not a grade that satisfies ADL nor should it satisfy anyone associated with one of the most elite universities in the world. Nonetheless, itÃ¢Â€Â™s a step in the right direction.

The federal government recently engaged Harvard on these issues. They made a set ofÃ‚Â demands consistent with many of our longstanding asks, but they also are insisting on reforms that go far beyond ensuring the civil rights of Jewish students and faculty. They are imposing or suggesting extremely severe penalties that donÃ¢Â€Â™t tie to the issue of reducing antisemitism, such as investigating its tax-exempt status.

It should be obvious, but purely punitive gestures will not lead to long-term progress. Additionally, the issue of combating antisemitism on campus should be addressed on its own process and merits. Other debates on higher education may be important, but they can and should be resolved separate from fighting antisemitism on campus.

This does not take Harvard off the hook. Far from it. The institution needs to do a demonstrably better job to ensure that Jews benefit from the same privileges and protections as those provided to all other students. Harvard will continue to suffer reputational damage and donor repercussions until supporters and the public see credible change. However, the fight against antisemitism must be about antisemitism Ã¢Â€Â“ nothing more, nothing less.

We hope that the situation at Harvard and other universities is resolved quickly. This means that meaningful, measurable steps are identified that will ensure the civil rights of Jewish students and faculty. Once implemented by the institution, we would expect to see the resumption of funding from public and private sources for its important work serving students and life-saving research serving humanity.

Our universities are the envy of the world. They have attracted students from across the planet because of their academic excellence, their intellectual integrity and the career opportunities that they generate. Resolving the very real crisis of antisemitism should not jeopardize the entire enterprise of our system of higher education. We should be able to hold institutions accountable for protecting Jewish students, faculty, and staff while maintaining a commitment to academic freedom and independent inquiry. Again, nothing more, nothing less.","[2, 3, 4]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.6, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.5}",HIGH

Jewish American Heritage Month takes place every year in May. The month is an annual recognition and celebration of the history, achievements, contributions and culture of Jewish people in the United States. In schools and classrooms, Jewish American Heritage Month provides an opportunity to learn about the Jewish community--including who Jewish people are, what they believe in, their culture, hopes and dreams, their history, diversity and complexity. It is also important to remember that May should not be the only time that schools engage in this learning but rather, Jewish history and heritage should be integrated into the curriculum throughout the year.

This collection includes various resources for engaging students in learning, reflection and connection, specifically: lesson plans, short videos to help teach the lessons, Sutori direct-to-student learning experiences that accompany all of the lesson plans, an educators Q+A guide and more.",[3],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.8, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.5}",MEDIUM

Abstract

A pre-registered, large sample, field experiment was conducted in an effort to obtain the data necessary to objectively answer the question: do Americans who signal Jewish or Israeli backgrounds experience discrimination in the U.S. labor market? 3,000 inquiries were sent to job postings across the United States using identical email text and identical resumÃƒÂ©s that differed only in (a) the name of the applicant Ã¢Â€Â“ selected to Ã¢Â€ÂœsoundÃ¢Â€Â Jewish, Israeli, or Western European Ã¢Â€Â“ and (b) resumÃƒÂ© signals of likely Jewish, Israeli, or Western European background. The results confirm the presence of anti-Semitic behavior in this market. Relative to the control (European American), the Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish TreatmentÃ¢Â€Â needed to send 24.2% more inquiries to receive the same number of responses; the Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraeli TreatmentÃ¢Â€Â needed to send 39.0% more. All differences are statistically significant across model specifications.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",MEDIUM

On August 12, 2024, an 18-year-old donned a skull mask, black tactical helmet, gloves and body armor with a prominent sonnenrad patch. Armed with two knives and a hatchet, he stabbed five people at a tea garden near a mosque in Eskisehir, Turkey, leaving two in critical condition. Prior to the attack, the teen also attached a camera to his chest to livestream the stabbings on social media. While Turkish authorities claimed that the attacker, known as Ã¢Â€ÂœArda K.Ã¢Â€Â was Ã¢Â€Âœinfluenced by computer games,Ã¢Â€Â an ADL Center on Extremism (COE) investigation found that in addition to authoring a white supremacist manifesto that glorified mass shooters, he also extensively posted extremist and hateful content on Steam, the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest digital PC video game distribution service. Developed by U.S. software corporation Valve, Steam is a storefront for video games and a social networking space for gamers across the globe.

This attack was not the first time that Steam has been linked to the violent and hateful world of extremism. Over the years, ADL and others Ã¢Â€Â“ including researchers, media outlets, policymakers and governing bodies Ã¢Â€Â“ have warned about the proliferation of extremist content on the platform.

To understand the scale and nature of hateful and extremist content on Steam, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) conducted an analysis of public data on Steam Community on an unprecedented, platform-wide scale, analyzing 458+ million profiles, 152+ million profile and group avatar images and 610+ million comments on user profiles and groups.

COE found millions of examples of extremist and hateful content Ã¢Â€Â“ including explicit hate symbols like sonnenrads and Ã¢Â€Âœhappy merchants,Ã¢Â€Â as well as copypastas (blocks of text that are copied and pasted to form images or long-form writing) shaped into swastikas Ã¢Â€Â“ on Steam Community, the platformÃ¢Â€Â™s social networking space where users can connect, congregate and share content. The clear gaps in SteamÃ¢Â€Â™s moderation of this content inflict harm by exposing untold users to hate and harassment, enabling potential radicalization and normalizing hate and extremism in the gaming community. Understanding the extent of extremist and hateful content on the platform is key to fighting the proliferation of hate online.","[1, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

False and misleading election narratives are surging on social media platforms in the lead up to the US presidential election. Since 2022, at least three major platforms have weakened their rules against disseminating election misinformation. Of these, X/Twitter also appears to have rolled back enforcement against hateful election misinformation.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ahead of this election, a flood of narratives has surged rehashing antisemitic tropes and pushing anti-immigrant misinformation. These include rumors that immigrants are voting illegally in large numbers, that Jews or Israel are rigging the election, and that Jews were behind the assassination attempt on Trump. More outlandish theories claim that the federal government (and/or Jews) created Hurricane Helene to suppress voting in swing states like North Carolina.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",MEDIUM

October 7, 2023, was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.

Hamas, a violent Palestinian Islamist organization with a history of antisemitism, along with other Palestinian terror groups, carried out a series of attacks against Israel. More than 1,000 Israelis were killed, of whom a majority were civilians. Numerous cases of atrocities by Hamas members included rape, mutilation and the kidnapping of 251 people, some of whom were children and elderly individuals.

Previous ADL Center on Extremism (COE) analyses have shown that acts of violence against Jews and Israelis can lead to upticks in antisemitic discourse. To understand the longer-term impact of the 10/7 attacks, COE analyzed online violent antisemitism and anti-Israel content on Telegram, a large private messaging service and social media platform that attracts extremists because of its privacy protections and lack of restrictions on hate speech.

COE conducted a comprehensive analysis of English-language posts on the social media platform Telegram to assess the influence of these attacks on the level of violent online antisemitism and anti-Israel content in the subsequent weeks and months. These three terms -- antisemitism, violent online antisemitism and extreme antisemitism -- are used interchangeably in this report to describe direct threats and calls for violence, as well as dehumanizing language towards Jews and Jewish identity. COE continuously monitors several thousand Telegram channels, and for this report, researchers used a combination of qualitative, quantitative and machine learning techniques to analyze the volume, loci and reach of violent antisemitic activity on Telegram over the past year.

The results of the analysis covering April 2023-April 2024 answer three questions:

How has the volumeÃ‚Â of extreme antisemitism on Telegram evolved following the 10/7 attacks?
Where are extreme antisemitic messages taking placeÃ¢Â€Â”that is, on which channels and in what concentrations? How has this changed over time?
How has engagement with extreme antisemitic content changed since the attacks? How many users are actively responding toÃ¢Â€Â”or participating in conversations containingÃ¢Â€Â”violent antisemitic messages?

Using a multi-method approach that includes machine learning models and qualitative investigations, we provide evidence for an initial massive spike in violent antisemitic activity. However, while this spike in antisemitism subsided relatively quickly, antisemitic activity remains persistently high relative to before October 7, suggesting a Ã¢Â€Âœnew normal.Ã¢Â€Â","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

The horrific October 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian terror group Hamas triggered an eruption of antisemitism both on social media and on the ground across the United States.

The number of antisemitic incidents, already at a recordÃ‚Â high before the attack,Ã‚Â skyrocketed -- with most of the antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault in 2023 occurring between October 7 and December 31.
Anti-Israel and anti-Zionist incidents have also increased, particularly onÃ‚Â U.S. college campuses.
Online, there have beenÃ‚Â surges of antisemitic threats against Jewish communities.
Content expressingÃ‚Â explicit support for terrorism and terror organizations still circulates widely on platforms like X and Telegram, where ADL researchers foundÃ‚Â a 434% increase in violent antisemitic posts on the day of the October 7 attack.

In the 12 months since the massacre, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) has tracked key tactics and messaging patterns among activists, influencers and organizations promoting anti-Israel and antisemitic views.

The following are 10 of the most pervasive antisemitic trends that have emerged or intensified in the year since the Hamas attack.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",MEDIUM

This report will focus on the five overarching antisemitic trends that Jewish communities around the world have faced in the past year, with select examples:[1]

Surge in Global Antisemitism: Rising Incidents and Antisemitic Hate Speech
Demonizing Zionists: Targeting Individuals in Public Life
Glorifying Terror: Justifying the October 7th Attack
October 7 Denialism: Distortion and Conspiracy Theories
Governmental Actions: Antisemitic Rhetoric and Pro-Hamas Policies
1. Surge in Global Antisemitism: Rising Incidents and Antisemitic Hate Speech

Following the October 7 attack, antisemitic incidents skyrocketed around the world, including physical attacks, vandalism, arson, online threats, and more. Inflammatory rhetoric and overtly antisemitic slogans at protests and in public statements have contributed to a sharp rise in hostility towards Jewish communities in numerous countries.Ã‚Â  These include:

In France, antisemitic incidents rose 1,000 percent in the three months after October 7, more than the number of incidents for the prior three years combined.
In the UK, antisemitic incidents were up almost sixfold between October 7, 2023 and December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.
In the Netherlands, antisemitic incidents were up 818 percent in the month following October 7, compared to the average monthly total in the three years prior.
In Austria, from October 7 to December 31, 2023, antisemitic incidents were up 500 percent, compared to the same period in 2022.
In Germany, from October 7 to December 31, 2023, antisemitic incidents were up 350 percent, compared to the same period in 2022.
In Australia, during the last three months of 2023, antisemitic incidents were up 738 percent, compared to the same period in 2022.
In South Africa, during the last three months of 2023, antisemitic incidents were up 631 percent, compared to the same period in 2022.

In Lyon, France, the offices of LyonÃ¢Â€Â™s Jewish community organizations were spray painted with Ã¢Â€ÂœGaza ResistanceÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœFree Palestine.Ã¢Â€Â

Jewish people were attacked in public, including:

In Paris, France, a Jewish man was stabbed six times by a man making antisemitic remarks.
In Genoa, Italy, a rabbi was threatened with a screwdriver by a man who shouted, Ã¢Â€ÂœGo away, you dirty Zionist f..k.Ã¢Â€Â
In Munich, Germany, a man was attacked and subject to anti-Semitic insults in front of a synagogue.
In Milan, Italy, an Orthodox Jewish man was insulted on his way to a synagogue by an Italian couple who said to him, Ã¢Â€ÂœFÃ¢Â€Â”king Zionist! You kill children!Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  On his way home he was shoved by a young man who shouted antisemitic epithets at him. In Copenhagen, Denmark, the Chief Rabbi of Denmark was shoved and spit on as he exited a tram.
In London, UK, a visibly Jewish passenger was traveling on a London Underground train when he was confronted by a man who accused him of killing Muslims.
In Berlin, Germany, a 72-year-old Jewish man was insulted with antisemitic and racist insults and hit in the face by an unknown woman.

Homes of Jewish people were attacked, including:

In Paris, France, two men doused an apartment door with gasoline and set it on fire.Ã‚Â  The targeted apartment was the only one in the building with a mezuzah.
In Grenoble, France, a Jewish familyÃ¢Â€Â™s apartment was broken into and antisemitic graffiti were painted on walls, including death threats to Jews and swastikas.
In Volos, Greece, Ã¢Â€ÂœJews = NazisÃ¢Â€Â and a Star of David = swastika were painted on the wall at the entrance to a Jewish familyÃ¢Â€Â™s home.
In British Columbia, Canada, the home of a rabbi was pelted with eggs and had a Nazi symbol drawn on a window.
In Milan, Italy, a mezuzah was torn off the doorpost of a Jewish personÃ¢Â€Â™s apartment and a knife was stuck into the wood in its place.
In Vienna, Austria, eggs were thrown at the apartment door of a 93-year-old Holocaust survivor, the only door in the building with a mezuzah.
In Warsaw, Poland, a Jewish coupleÃ¢Â€Â™s front door was graffitied with Star of David.
In Belgium, Fleron, the home of Belgian Holocaust survivors was vandalized with Ã¢Â€ÂœGaza FreeÃ¢Â€Â and a swastika.
In Berlin, Germany, apartment buildings where Jews live were marked with Stars of David.

Blatant antisemitic language was used at anti-Israel demonstrations, including:

Worldwide, demonstrations featured chants including Ã¢Â€ÂœFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be freeÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â“ a call for IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s destruction and Ã¢Â€ÂœKhaybar Khaybar, oh Jew, the army of Mohammed will return,Ã¢Â€Â referencing the slaughter of Jews in the 7th century.
In Sydney, Australia, Ã¢Â€ÂœGas the JewsÃ¢Â€Â was shouted during a pro-Palestinian protest outside the Sydney Opera House.
In Milan, Italy, anti-Israel protesters shouted Ã¢Â€ÂœOpen the borders so we can kill the Jews.Ã¢Â€Â
In London, UK, a woman at an anti-Israel protest shouted, Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath to all Jews!Ã¢Â€Â and a demonstrator in an anti-Israel march yelled, Ã¢Â€ÂœHitler knew how to deal with these people.Ã¢Â€Â
In Warsaw, Poland, a woman at an anti-Israel demonstration held a sign, Ã¢Â€ÂœKeep the world clean,Ã¢Â€Â with an image of a Star of David in a trash can.
In Bologna, Italy, a Ã¢Â€ÂœHitler will see you again in hellÃ¢Â€Â sign was held at an anti-Israel demonstration.

In Hamburg, Germany, at an anti-Israel demonstration, a teenager was filmed shouting, Ã¢Â€ÂœI want Adolf Hitler back, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s my opinion. IÃ¢Â€Â™m for Hitler, for gassing the Jews.Ã¢Â€Â
2. Demonizing Zionists: Targeting Individuals in Public Life

Since October 7, the demonization of Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistsÃ¢Â€Â by individuals and non-state actors has intensified, often manifesting in doxing, exclusion from public life, and other forms of harassment.Ã‚Â  These campaigns target Jewish communities, for whom a connection to Israel is part of their religious identity. Incidents include:

In Melbourne, Australia, hundreds of Jewish Australian artists and their families were doxed by high-profile pro-Palestinian activists.
In Italy, the New Communist Party published a list of the names of over 150 Italian Jews, including political, media, and business figures, labeling them as Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist agentsÃ¢Â€Â to be Ã¢Â€Âœcondemned and foughtÃ¢Â€Â for supporting Israel.
3. Glorifying Terrorism and Justifying the October 7th Attack

In the aftermath of the October 7th massacre, alarming endorsements of terrorism by individuals and non-state actors emerged worldwide. These efforts to glorify and/or justify the Hamas attack as legitimate reflect a dangerous trend of normalizing violence, with significant implications for public and global security. These include:

Just days after October 7, French far-left MP Daniele Obono said in a radio interview that Hamas was a Ã¢Â€Âœresistance movement.Ã¢Â€Â
At a pro-Palestinian rally in Manchester, UK on October 8, Palestine Action co-founder Richard Barnard said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen we hear the resistance, the Al-Aqsa flood, we must turn that flood into a tsunami of the whole world.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Another speaker said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe have all seen the scenes and it is the most inspiring act of resistance.Ã¢Â€Â
The Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network published a Ã¢Â€ÂœCalendar of Resistance for PalestineÃ¢Â€Â with links to pro-Hamas events around the world and a call for Ã¢Â€Âœall Palestinian, Arab and international supporters of Palestine to escalate their organizing and struggle to stand with the heroic Palestinian resistance and confront colonial Zionist violence and imperialist complicity.Ã¢Â€Â
In Germany, the NGO Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestine Solidarity DuisburgÃ¢Â€Â expressed solidarity with Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestinian resistance in all forms.Ã¢Â€Â
On January 25, 2024, a restaurant was opened in the city of Karak, Jordan, named Ã¢Â€ÂœOctober 7th"".Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
4. October 7 Denialism: Distortion and Conspiracy Theories

A disturbing trend of October 7 denialism has surged globally, including efforts to downplay or distort the severity of the attack. From denying the acts of sexual violence by Hamas, to promoting conspiracy theoriesÃ¢Â€Â”such as claims that Israel was responsible for the deaths of the Nova festival participantsÃ¢Â€Â”these narratives not only rewrite history but also fuel antisemitic rhetoric and misinformation.Ã‚Â  These include:

French far-left MP David Guiraud had a criminal complaint filed against him for Ã¢Â€ÂœrevisionismÃ¢Â€Â after saying in November, Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â˜Wait, but the human shields were used by Israel. We know that, itÃ¢Â€Â™s proven. Baby in the oven! Ã¢Â€Â¦ The baby in the oven was indeed made by Israel. The disemboweled mother, itÃ¢Â€Â™s true, was done by Israel Ã¢Â€Â¦ I think itÃ¢Â€Â™s Sabra and Shatila.Ã¢Â€Â
A French influencer was given a 10-month suspended sentence for public support for terrorism and incitement to hatred after she posted a video in which she said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhenever I hear this story about the baby put in the oven, I wonder if they added salt, pepper, maybe thyme? How did they cook him? What was served with him? Don't you wonder?Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â 
JordanÃ¢Â€Â™s Queen Rania expressed skepticism over accusations that Israeli children had been butchered by Hamas.
Former Algerian MP Hafida Benhadida said at a parliamentary conference in Greece that Ã¢Â€Âœthere were no rapes.Ã¢Â€Â
5. Governmental Actions: Antisemitic Rhetoric and Pro-Hamas Policies

In the wake of October 7, some governments have escalated their antisemitic and anti-Israel rhetoric, with countries like South Africa and Turkey openly supporting pro-Hamas stances. Several nations, including Colombia and Bolivia, have severed ties with Israel, while others have abused international law through the ICJ/ICC to target Israeli officials. From trade restrictions to the expulsion of Israeli diplomats, these governmental actions contribute to a broader, dangerous shift in global politics. These include:

Colombian President Gustavo Petro compared IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s war against Hamas in Gaza to the concentration camps of the Nazi regime and likened the Israeli Prime Minister to Hitler.
On October 25, 2023, Turkish President Erdogan said that Ã¢Â€ÂœIsrael is a Ã¢Â€Â˜terrorist state,Ã¢Â€Â™ and Hamas Ã¢Â€Âœis not a terrorist organization, but a group of freedom fighters and mujahideen [warriors] who are striving to protect their lands and their citizens.Ã¢Â€Â

The tsunami of global antisemitism following October 7 should once again serve as a grim reminder that governments and international organizations need to take concrete action to fight antisemitic hate and extremism and to mitigate the risks Jewish communities and institutions face on a daily basis.

Executive SummaryÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Most tech companies have rules against hate and harassment. But until a new law in California was enacted in 2022, they had not been accountable to the American public for enforcing them. The law that could change all this, California AB 587, requires social media companies over a certain size to publish their terms of service, including key definitions of terms, and report regularly on how they are adhering to their policies.

Such reports, known as transparency reports, used to be published voluntarily, on an ad-hoc basis. They were also largely inconsistent and far from transparent. Before the law went into effect, ADL evaluated nine major social media platforms for their degree of transparency in enforcing these rules (Platform Transparency Reports - Just How Transparent? February 2024).Ã‚Â 

We found that such reports were generally not comprehensive, often lacked key metrics, were hard to find for non-experts, were inconsistent from year to year, were not published at a standard cadence (such as quarterly) and were impossible for third-party researchers or auditors to verify independently.",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.5}",MEDIUM

How do we reduce antisemitism? How do we lessen the conditions required for the normalization of antisemitism? And, among those already at least somewhat neutral, how do we cultivate a disposition of allyship?

Established by ADL in 2022, the Center for Antisemitism Research (CAR) is designed to answer those questions. Along with its network of academic partners and research fellows at universities and colleges around the world, CAR conducts qualitative and quantitative investigations to identify the primary factors underpinning antisemitism and assess interventions designed to ameliorate them. The interventions inform ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s development and continued evaluation of educational resources and programming, anti-hate messaging campaigns, and policy recommendations.

By developing and scaling evidence-based interventions that have proven to reliably address the factors underpinning antisemitism, ADL and partner organizations can effectively reduce antisemitism. This first publication in the new What WorksÃ‚Â series seeks to communicate to our audiences the insights from the most promising interventions assessed to date and to outline the subsequent steps being taken to evaluate the scalability and durability of each intervention.

Introduction

The outbreak of campus protest after the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, renewed and intensified the long-standing debate over whether social activism that questions IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s existence, or that is even critical of Israel, simply masks a new form of antisemitism, and whether Jews, students, faculty or administrators, on campuses confront a particularly hostile environment. Loud protests organized by Students for Justice in Palestine and cognate groups were sometimes accompanied by disruption of academic operations and even sporadic cases of violent conflict. This further raised the question of whether campuses are somehow left-wing Ã¢Â€ÂœbrainwashingÃ¢Â€Â factories and were somehow, either through activism, political uniformity, or classroom politicization, responsible for the rise of a new antisemitism of the left. This is a study of the attitudes towards Jews and Israel among UC students in the weeks before and after October 7th.[1]

Hersh (2024) notes that among Jewish college students, regardless of their Ã¢Â€ÂœJewishÃ¢Â€Â upbringing and engagement, the perceived social cost for supporting the state of Israel, participating in Jewish activities on campus, or merely revealing they are Jewish rose significantly between April 2022 and November/December 2023.[2] The lackluster performance of three presidents from Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and University of Pennsylvania before a U.S. House Committee in December 2023, where they appeared to equivocate on the question of whether advocating a genocide against the Jewish people constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct (and the subsequent resignation of two of them) seemed for many to confirm the suspicion that AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s elite universities do not afford Jews the same protections as other minority groups.Ã‚Â  Others, however, maintained that the concern over campus antisemitism and its relationship to hostility toward Israel are overblown: campus antisemitism remains a minor matter, its relationship to Israel is non-existent, Jewish studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ and faculty sense of isolation on campus is manufactured rather than real, and nothing had really changed in fundamental attitudes toward Jews on AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s campuses after October 7.

The concerns expressed nationally have been especially present at the various campuses of the University of California.Ã‚Â At Berkeley, campus tensions came to a head in February 2024 when violent conflict and antisemitic slogans accompanied the invitation to campus of a speaker by a Jewish student organization.Ã‚Â  At other campuses, normal academic talks on IsraelÃ¢Â€Â”even those delivered by scholars critical of the current Israeli governmentÃ¢Â€Â”could not be held after October 7 without disruption (and were sometimes transferred to on-line formats).Ã‚Â  In a March 14, 2024 letter to the University of California Regents, the Anti-Defamation League, California, estimated a 20 fold increase in antisemitic incidents across California over the same period of the previous year.[3] The Amcha Initiative claimed that although a great deal of campus antisemitism stemmed from student organization, Ã¢Â€ÂœCompared to the same 23-week period last year, we found a staggering increase of more than 1000% (from 8 to 94) in the number of incidents (e.g., lectures, statements, rallies etc.) involving anti-Zionist activism and advocacy carried out or supported by UC faculty and graduate students.Ã¢Â€Â[4]

The relationship of antisemitism to anti-Zionism is, of course, a much older question in the UC system. Reacting to concerns about campus climate for Jewish students across the University of California, in 2016 the Board of Regents unanimously endorsed a policy called Ã¢Â€ÂœPrinciples Against Intolerance,Ã¢Â€Â which directed UC chancellors to implement the statement on their campuses. Especially highlighted were what was termed Ã¢Â€Âœanti-Semitism, anti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionism, and other forms of discrimination.Ã¢Â€Â The report also noted that, Ã¢Â€ÂœExpressions of anti-Semitism are more coded and difficult to identifyÃ¢Â€Â¦In particular, opposition to Zionism is often expressed in ways that are not simply statements of disagreement over politics and policy, but also assertions of prejudice and intolerance toward Jewish people and culture.Ã¢Â€Â[5]

A 2020 student survey (Shenhav-Goldberg and Kopstein 2020) weighed into the debate over the relationship between antisemitism and anti-Zionism on UC campuses using a sample from UC Irvine. It found a modest and positive correlation exists between the two sets of attitudes, but these attitudes do not appear to have been produced on campus. At the same time, hostility toward Israel was the best predictor of antisemitism, suggesting the impact of pre- or extra-campus socialization.Ã‚Â Overall, while antisemitic incidents on campus have recently spiked, campus environments were inhospitable toward Jews even prior to October 7.

In what follows we reengage this debate under different circumstances with better data across multiple University of California campuses.Ã‚Â  We find, again, a positive, but weak correlation between anti-Jewish attitudes and those critical of Israel. With the introduction of proper controls, however, attitudes critical of Israel emerge as the best predictor of anti-Jewish views. We also continue to show that for anti-Jewish attitudes, campus effects are weakÃ¢Â€Â”although critical attitudes toward Israel modestly increase with time spent at the University, anti-Jewish ones do not. Instead, the data is consistent with attitudes being produced before or outside of the campus experience.Ã‚Â Our survey benefited from the fact that a portion of it was fielded before October 7, 2023, which allows us to assess whether the massacre in the Gaza envelope and the ensuing war produced either sympathy or greater hostility toward Jews on campus. Roughly 32% of respondents (N=695) were surveyed during the pre-October 7 period, while 68% (N=1,497) took the questionnaire after October 7. In defiance of our expectation, antisemitic attitudes across the board increased among students after October 7; the increase is moderate but real and may account for the sense of isolation and hostility that many Jewish students and faculty reported on various University of California campuses in the weeks and months after the onset of the Israel-Hamas war.","[2, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.6}",HIGH

Ã‚Â 

Social media content creators on sites like YouTube are suffering due to severe harassment. Members of minoritized groups, such as women, Jews, people of color, and LGBTQ+ creators, are especially at risk for identity-based harassment. This harassment is typically experienced in the form of hateful comments creators receive on their content. In an original user research study, ADL finds that YouTube creators who face harassment, especially identity-based harassment, are stressed and overwhelmed moderating these comments. To help alleviate this we propose instead a user-centered, collaborative tool that enables creators to moderate their comments automatically, using customizable templates they can share.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",MEDIUM

Severe online hate and harassment increased four points across the board in the past year, which was dominated by an unprecedented surge in antisemitism online and offline in the wake of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ brutal attack on Israel on October 7. Decreases in platform enforcement and data access and new threats of hate and disinformation from generative AI tools all potentially contributed to this yearÃ¢Â€Â™s findings.

ADL conducts this nationally representative survey annually to find out how many American adults experience hate or harassment on social media. Since 2022, we have also surveyed teens ages 13-17. This survey was conducted in February and March 2024 and asked about the preceding 12 months.Ã‚Â 

Key Findings
Severe harassment overall went up: 22% of Americans experienced severe harassment1 on social media in the past 12 months, an increase from 18% in 2023 (including an increase in physical threats from 7% to 10%).
Harassment by disability: People with disabilities were more likely to be harassed than non-disabled people, 45% compared to 36% respectively for any harassment and 31% vs. 19% for severeÃ‚Â harassment.
People with disabilities were more likely to be harassed than in the year before, 45% compared to 35% for any harassment and 31% vs. 20% for severe harassment
Harassment for disability spiked:Ã‚Â Reasons for online harassment in the past 12 months remained stable, except for disability, which spiked from 4% to 12%, despite the proportion of disabled respondents remaining similar.
LGBTQ+ people were the most harassed of the marginalized groups surveyed:Ã‚Â LGBTQ+Ã‚Â people experienced increases in physical threats (from 6% to 14%), whileÃ‚Â transgender people, as a subgroup, reported severe harassment to a higher degree from last year (from 30% to 45%).
Jewish adults were more likely to be harassed for their religion (34% of those harassed compared to 18% of non-Jews)Ã‚Â andÃ‚Â 41% changed their online behavior to avoid being recognized as Jewish. Nearly two-thirds (63%) felt less safe than they did last year.
Platforms: Facebook remains the most common platform where harassment was experienced at 61% of harassment, while the incidence of harassment rose on WhatsApp (from 14% to 25%) and Telegram (from 7% to 13%).
Key Recommendations

Allow researchers inside the black box:Ã‚Â The federal government should broaden data access for researchers and follow CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s lead and require technology companies to standardize transparency reporting and broaden data access.

Address hate on messaging apps:Ã‚Â Messaging platforms should strengthen anti-hate policies and invest in tools to combat hate and harassment.

Support targets of hate:Ã‚Â Platforms should implement recommended reporting tools and features that reduce hate and improve abuse reporting.

Invest in trust and safety:Ã‚Â Tech companies should increase trust and safety resources (human and automated) to ensure platforms are enforcing their rules around hate speech and violence.

The companies, General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), are portfolio holdings of TOV, a faith-based ETF that was launched earlier this year to advocate for Jewish communal interests.

JLens noted that Proposal 4, expected to be submitted to a shareholder vote at the General Dynamics annual meeting on May 7, 2025, cites the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s sales of arms to Israel as a reason that it believes the company should conduct a Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA). Similarly, Proposal 5, expected to be submitted to a shareholder vote at the Lockheed Martin annual meeting on May 9, 2025, is critical of that companyÃ¢Â€Â™s sale of military equipment and systems to Israel, and asks its Board of Directors to evaluate and report on the alignment of its political activities with its human rights policy, ostensibly implying that they are not consistent.

Both proposals include deeply misleading and inflammatory allegations, accusing General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin of complicity in war crimesÃ¢Â€Â”and, in the case of General Dynamics, even genocideÃ¢Â€Â”due to their lawful defense partnerships with Israel. These claims are false, defamatory, and part of a broader campaign aimed at delegitimizing IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s right to self-defense and existence.

The Boards of Directors of both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin have recommended that their respective shareholders vote AGAINST the above-noted shareholder proposals.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWhile both the shareholder proposals filed at General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin claim to be concerned with human rights, they are actually thinly disguised attempts to pressure these companies into severing ties with Israel, a major objective of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement,Ã¢Â€Â noted Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of ADL (the Anti-Defamation League). Ã¢Â€ÂœThe TOV ETF was created with the support of ADL precisely to combat this kind of insidious antisemitic and anti-Israel activity.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœThese politically charged proposals dangerously ignore IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s critical security context and right to self-defense. The horrific October 7 Hamas terror attacks tragically illustrate why robust defense partnerships are vital. We strongly urge investors to reject these attempts to deprive Israel of essential defensive tools and vote AGAINST these harmful resolutions,Ã¢Â€Â said Ari Hoffnung, JLens Managing Director.

DespiteÃ‚Â widespread exposure to such content, game companies have generally been slower than social media companies to address this issue.

ADL recommends that all gaming companies form policies explicitly prohibiting the support of extremism and terrorism, especially the glorification of violent acts and the spreading of extremist ideology.

Online games rely on policies that set the rules by which players in an online multiplayer game are expected to abide in order to guide behavioral norms and curb online hate and harassment. But few address extremism (such as white supremacy) and terrorism, in their policies. All major social media platforms, in contrast, have policies against content that promotes terrorism and extremism, in many cases in response to past problems with extremist groups using their platforms to recruit.

Many players of online games such as League of Legends or Call of Duty use these games to find other players and make friends. Unfortunately, this kind of platform can also be used to normalize extremist rhetoric, or even potentially exploited by extremist and terrorist groups to recruit members and possiblyÃ‚Â plan violent offline activities. Young people still forming their world view are prime targets for extremist groups. As a result, they areÃ‚Â more susceptible to extremist propaganda and ideology. Furthermore, many online games are popular with young men,Ã‚Â prime targets for recruitment by extremist groups. Even when online activities of extremist and terrorist groups do not lead directly to offline violence, these groups are dangerous and detrimental to online community safety.

Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Roblox Corporation stand out for specifically addressing extremismÃ‚Â and terrorism in their platform policies. Each of the three companies in ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s most recent research approaches extremism and terrorism differently in their policies: Activision BlizzardÃ‚Â has incorporated it into a Call of DutyÃ¢Â€Â™s player-facing code of conduct.

Since the March 3, 2025, release of the report card, ADL's regional offices have actively worked with a substantial number of the assessed institutions to guide them in adopting best practices and policies to combat antisemitism.

As part of these consultations, schools were provided with a grace period until the end of March to implement new policies and submit updated information to inform their report card grade.

The consultations have also resulted in the revision of grades for 19 institutions, reflecting the positive changes made in response to ADL'sÃ‚Â Six Asks. Critically, these consultations have led to tangible outcomes: as a result of the 2025 Report Card, six universities have now established task forces or councils dedicated to combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life on campus that will formulate recommendations to their leadership. Moreover, six institutions have now amended their non-discrimination policies to explicitly include antisemitism, and five of those also included anti-Israeli bias.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe consultations ADL has engaged in with universities and colleges are part of our commitment to fostering safer and more inclusive environments for Jewish students and all members of the campus community,Ã¢Â€Â said Shira Goodman, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s VP of Advocacy and Head of the Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE). Ã¢Â€ÂœAddressing antisemitism on campuses across the United States is one of our top priorities and the willingness of many schools to engage with us after the release of our report card shows this is a priority for them as well. We hope this continues and that more schools will continue to engage, take action and see their climate improve.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL remains dedicated to supporting educational institutions in their efforts to create campuses free from antisemitism and hate. The organization encourages all colleges and universities to strive for excellence in their policies and practices, aiming for an 'A' grade as the standard for commitment to no tolerance for antisemitism.

TheÃ‚Â 2025 Campus Antisemitism Report Card evaluated institutions based on 30 criteria across three categories: administrative policies, Jewish life on campus, and campus conduct and climate concerns. This comprehensive assessment provides a critical tool for stakeholders, including students, parents, faculty, and alumni, to understand the current state of antisemitism on campuses and the effectiveness of institutional responses.

The Campus Antisemitism Report Card is a project of theÃ‚Â ADL Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) and the recently launchedÃ‚Â Ratings and Assessments Institute (RAI).

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/audit-antisemitic-incidents-2023,"Executive Summary
Each year, ADL (Anti-Defamation League) tracks incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault in the United States. Since 1979 we have published this information in an annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents.
In 2023, ADL tabulated 8,873 antisemitic incidents across the United States. This represents a 140% increase from the 3,698 incidents recorded in 2022 and is the highest number on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979. In fact, ADL tracked more incidents in 2023 than in the previous three years combined.
Incidents increased in all major Audit categories. Assault incidents increased by 45% to 161 incidents, vandalism increased 69% to 2,177 incidents and harassment increased 184% to 6,535 incidents.
The dramatic increase in incidents took place primarily in the period following the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel. Between October 7 and the end of 2023, ADL tabulated 5,204 incidents -- more than the incident total for the whole of 2022. Fifty-two percent of the incidents after October 7 (2,718) included references to Israel, Zionism or Palestine.
However, even prior to October 7, there were monthly increases inÃ‚Â February (402), March (471), April (432), May (437) and September (513). Each of these months broke the prior record for most incidents recorded in a single month, set in November 2022 (394).Ã‚Â 
After October 7, ADL observed explicitly antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric at 1,352 anti-Israel rallies across the United States. Leaving out all Israel-related incidents, antisemitic incidents still rose by 65% to 5,711 over the 3,457 non-Israel-related incidents recorded in 2022.
Antisemitic incidents also increased year-over-year in all major location categories. Incidents at K-12 schools increased by 135% to 1,162 incidents. Incidents at Jewish institutions jumped by 237% to 1,987, driven mostly by massive waves of hoax threats directed at synagogues and other institutions in the summer, fall and winter. And incidents on college and university campuses spiked by a staggering 321% to 922 incidents, most of which occurred after the October 7 terrorist attacks.
ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2023 Audit numbers contain 1,350 incidents included due to a post-October 7 methodology update (see Major Findings below).Ã‚Â Excluding incidents included under the methodology update, ADL tabulated 7,523 incidents, a 103% increase in antisemitic incidents from the incident total in 2022.
In response to the historic rise in antisemitic incidents, ADL urges Members of Congress to cosponsor and pass the Countering Antisemitism Act and Governor and state leaders to create and adopt State Strategies to Counter Antisemitism following the framework of the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.","[1, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

Each year, the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) tracks the distribution of white supremacist propaganda and the number of events organized or attended by white supremacists. Since 2018, we have published this information in an annual assessment.

In 2023, for the second year in a row, ADL recorded its highest ever number of white supremacist propaganda incidents, with a total of 7,567 cases. This is a 12 percent increase from the 6,746 incidents in 2022.

There was also a 30 percent increase in specifically antisemitic propaganda, rising to 1,112 incidents in 2023 from 852 incidents in 2022. This increase was largely due to the white supremacist group Patriot Front reincorporating antisemitic phrases into their propaganda. It was also buoyed by anti-Zionist and anti-Israel sentiment following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

Anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda by white supremacists saw a massive 141 percent jump, increasing from 68 incidents in 2022 to 164 in 2023.

There were 282 documented white supremacist events in 2023, a 63 percent increase from the 173 recorded in 2022.

This annual assessment is just one dataset that helps to quantify the hate marginalized communities, especially those who are Jewish, LGBTQ+, Black or immigrants, face on a daily basis. The numbers in this assessment are subject to change as law enforcement and other stakeholders release information that could increase the total amount of propaganda incidents in individual states.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitic-attitudes-america-2024,"Executive Summary

In the months since the October 7th, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel, the global Jewish community has witnessed an increase in antisemitic activity, unprecedented in recent years. For many in and around Jewish communities, this period has felt inherently different, a sentiment that has raised several critical questions about the current scope, nature, and implications of antisemitism.

To explore this, the ADL Center for Antisemitism Research has collected data since October 7th related to the scale and structure of the phenomenon of antisemitism in the United States and compared results to past findings.

This study of 4,143 Americans, fielded between January 5th and January 18th, 2024, (with a margin of error of approximately 1.5%) found the following trends:

Anti-Jewish trope beliefs continue to increase, and younger Americans are showing higher rates.

From 2022 to 2024, the average number of anti-Jewish tropes endorsed by Americans increased from 4.18 to 4.31 out of 14. Using the original 11 statements comprising the ADL Index, agreement with 6 or more anti-Jewish tropes increased from 20% of the U.S. population in 2022 to just under 24% in 2024.
In a reversal of past trends, younger Americans are more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes, with millennials agreeing with the greatest number of anti-Jewish tropes on average, at 5.4. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re followed by Gen Z at 5, Gen X at 4.2, and Baby Boomers at 3.1.
In addition to individual attitudes, more than 42% of Americans either have friends/family who dislike Jews (23.2%) or find it socially acceptable for a close family member to support Hamas (27.2%).

Conspiratorial thinking and social dominance orientation are key predictors of anti-Jewish belief.

Belief in conspiracy theories continues to be one of the main correlates of antisemitic attitudes, with an overall average correlation of .378 with anti-Jewish trope belief. Respondents who fall in the upper quartile of conspiracy theory belief endorsed over twice as many anti-Jewish tropes, on average, as those with the least conspiracy theory belief.
Anti-Jewish belief also correlates heavily with social dominance orientation Ã¢Â€Â“ the belief that there should be higher status groups and that they should suppress lower status groups. For example, respondents who at least somewhat agreed with the statement that some groups of people are inferior to other groups were 3.6 times more likely to fall in the top quartile of anti-Jewish trope belief compared to those who did not.
There was also a strong relationship with the belief that the problems in the world Ã¢Â€Âœcome down to the oppressor vs the oppressed.Ã¢Â€Â Those who at least somewhat agreed with this belief were 2.6 times more likely to fall in the top quartile of anti-Jewish trope belief compared to those who disagreed with the statement.

A significant percentage of Americans hold anti-Israel positions, but also support a Jewish stateÃ¢Â€Â™s right to exist.

Significant percentages of Americans hold certain anti-Israel positions, such as 20.1% who expressed support for removing Israeli products from a local grocery store and 30.4% who said supporters of Israel control the media. Younger Americans take these positions at significantly higher rates.
However, support for an independent Jewish state remains high, with 88.8% saying Jews have the right to an independent country. This is true even among those who take other anti-Israel positions. For example, 83.8% of people who believe that Israelis intend to cause as much suffering to Palestinians as possible believe that there should be a Jewish state.
October 7th and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war has not resulted in major changes in the percentage of Americans who hold anti-Israel positions.
However, in just about every anti-Israel position assessed, increased polarization appears evident. The proportion of respondents strongly agreeing or strongly disagreeing with Israel-related policies grew from the summer of 2023 to the present, whereas the proportion of those who somewhat agreed or somewhat disagreed shrank.

Individuals who held negative attitudes toward Israel-related policies, Israeli people, and Israel-oriented conspiracy theories were significantly more likely to believe anti-Jewish tropes.

Respondents not comfortable buying products from Israel were 3.4 times more likely to be among the top quartile of believers in anti-Jewish tropes.
Respondents who do not think Jews have the right to an independent country were 3.7 times more likely to be among the top quartile of believers in anti-Jewish tropes.
Respondents who believe Israelis intend to cause as much suffering to Palestinians as possible were 4.6 times more likely to be among the most antisemitic Americans.
Respondents who believe Israeli operatives are secretly manipulating US national policy through AIPAC or other influence tools were 7.5 times more likely to be among the top quartile of believers in anti-Jewish tropes.

Views of Hamas are also deeply concerning, with more than half of Gen Z expressing some degree of comfort being friends with a Hamas supporter.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/institute-critical-study-zionism-five-things-know,"1. The Institute for the Critical Study of Zionism is a non-profit organization seeking to dismantle Zionism.

The Institute for the Critical Study of Zionism (ICSZ) is a far-left, explicitly anti-Zionist non-profit organization founded in 2023 by prominent anti-Zionist activists and academics who seek the villainization and wholesale rejection of ZionismÃ¢Â€Â”the movement for the self-determination and statehood of the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, IsraelÃ¢Â€Â”from academia. Utilizing a scholastic veneer, this activist group works to establish anti-Zionist activism as an academic discipline and as the only acceptable moral and scholarly stance in academia.

The ICSZÃ¢Â€Â™s stated mission is Ã¢Â€Âœto support the delinking of the study of Zionism from Jewish StudiesÃ¢Â€Â and to place Zionism in the same realm academically as Ã¢Â€Âœdecolonial studies, critical terrorism studies, settler colonial studies.Ã¢Â€Â It works toward this mission by promoting a subject it calls Ã¢Â€ÂœCritical Zionism Studies,Ã¢Â€Â which frames Zionism as a co-conspirator or relative of ideologies such asÃ‚Â Nazism,Ã‚Â fascism,Ã‚Â racism, sexism, homophobia, capitalism, transphobia and Hindutva (a form of Indian ethno-nationalism), among others.

In the ICSZÃ¢Â€Â™s view, the current association between the study of Zionism and Jewish Studies effectively shields the movement for Jewish self-determination from the political and ideological critiques they seek to normalize. As its handout on Critical Zionism Studies states, Ã¢Â€Âœwe have to delink [Zionism] from areas of study that fence it off from political and ideological critiqueÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœmake clearÃ¢Â€Â that the study of Zionism Ã¢Â€Âœis deeply and essentially connected to the study of global forces including contests over power, race, colonialism, capital, militarism, and violence.Ã¢Â€Â

The delinking of Zionism from Jewish and Israel Studies serves two goals: to advance the cause of anti-Zionism and to discredit accusations of antisemitism.

The ICSZ believes Ã¢Â€Âœaccusations of antisemitism are weaponized to advance Zionist politicsÃ¢Â€Â and sees the need to Ã¢Â€ÂœreclaimÃ¢Â€Â the definition of antisemitism Ã¢Â€Âœaway from the way that Zionists misuse it,Ã¢Â€Â ICSZ board member Sara Kershnar said on the April 15, 2024, episode of the ICSZ podcast Unpacking Zionism.

The desired end goal of this Ã¢Â€ÂœreclamationÃ¢Â€Â and of delinking Zionism Studies from Jewish Studies is to ultimately defeat charges of antisemitism against the anti-Zionist movement and instead label Zionism itself as Ã¢Â€Âœinherently antisemitic,Ã¢Â€Â as Yulia Gilich, a member of the ICSZ's founding collective, put it in the opening statement on the podcast episode. The speakers in this episode allege that Zionism, and not anti-Zionism, Ã¢Â€Âœembraces many antisemitic concepts and... advances themÃ¢Â€Â by supposedly isolating Jews and denigrating the Jewish diaspora.

The institute is not formally affiliated with any particular university and has individual members associated with different activist organizations and universities. It is also a registered 501(c)3 organization that solicits donations via itsÃ‚Â website and receives funding from the Sparkplug Foundation, of which ICSZ Director Emmaia Gelman is a trustee.

The ICSZÃ¢Â€Â™s Points of Unity and various statements by the organization and its members make it clear that, beyond academia, it has organized to oppose and dismantle Zionism and the State of Israel.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™re opposed to Zionism and call for its elimination,Ã¢Â€Â ICSZ board member Robin Kelley, a UCLA professor, stated on the November 11, 2023, episode of Unpacking Zionism.

In a May 13, 2024, episode, ICSZ board member Ronit Lentin said Zionism was ""not a national liberation movement"" and that there should be ""thinking about dismantling this state and constructing, instead of it, a different political entity.""

In response to the January 2025 temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the ICSZ posted on Instagram: Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat will not end with this ceasefire is Zionism, which underwrites this genocideÃ¢Â€Â¦ We affirm that the only permanent end to Palestinian dispossession & genocide is the dismantling of Zionism and its settler state.Ã¢Â€Â

These positions lend themselves more to activist strategy and expediency rather than any academic or scientific priority.

2.Ã‚Â ICSZ leaders and members repeatedly engage in inflammatory rhetoric.

The ICSZ and its leaders have frequently made deeply inflammatory and harmful statements, and some leaders have troubling histories of publicly supporting terrorism and violence, including HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7 attack.

For example, Sean Malloy, a founding ICSZ member and an associate professor of history and critical race and ethnic studies (CRES) at University of California, Merced, reposted at leastÃ‚Â four tweets on X glorifying, justifying or downplaying the Hamas attack within days of October 7, including one seeminglyÃ‚Â mocking the victims of the massacre at the Nova music festival.

Ã‚Â 

In April 2021, Malloy was scheduled to appear on a Zoom panel at San Francisco State University withÃ‚Â Leila Khaled, a leader of the U.S.-designated terrorist organization theÃ‚Â Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The panel was shut down for violating ZoomÃ¢Â€Â™s terms of service.

ICSZ founding member Prof. Rabab Abdulhadi has also made statements defending the October 7 violence, such as aÃ‚Â tweet on the day of the attack saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo innocent bystanders here.Ã¢Â€Â InÃ‚Â another tweet on October 7, she also repudiated a condemnation of the violence.

.

Ã‚Â 

Gelman has also published several deeply inflammatory social media posts and statements. The day after the October 7 attack, Gelman published a celebratory post on Instagram that included images of Hamas fighters bulldozing through the Israel-Gaza border. She expressed that she was Ã¢Â€Âœ[e]xcited for millions of Americans who have nodded along with land acknowledgements to get behind this, and resist cries that actual decolonization (but not Israeli ethnic cleansing) is somehow Ã¢Â€Â˜too much.Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â Responding to a reply that, Ã¢Â€ÂœThey murdered 250 kids at a music festival, Emmaia,Ã¢Â€Â she remarked, in part, that Ã¢Â€Âœthere are very few deaths that IÃ¢Â€Â™d celebrate, but many uprisings against terrible, impossible conditions [...] resulted in deaths, including unjust deaths.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

3. The ICSZ promotes conspiratorial claims about antisemitism and Zionism.

The ICSZ has collectively used its platforms, including its annual publication, the Journal for the Critical Study of Zionism (JCSZ), to legitimize false and even dangerously conspiratorial claims within the academic world about the nature of antisemitism and Zionism.

For instance, one article in the first issue of the journal in the fall of 2023 cites an essay that falsely asserted that Zionism sees Jews as a Ã¢Â€Âœchosen raceÃ¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â akin to Ã¢Â€ÂœNazi Aryanism.Ã¢Â€Â It also makes the false claim that ZionismÃ¢Â€Â™s goal is toÃ‚Â perpetuate antisemitism for the furtherance of its mission. To make this point, the article includes multipleÃ‚Â conspiratorial accusations that Zionists intentionally conspiredÃ¢Â€Â”in the service of furthering ZionismÃ¢Â€Â”to over-publicize their frustration surrounding the vandalism of a Cologne synagogue in 1959. According to the authors, it was this publicity in global media that directly led to a surge of hundreds of copycat incidents of antisemitic vandalism, which Zionists supposedly intended as an opportunity to bolster the Jewish diasporaÃ¢Â€Â™s identification with Zionism.

This article further contends that Ã¢Â€ÂœZionism is the primary beneficiary of antisemitism, Ã¢Â€ÂœZionism is... antisemitism,Ã¢Â€Â and that Ã¢Â€Âœthere is not really any systemic social, political, or economic oppression of Jewish people existent anywhere in the world.Ã¢Â€Â

This article also introduces a deeply problematic idea, which the journal's Ã¢Â€ÂœKeyword + MicrosyllabusÃ¢Â€Â section makes clear is in fact the central theme of the entire issue: the so-called Ã¢Â€Âœantisemitism industrial complex.Ã¢Â€Â According to the article, the antisemitism industrial complex is Ã¢Â€Âœa network of powerful actors with financial and other material incentives to continue to (re)produce the problem they ostensibly exist to alleviate.Ã¢Â€Â

The ICSZÃ¢Â€Â™s editorial board notes that the inspiration for this concept came from Norman FinkelsteinÃ¢Â€Â™s notion of a so-called Ã¢Â€ÂœHolocaust industry,Ã¢Â€Â or an exploitative mechanism in which Zionists weaponize and exploit memorialization and commemoration of the Holocaust to threaten and extort money and political favors.

In their own words, the board claims that the Ã¢Â€ÂœHolocaust industryÃ¢Â€Â is Ã¢Â€Âœan ongoing political effort by Zionist actors to exploit the historical suffering of Jewish people in Nazi Germany, as these actors demand that European countries pay reparations to Zionist causes, including to the Israeli government, in order to avoid accusations of antisemitism and, in turn, the threat of U.S. sanctions.Ã¢Â€Â

4. The ICSZÃ¢Â€Â™s ""scholar-activists"" blur the lines between academic study and anti-Zionist activism.

As the ICSZ is composed of both academics and activists with a strong anti-Zionist mission, its approach is to use academic credentials to confer maximal institutional legitimacy and an air of scholastic rigor onto anti-Zionist activism. A key rhetorical tactic across the activities of the ICSZ is to blur the line between scholarship and activism.

Members have referred to themselves as Ã¢Â€Âœscholars and activists,Ã¢Â€Â and a podcast episode host described members and a guest speaker as Ã¢Â€Âœscholar-activists.Ã¢Â€Â

Since its inaugural conference in October 2023, the instituteÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â activities have expanded to include additional events, workgroups, research workshops, a digital library of resources for research, podcasts, the creation of shareable social media materials, fellowships and syllabi for academic courses in Critical Zionism Studies.

The instituteÃ¢Â€Â™s leaders are aware of the need to maintain a faÃƒÂ§ade of institutional legitimacy and note that to be viewed merely as activists would beÃ‚Â negatively construed. Its published materials frequently extend the label of Ã¢Â€ÂœresearchÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœscholarshipÃ¢Â€Â onto purely activist materials and actions.

The Journal for the Critical Study of Zionism serves as one important vehicle for this. In the inaugural issue, the editorial collective described its vision to provide Ã¢Â€Âœa much-needed publication venue for scholars who struggle against censorship and distorted knowledge on this crucial topic.Ã¢Â€Â

However, though it utilizes the veneer and language of an academic journal, it also seeks to provide activist materials and resources. For instance, one of the journalÃ¢Â€Â™s sections, Organizing Notes, is described as providing Ã¢Â€Âœtools and transcripts for anti-Zionist organizingÃ¢Â€Â and contains an example letter for a local campaign against a county government adopting the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Additionally, calls for papers emphasize special interest in decidedly non-academic submissions. A call for papers for the journalÃ¢Â€Â™s second issue in 2024 invites the submission of proposals and abstracts aimed at Ã¢Â€Âœchallenging and resisting Zionism.Ã¢Â€Â

As another example, one majorÃ‚Â stated function of the ICSZ is the curation of what it calls Ã¢Â€Âœa growing library of research and analytical writing.Ã¢Â€Â While this virtual library on the organizationÃ¢Â€Â™s website includes some think pieces and research articles, these are co-mingled with activist materials such as toolkits and brochures the institute has produced for campaigns against the adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism, statements of solidarity from organizations such asÃ‚Â Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), large numbers of opinion pieces by institute members, and various Ã¢Â€ÂœzinesÃ¢Â€Â with titles such as Ã¢Â€ÂœTell Citibank: Stop Financing GenocideÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœHow to Liberate a Dining Hall.Ã¢Â€Â

A particularly disturbing zineÃ‚Â available in their digital library celebrates the Hamas-led October 7 massacre of Israelis, titled Operation Al-Aqsa Flood (HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s official name for the attack), calling it Ã¢Â€Âœan act of decolonization.Ã¢Â€Â

A zine from the ICSZ's digital library celebrating the Hamas-led October 7 massacre is titled Operation Al-Aqsa Flood (HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s official name for the attack) and described as Ã¢Â€Âœan act of decolonization.Ã¢Â€Â (Screenshot)

Ã‚Â 

The institute is also trying to gain academic legitimacy by partnering with established university centers and programs. In addition to anti-Zionist activist groups such as JVP and the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI), its first conference was co-sponsored by a number of academic programs and centers, notably the University of California, Santa CruzÃ¢Â€Â™s Critical Race & Ethnic Studies Department and its Center for Racial Justice, the San Francisco State University (SFSU) Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diaspora Studies Program (AMED), and the UC Ethnic Studies Faculty Council.

Several of these programs and centers are headed or staffed by ICSZ founders or board members and are not wholly independent partners.

The SFSU AMED Program, for instance, is led by Prof. AbdulhadiÃ¢Â€Â”also a member of theÃ‚Â National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) Advisory BoardÃ¢Â€Â”and the UC Santa Cruz Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Department isÃ‚Â home to four ICSZ leaders.

In partnering their departments with the ICSZ, members use their positions within academia to reinforce and bestow additional academic credibility upon their activism.

However, the ICSZ intentionally disregards certain norms and conventions of scientific inquiry, such as disallowing or discounting the investigation of Zionist perspectives and narratives, on principle. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe reject the claim that those who critically study Zionism must debate its merits: our opposition to Zionism, colonialism, and white supremacy is a first principle,Ã¢Â€Â says itsÃ‚Â FAQ page.

The institute takes anti-Zionist narratives as its starting point andÃ‚Â does not allow for any debate over statements such as Ã¢Â€ÂœIsrael is a settler-colonial state.Ã¢Â€Â Guest speakers on its podcasts have also disregarded or minimized what should be key facets in the rigorous study of Zionism, such as theÃ‚Â diversity of Zionist thought or even the fact that there are different types of Zionism.

It also dubiously and uncritically links Zionism to entirely unrelated or even opposing ideologies. Some of its rhetorical tactics are reminiscent of a long history ofÃ‚Â Soviet anti-Zionist propaganda, notably the insistence on uncriticallyÃ‚Â linking Zionism with Nazism and imperialism.

5. The ICSZ rejects the IHRA definition of antisemitism and framed its inaugural conference around Ã¢Â€ÂœbattlingÃ¢Â€Â this definition.

The ICSZ takes particular issue with theÃ‚Â International Holocaust Remembrance AllianceÃ¢Â€Â™s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, whichÃ¢Â€Â”while controversial in some left-leaning circlesÃ¢Â€Â”is widely accepted. The 2016 IHRA definition, crafted by the 31-nation International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (including the United States), has since been adoptedÃ‚Â or endorsed byÃ‚Â over 1,000 additional entities, including governments, NGOs and universities. IHRA is the most endorsed definition of antisemitism by governmental bodies worldwide.

The institute believes that the IHRA definition is a repressive tool Ã¢Â€Âœused to smear, defund, and in some cases criminalize those who oppose racism, colonialism, and genocide, and those who speak up for Palestinian voices and rights,Ã¢Â€Â and that Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist and other right-wing forcesÃ¢Â€Â working for wider adoption of the IHRA definition are using Ã¢Â€Âœspurious antisemitism chargesÃ¢Â€Â as an excuse to crack down on critics.

The ICSZÃ¢Â€Â™s inaugural conference, held within days of the Hamas-led October 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, centered around combatting the IHRA definition and promoting a toolkit that advocates for its rejection. The conference, titled Ã¢Â€ÂœBattling the Ã¢Â€Â˜IHRA definition [of Antisemitism]Ã¢Â€Â™: Theory & Activism Conference,Ã¢Â€Â took place on October 13-14, 2023, simultaneously at UC Santa Cruz's Center for Racial Justice and NYU.

The event served as the launchpad for the ICSZ, months after its creation was first announced in August 2023 in the anti-Zionist publication Mondoweiss.

The institute initially solicited donations to cover the costs of the conference via the Venmo account of the WESPAC Foundation, a non-profit group that supports and administers funds for anti-Zionist and anti-Israel groups and those aligned with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.

Notably, the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI) -- part of the BDS movement in which the ICSZ participates -- co-sponsored the conference, as did other anti-Zionist groups including the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) and JVP.

Three USACBI members sit on the ICSZÃ¢Â€Â™s advisory board. Two longtime JVP leaders are also on the board and a JVP managing director is listed as a past member.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Every year, individuals with ties to different extreme causes and movements kill people in the United States; the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) tracks these murders. Extremists regularly commit murders in the service of their ideology, to further a group or gang they may belong to, or even while engaging in traditional, non-ideological criminal activities.
In 2023, domestic extremists killed at least 17 people in the U.S., in seven separate incidents. This represents a sharp decrease from the 27 extremist-related murders ADL has documented for 2022Ã¢Â€Â”which itself was a decrease from the 35 identified in 2021. It continues a trend of fewer extremist-related killings after a five-year span of 47-79 extremist-related murders per year (2015-2019). One reason for the trend is the decrease in recent years of extremist-related killings by domestic Islamist extremists and left-wing extremists.
The 2023 murder totals include two extremist-related shootings sprees, both by white supremacists, which together accounted for 11 of the 17 deaths. A third shooting spree, also by an apparent white supremacist, wounded several people but luckily did not result in fatalities.
All the extremist-related murders in 2023 were committed by right-wing extremists of various kinds, with 15 of the 17 killings involving perpetrators or accomplices with white supremacist connections. This is the second year in a row that right-wing extremists have been connected to all identified extremist-related killings.
Two of the incidents from 2023 involved women playing some role in the killing or its aftermath. This report includes a special section that examines the role played by women in deadly extremist violence in the United States by analyzing 50 incidents from the past 20 years in which women were involved in some fashion in extremist-related killings.",[6],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.8}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/hate-no-game-hate-and-harassment-online-games-2023,"Executive Summary

Hate and harassment in gaming is now so pervasive that it has become the norm for many players. An estimated 83 million of the 110 million online multiplayer gamers in the U.S. were exposed to hate and harassment over the last six months. Three out of four young people (ages 10-17) experience harassment when playing video games. And it continues to grow and spread across generations of gamers, despite some movement toward countering extremism and a growing trend of more aggressively tackling voice chat moderation alongside the beginnings of transparency efforts by major companies. When players pick up their phones or sit down at their PC or console, they now expect to experience hate- antisemitism, racism, misogyny, homophobia and more on a regular basis.

In an interview with a researcher from the ADL Center for Technology and Society, an adult gamer described how he responded to his son experiencing a painful incident of hate in an online multiplayer game:

Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â™That's how it is, you know?Ã¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Â™ I try to teach them young, Ã¢Â€Â˜cause Ã¢Â€Â¦ Now he wants to be a gamer, I have to teach him how it goes.Ã¢Â€Â

Normalized harassment and desensitization to hate frame the reality we find in ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s fifth annual survey of hate and harassment in online multiplayer games. And thisÃ¢Â€Â”coupled with new trends in exposure to white supremacist extremism in online multiplayer games, including potential evidence of white supremacist recruitmentÃ¢Â€Â” create an urgent challenge for the future of online multiplayer games that must be addressed by all stakeholders, from industry and government, to civil society and the broader public.

Key findings:

Young people experienced more harassment this year. Three-quarters of teens and pre-teens experienced harassment in online multiplayer games in 2023, up from 67 percent in the previous year. Harassment of 10Ã¢Â€Â“17-year-olds based on identity increased to 37 percent from 29 percent in 2022. Ã‚Â 
Women and Black or African American gamers were the most harassed because of their identity in online multiplayer games.Ã‚Â In every previous survey, women have been the group who far and away experienced the most harassment due to their identity in these spaces. Women saw a one-point increase to 48 percent of gamers harassed because of their gender. Ã‚Â 
Half of Black adult gamers (50 percent) reported experiencing harassment in online games due to their race, an increase from 44 percent in 2022. This represents a 19-point increase in hate targeting Black adult gamers since 2020, when many game companies spoke out in support of Black Lives Matter following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Though still far too high,Ã‚Â theÃ‚Â overallÃ‚Â rateÃ‚Â of harassmentÃ‚Â of adults in online multiplayer games decreased for the first time in the five years this survey has been conducted.Ã‚Â 76 percent of adults experience harassment in games, down from 86 percent in 2022.
70 percent of Jewish adults experiencedÃ‚Â some form of harassment in online multiplayer games, though this data was collected before the 10/7 attack. This is 6 points less than adult gamers overall (76%).
Exposure toÃ‚Â white supremacist ideologiesÃ‚Â in online games decreased:Ã‚Â Nine percent of young people were exposed to white supremacy in 2023, compared to 15 percent in 2022. And 15 percent of adults were exposed to white supremacy in 2023, compared to 20 percent in 2022.Ã‚Â 
Despite a decrease in overall exposure to white supremacy, players exposed to this content see it regularly. 30% of adults and teens exposed to hateful and dangerous ideologies had these experiences on a weekly or more frequent basis.
20% of players (adults and teens) are spending less money in online game spaces because of the hate and harassment they encounter. This year for the first time CTS evaluated the influence of hate and harassment on how players spend their money in online multiplayer games.","[1, 3]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.4}",HIGH

The TOV Awards, whose name reflects the Hebrew word for Ã¢Â€Âœgood,Ã¢Â€Â were created to annually recognize and honor 18 companies that rank highly and outperform peer companies according to JLensÃ¢Â€Â™ Jewish values scorecards.

The 18 TOV Awards recipients were selected based on JLensÃ¢Â€Â™ proprietary scorecards, which measure the companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ performance in Combating Antisemitism & Hate, Support for Israel, and Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World).

To be eligible, companies must be included in the JLens 500 Jewish Advocacy U.S. Index, which is composed of most of the 500 largest U.S. public companies. The scorecards are informed by robust data collection, in-depth research, and direct engagement with companies.

Ã¢Â€ÂœIt is truly gratifying to be able to recognize the positive contributions of major U.S. corporations in supporting Jewish values, especially at a time of rising antisemitic activity, aggressive anti-Israel campaigns, and a pervasive atmosphere of intolerance,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of ADL. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe applaud the TOV Award recipients and hope that they will serve as role models of respect, tolerance and compassion for their peer companies.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â 

""JLens uniquely researches corporate behavior on issues important to the Jewish community, annually collecting over 30,000 data points on companies, and uses this analysis to guide our advocacy,"" said Ari Hoffnung, JLens Managing Director.

Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Index considers JLensÃ¢Â€Â™ Jewish Value Pillars in its index methodology and may exclude otherwise profitable investments in companies which have been identified as being in conflict with JLensÃ¢Â€Â™ Jewish Value Pillars. The Fund is not actively managed, and the Adviser will not sell any investments due to current or projected underperformance of the securities, industries or sector in which it invests, unless the investment is removed from the Index, sold in connection with a rebalancing of the Index as addressed in the Index methodology, or sold to comply with the FundÃ¢Â€Â™s investment limitations.

Ã‚Â 

Large-Capitalization Companies Risk: Large- capitalization companies may trail the returns of the overall stock market. Large capitalization stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better Ã¢Â€Â“ or worse Ã¢Â€Â“ than the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. When large capitalization companies are out of favor, these securities may lose value or may not appreciate in line with the overall market. In addition, large capitalization companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges, such as changes in technology or consumer tastes, and also may not be able to attain the high growth rate of successful small companies, especially during extended periods of economic expansion.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitism-arab-cartoons-during-israel-hamas-war-chronology-dehumanization-jews,"The October 7 Hamas massacre was the deadliest single attack against Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas terrorists raided dozens of Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip, using paragliders, motorcycles and SUVs, and murdered over 1,200 people, taking more than 240 people hostage. At least 130 remain in captivity.

In response, Israel launched a massive military campaign in Gaza aimed at eradicating the threat posed by Hamas and other terrorists and bringing home the hostages.

Alongside the outpouring of international support for Israel, there has been a surge in antisemitism and hateful anti-Israel rhetoric around the world, including in the Middle East.

This report focuses on political cartoons from numerous news sites across the Middle East, as well as UK-based Arabic-language ones, which include antisemitic and harsh anti-Israel themes focused on IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s response to the Oct. 7th massacre. They invoke antisemitic tropes, including the claim that Israel and Jews control US politics, Western media, and the international community. They reference Holocaust and other Nazi analogies, including comparing IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s prime minister to Hitler, the current war to the Holocaust, and Gaza to an extermination camp. Jewish religious symbols Ã¢Â€Â“ specifically the Jewish Menorah Ã¢Â€Â“ are often depicted as weapons, Israel is dehumanized and demonized through depictions of animals (more on this here), and the age-old blood libel charge is resurfaced against Israel.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/right-wing-extremist-terrorism-united-states,"Executive Summary
Right-wing extremist terror incidents in the U.S. have been increasing since the mid-2000s, but the past six years have seen their sharpest rise yet. There were just seven right-wing terror incidents in the period 2005-2007, but by 2017-2019 there were 27, which increased to 40 in 2020-2022.
The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Center on Extremism (COE) has documented 67 domestic terror incidents by right-wing extremists in the United States from 2017 to 2022.Ã‚Â  These include successful terrorist attacks, failed terrorist attacks and foiled terrorist plots.
White supremacists were responsible for more attacks than any other type of right-wing extremist in the past six years (30 of 67, or 45%), but anti-government extremists, anti-abortion extremists and other types of right-wing extremists have also plotted and carried out attacks.
Right-wing terror attacks during this period also resulted in more deaths (58) from such attacks than any of the previous six-year periods since the time of the Oklahoma City bombing. All but five of those deaths occurred in white supremacist attacksÃ¢Â€Â”primarily mass shootings directed against minority targets.
Most incidents (72%) involved only a single perpetrator, whether an arsonist targeting an abortion clinic or a white supremacist shooter targeting a synagogue. Single perpetrators were also far more likely to successfully carry out attacks; plots with multiple perpetrators were usually stopped by law enforcement. Most incidents were not committed by organized extremist groups.
Firearms were the most popular weapon chosen for attacks (27 of 67 incidents, or 40%, not counting two additional incidents where firearms were one of two weapon types). Incendiary devices (featured in 25% of incidents) were also popular, followed by explosive devices (18%).
Right-wing terrorists considered a wide array of targets. Government targets were most frequently chosen by perpetrators (in 18 of 67, or 27% of incidents), closely followed by targets based on actual or perceived religion (17 of 67, or 25%), which consisted of Muslims and Jews. Abortion-related targets and targets based on race (primarily Black people) were also common, at nine and eight, respectively (13% and 12%).",[6],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.8}",HIGH

On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists invaded Israel from Gaza, brutally killing more than 1400 people, and kidnapping over 240 children, men and women, provoking a war between Israel and Hamas. ADL has since observed a massive rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States and around the globe along with the proliferation of inflammatory language, misinformation about the conflict, and hateful content online.

As antisemitic incidents have increased, we sought to better understand if and how the publicÃ¢Â€Â™s views about the prevalence and severity of antisemitism in the United States compared to before the war and the spike in antisemitic incidents.We conducted a nationally representative poll asking the same questions about peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s perceptions of antisemitism that we asked approximately a year ago to determine how the war between Israel and Hamas has affected AmericansÃ¢Â€Â™ awareness of antisemitism.","[1, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",MEDIUM

In May 2023, a man outraged over abortion rights set his sights on a building in Danville, Illinois, that was slated to become a clinic offering womenÃ¢Â€Â™s health services, including abortions. The man, Philip Buyno of Prophetstown, allegedly filled containers with gasoline and loaded them into his car. His alleged efforts to destroy the clinic Ã¢Â€Â“ by ramming his car into the building and throwing a gas can into the space Ã¢Â€Â“ failed, and he was arrested. He later told the FBI heÃ¢Â€Â™d Ã¢Â€Âœfinish the jobÃ¢Â€Â if given the chance.

Buyno was an extremist, intent on attacking his perceived enemy no matter the cost. Over the past several years, Americans have witnessed a barrage of extremist activity: attacks on our democratic institutions, antisemitic incidents, white supremacist propaganda efforts, vicious, racially motivated attacks, bias crimes against the LGBTQ+ community and violent threats to womenÃ¢Â€Â™s healthcare providers. Ã‚Â 

Illinoisians have watched these same hatreds Ã¢Â€Â“ and more Ã¢Â€Â“ manifest in their own state.

This report explores a range of extremist groups and movements operating in Illinois and highlights the key extremist and antisemitic trends and incidents in the state in 2021 and 2022. It also includes noteworthy events and incidents from the first half of 2023. Ã‚Â 

There is no single narrative that tells the story of extremism and hate in Illinois. Instead, the impact is widespread and touches many communities. As in the rest of the country, both white supremacist and antisemitic activity have increased significantly over the last two years, but thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not the whole story. Ã‚Â 

The Prairie State is also home to a sizeable number of current and former law enforcement officers who have at one point belonged to or associated with extremist organizations or movements.

Since the start of 2021, Texas has experienced a significant amount of extremist activity. One driver of this phenomenon is Patriot Front, a white supremacist group that has distributed propaganda across Texas Ã¢Â€Â“ and the rest of the U.S. Ã¢Â€Â“ with alarming frequency, using the state as a base of operations. Two other factors are extremists who continue to target the LGBTQ+ community and QAnon supporters who have gathered for conferences and rallies across the state.

Texas has also seen a significant increase in antisemitic incidents over the last two years. It recorded the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s fifth-highest number of antisemitic incidents in 2022, at a time when ADL has tracked the highest-ever number of antisemitic incidents nationwide. Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/hate-parties-sharing-links-fringe-platforms-drives-antisemitic-comments-youtube,"The attention given to online hate and harassment tends to focus on direct, explicit attacks against targets. But another aspect of online hate gets less consideration: How hate purveyors praise and amplify each otherÃ¢Â€Â™s hateful content within and across different platforms.Ã‚Â 

An investigation from the ADL Center for Technology & Society (CTS) has found antisemitic comments spiked on some YouTube videos within 48 hours of their links being shared on a fringe platform. This spawned what we are calling Ã¢Â€Âœhate partiesÃ¢Â€Â: comments and replies that promoted antisemitic tropes, conspiracy theories, and hateful worldviews that, as ADL has documented, can inspire offline incidents. While online hate is often understood to be motivated by a desire to antagonize or disrupt specific targets, hate parties are focused less on short-term, antagonistic goals and more on spreading and promoting hate on mainstream platforms that can reach a relatively large audience, and on connecting with others who share similar perspectives.Ã‚Â 

YouTube has a strict policy against hate speechÃ¢Â€Â”including comments left on videosÃ¢Â€Â”that it enforces through content removal, demonetization, or suspension. But YouTube links shared to fringe social media platforms whose content moderation rules are lax or nonexistent drive traffic back to YouTube, where antisemitism that should violate the platformÃ¢Â€Â™s rules thrives in video comment sections. Online hate purveyors maintain presences in multiple social spaces and often fall into call-and-response patterns between professional influencers and rank-and-file followers that extend hateful conversations across platforms. Sharing video links keeps the fringes tethered to YouTube and enables hateful conversations to extend across platforms.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

CTS collected comment data from YouTube videos whose links were posted to different fringe platforms such as 4chan, Gab, Gettr, Telegram, and Truth Social (see Methods). We observed an average 17.98% increase in antisemitic comments within 48 hours of a videoÃ¢Â€Â™s link being shared to a fringe platform. Such comments included Great Replacement theory talking points and implicit Holocaust denial. While it is possible the users leaving antisemitic comments are not the same as those who followed the link from a fringe site, the spike patterns show a significant correlation between link-sharing and increased antisemitism on YouTube.Ã‚Â 

CTS has previously written about the phenomenon of Ã¢Â€Âœstochastic harassmentÃ¢Â€Â and hate on Twitter, or how influential accounts act as nodes for hate and harassment even when not explicitly directing their followers to take any action. All social media platforms are vulnerable to stochastic hate and harassment, and none currently have effective policies for proactively addressing how hate and harassment are networked. It is unclear why YouTube is not fully enforcing its hate speech policy against the comments we observed attached to the videos for this study, but this is one more example of why current content moderation approaches are inadequate to fully address how hate and harassment work on social media.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Combating hate parties and their associated harms will require YouTube to alter its approach to content moderation. To effectively enforce its rules against hate speech, YouTube would need to account for how its services are embedded in broader online hate conversations unfolding across different platforms. Such an approach would need to include monitoring where and when inbound traffic originating from fringe platforms leads to increased rates of hate speech on known problematic channels; and proactively quarantining or disabling comment sections on certain videos.Ã‚Â

How YouTube Comment Sections Turn Into Hate Parties
Ã¢Â€Â‹Ã¢Â€Â‹Ã¢Â€Â‹Far-right conspiracy theorist Mark Dice runs a popular YouTube channel with over 1.86 million subscribers. On January 2, 2023, Dice uploaded a video titled Ã¢Â€ÂœHollywoodÃ¢Â€Â™s Problem with White People,Ã¢Â€Â in which he criticized celebrities and social media users for discussing racial inequality in Hollywood. Toward the end of the video, Dice stated, Ã¢Â€ÂœNone of [these celebrities] would ever commit the cardinal sin of the entertainment industry by asking about another certain group or their influence; everyone knows that would kill their career overnight,Ã¢Â€Â a clear antisemitic dog whistle to conspiracy theories about Jewish control of entertainment media. As of August 1, 2023, the video had received almost 200,000 views, more than 32,000 likes, and over 7,000 comments, 3% of which scored high for antisemitism.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

On the same day that he uploaded the video to his YouTube channel, links to DiceÃ¢Â€Â™s video were shared six times on Gab, nineteen times on Gettr, once on 4chan, and twice on Truth Social, among others. Antisemitic comments flooded in almost immediately on YouTube, as the chart above shows.Ã‚Â 

The comments quickly snowballed into a hate-laced discussion against Jews, with numerous commenters piling on antisemitic innuendo. Several picked up on DiceÃ¢Â€Â™s dog whistle and used coded language for Jews, such as Ã¢Â€Âœjuice,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœJÃ¢Â€Â™s,Ã¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœj.w,Ã¢Â€Â1 likely to avoid automated detection. Some called attention to the veiled reference, e.g., Ã¢Â€ÂœWe ALL know the certain group Mark is referring to here,Ã¢Â€Â while others criticized Dice for not being explicit enoughÃ¢Â€Â” Ã¢Â€ÂœMark youÃ¢Â€Â™re almost there just name (((them))),Ã¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœ(((HOLLYWOOD))) Name them Mark or dont even botherÃ¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Â”using the triple parentheses Ã¢Â€ÂœechoÃ¢Â€Â that antisemites use to indicate someone or something is Jewish and urging him to Ã¢Â€Âœname the Jew,Ã¢Â€Â a common antisemitic slogan.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

YouTube commentersÃ¢Â€Â™ demands for Dice to Ã¢Â€Âœname the JewÃ¢Â€Â mirrored conversations happening on fringe platforms where the videoÃ¢Â€Â™s link had been shared. One Gab user posted a screenshot of an antisemitic thread in the videoÃ¢Â€Â™s comment section as evidence of DiceÃ¢Â€Â™s impact on YouTube, while noting that he stopped short of naming the Jew:Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

The comment section on DiceÃ¢Â€Â™s YouTube channel was not meaningfully different from explicitly hateful threads on fringe platforms, such as similar rhetoric on 4chanÃ¢Â€Â™s Politically Incorrect, or /pol/, board. In a thread linking to the video, anonymous users debated if Dice adequately addressed Ã¢Â€Âœthe JQÃ¢Â€Â (or Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish questionÃ¢Â€Â) in his videos, something that is often seen as a litmus test for antisemites. Though they disagreed with his tactics, two users acknowledged that Dice was an important voice on YouTube and sympathetic to their worldview. Ã¢Â€ÂœHeÃ¢Â€Â™s just another person helping people along the path,Ã¢Â€Â one wrote, while another added, Ã¢Â€ÂœHonestly im very surprised mark hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t been deplatformed truly.Ã¢Â€Â Statements like these illustrate how antisemitic users on fringe platforms view YouTube channels like DiceÃ¢Â€Â™s as places to gather for hate parties, reinforcing and uplifting their hateful worldviews.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Leather Apron Club is another YouTube channel where comment sections turn into antisemitic hate parties. The channelÃ¢Â€Â™s operator is not a well-known media influencer; CTS found he sometimes goes by Ã¢Â€ÂœAlexÃ¢Â€Â when being interviewed by other far-right figuresÃ¢Â€Â”including antisemitic YouTuber Keith Woods and Australian neo-Nazi Joel DavisÃ¢Â€Â”but has no way of verifying if thatÃ¢Â€Â™s his real name or any additional biographical information about him. Even so, Leather Apron Club has been able to amass more than 60,000 subscribers and over 2.3 million total views since its launch in 2021. The content Leather Apron Club posts is more explicitly antisemitic than DiceÃ¢Â€Â™s, including a video uploaded on October 24, 2022, titled Ã¢Â€ÂœHigh Jewish IQ Debunked - Joe Rogan Followup.Ã¢Â€Â As of August 1, 2023, the video had more than 227,000 views, over 15,000 likes, and over 5,000 comments, 12% of which scored high for antisemitism.Ã‚Â 

In the video, the host reviewed academic publications about IQ scores and race, argued that Jews were overrepresented in media, and insinuated that Jews were an outsider group that had usurped political power in the United States and did not have the best interests of Americans in mind. YouTubeÃ¢Â€Â™s hate speech policy prohibits Ã¢Â€Âœconspiracy theories saying individuals or groups are evil, corrupt, or maliciousÃ¢Â€Â based on race, ethnicity, or religion, which could be seen as applying to Leather Apron ClubÃ¢Â€Â™s video. CTS reported the video and channel, but YouTube determined neither violated its hate speech policy.Ã‚Â 

We found links to the Ã¢Â€ÂœHigh Jewish IQ DebunkedÃ¢Â€Â video shared extensively on three fringe platforms: Telegram (38 times), Gab (42 times), and 4chan (254 times). Antisemitic comments spiked several times on the video, most of which correlated with its link being shared to fringe platforms (see chart above).Ã‚Â 

One of the top comments, with over 2,000 likes, made it clear that the hostÃ¢Â€Â™s antisemitic message was being received by his audience: Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is naming and noticing at an astonishing level. This guy needs a Nobel Prize for NoticingÃ¢Â€Â (antisemites commonly use the hashtag Ã¢Â€Âœ#TheNoticingÃ¢Â€Â to signal to one another online that they are Ã¢Â€ÂœnoticingÃ¢Â€Â alleged Jewish control). As with DiceÃ¢Â€Â™s video, many commenters used coded language and implicit references to communicate antisemitic sentiments, such as: Ã¢Â€ÂœSynagogue of satan,Ã¢Â€Â a reference to lines in Revelation 2:9 and 3:9 in the Christian Bible that antisemites often quote to one another; Ã¢Â€ÂœSHUT IT DOWN the goyim know,Ã¢Â€Â a common phrase that communicates beliefs about a secretive Jewish cabal controlling power from behind the scenes; and Ã¢Â€Âœ[Jordan] Peterson is a j3w shill,Ã¢Â€Â using the number Ã¢Â€Âœ3Ã¢Â€Â in place of Ã¢Â€ÂœeÃ¢Â€Â to avoid detection.Ã‚Â 

The antisemitic comments on Leather Apron ClubÃ¢Â€Â™s video and those in fringe platform threads discussing his video were so closely intertwined that they appeared almost like parts of one cohesive, shared conversation: a hate party moving locations around social media. For example, YouTube commenters referenced retired professor and antisemite Kevin MacDonald and white supremacist Jared Taylor as writers who have made similar claims about IQ and Jews in their work. A Telegram user who linked to Leather Apron ClubÃ¢Â€Â™s video wrote, Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish high IQ is an objective fact Ã¢Â€Â¦ That alone explains a huge (though not all) amount of Jewish power and influence Ã¢Â€Â¦ [All this] is supported by other figures such as Kevin MacDonald,Ã¢Â€Â while on Gab a user replied to a post linking to the video, Ã¢Â€ÂœYeah, about that IQ. Even people like @JaredTaylor repeat that stuff but itÃ¢Â€Â™s complete bullshit.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Time to End the Party

While YouTube has a mixed record on combating the spread of antisemitism on its platform broadly, this study shows that it is falling short on moderating comments. Many of the comments CTS analyzed appear to fall squarely under YouTubeÃ¢Â€Â™s definition of hate speech: Ã¢Â€ÂœContent promoting Ã¢Â€Â¦ hatred against individuals or groups based on [protected] attributes.Ã¢Â€Â Interestingly, YouTube does have a policy that prohibits channels from including links in their video descriptions to sites with content that would violate YouTubeÃ¢Â€Â™s own hate and harassment policies. But there is no policy regarding how to treat videos shared to those same sites, even when that leads to inbound traffic that amplifies hate on YouTube.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

To moderate hate speech on its platform, YouTube should proactively monitor how link referrals affect inbound web traffic to channels that foster hate parties. Researchers have proposed an automated monitoring tool that predicts the likelihood of a video being targeted by a hate raid, i.e., coordinated efforts to attack and disrupt a target, allowing YouTube to work to disable or quarantine comments proactively. A similar solution could work for proactively identifying and quarantining videos likely to attract hate parties by analyzing past comments and inbound web traffic for known problematic channels like Mark DiceÃ¢Â€Â™s or Leather Apron Club.Ã‚Â 

Commenter activity is often outside of a channelÃ¢Â€Â™s controlÃ¢Â€Â”for example, those targeted by hate raidsÃ¢Â€Â”and channel operators should not bear the sole responsibility for combating hateful comments. Yet some channels, like the ones in our study, implicitly welcome hateful engagement and make space for hate in their comment sections. Leather Apron ClubÃ¢Â€Â™s operator has explained in interviews how he strategically avoids posting content that will trigger a strike from YouTube but will nevertheless get his antisemitic messaging across to his audience effectively. In other words, YouTubeÃ¢Â€Â™s content moderation rules are often ineffective for channels like Leather Apron Club because the words they use are less important than the service they provide for spreading hate. Those channelsÃ¢Â€Â™ goals are making space for hate and strengthening social ties among hate purveyors, not making explicit threats or directly calling for violence.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

ADL has long advocated for larger structural changes to the incentives of the social media ecosystem, such as reforming the surveillance advertising business model, that would beÃ‚Â  required to truly protect users from online hate and harassment. But YouTube could act now to enforce its rules against these hate parties by enacting the above-proposed solutions, all of which are both technically feasible and would create a safer, less hate-filled experience for users of the platform.Ã‚Â 

Methods
CTS used the Social Media Analysis Toolkit (SMAT)Ã¢Â€Â”an open-source platform for researching harmful online trendsÃ¢Â€Â”to query posts or messages containing YouTube URLs. We restricted our search from December 24, 2022, to January 24, 2023, and collected data from the following fringe platforms: 4chan, 8kun, Bitchute, Gab, Gettr, LBRY, MeWe, Minds, Parler, Poal, Rumble, Telegram, Truth Social, Wimkin, and Win. We found over 385,000 messages with at least one YouTube link. We narrowed our focus to analyze only videos whose links were shared to at least three fringe platforms, resulting in 1862 unique videos. 1389 of those videos were still on YouTube after we completed the initial data analysis, of which 1205 had at least one comment (the other 184 may have disabled comments or did not attract much engagement). We did not selectively sample videos or channels based on political affiliation or ideology.Ã‚Â 

We used the YouTube data API to collect all of the comments for the sample of 1205 videos. We then used ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Online Hate Index (OHI), a machine learning classifier trained to identify antisemitic content. We analyzed the comments and assigned them a score indicating the likelihood they were antisemitic. The highest possible score on the OHI is 1.0, indicating a high level of confidence that the content is antisemitic. We included all comments that received a score of 0.9 or higher in our analysis. By applying this high threshold, we likely underestimated the prevalence of antisemitism in the comments.Ã‚Â 

To determine whether link-sharing had any possible effect on a spike in antisemitic comments on a YouTube video, we considered the following criteria:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Comments had to be posted within 48 hours of the link being shared to a fringe platform.Ã‚Â 

There must have been a minimum of two antisemitic comments posted during the 48-hour period.Ã‚Â 

Spikes had to align with peaks detected using the signal module in the SciPy Python library, as detailed here.Ã‚Â 

526 videos met these criteria. We then tallied the number of antisemitic comments for each of the 526 videos left between December 24, 2022, and January 24, 2023, and identified 22 videos with more than 50 antisemitic comments and manually reviewed them. Using SMAT, we searched for every instance of a link to those 22 videos being shared to fringe platforms and analyzed the comments users made on posts that shared the link. This allowed us to compare the details of conversations on fringe platforms with comments on YouTube videos.","[2, 5, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.1, 5: 0.7, 6: 0.9}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/bad-worse-amplification-and-auto-generation-hate,"The question of who is accountable for the proliferation of antisemitism, hate, and extremism online has been hotly debated for years. Are our digital feeds really a reflection of society, or do social media platforms and tech companies actually exacerbate virulent content themselves? The companies argue that users are primarily responsible for the corrosive content soaring to the top of news feeds and reverberating between platforms. This argument serves to absolve these multi-billion-dollar companies from responsibility for any role their own products play in exacerbating hate.

A new pair of studies from ADL and TTP (Tech Transparency Project) show how some of the biggest social media platforms and search engines at times directly contribute to the proliferation of online antisemitism, hate, and extremism through their own tools and, in some cases, by creating content themselves. While there are many variables contributing to online hate, including individual usersÃ¢Â€Â™ own behavior, our research demonstrates how these companies are taking things from bad to worse.

For these studies, we created male, female, and teen personas (without a specified gender) who searched for a basket of terms related to conspiracy theories as well as popular internet personalities, commentators, and video games across four of the biggest social media platforms, to test how these companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ algorithms would work. In the first study, three of four platforms recommended even more extreme, contemptuously antisemitic, and hateful content. One platform, YouTube, did not take the bait. It was responsive to the persona but resisted recommending antisemitic and extremist content, proving that it is not just a problem of scale or capability.

In our second study, we tested search functions at three companies, all of which made finding hateful content and groups a frictionless experience, by autocompleting terms and, in some cases, even auto-generating content to fill in hate data voids. Notably, the companies didnÃ¢Â€Â™t autocomplete terms or auto-generate content for other forms of offensive content, such as pornography, proving, again, that this is not just a problem of scale or capability.

What these investigations ultimately revealed is that tech companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ hands arenÃ¢Â€Â™t tied. Companies have a choice in what to prioritize, including when it comes to tuning algorithms and refining design features to either exacerbate or help curb antisemitism and extremism.

As debates rage between legislators, regulators, and judges on AI, platform transparency, and intermediary liability, these investigations underscore the urgency for both platforms and governments to do more. Based on our findings, here are three recommendations for industry and government:

Tech companies need to fix the product features that currently escalate antisemitism and auto-generate hate and extremism. Tech companies should tune their algorithms and recommendation engines to ensure they are not leading users down paths riddled with hate and antisemitism. They should also improve predictive autocomplete features and stop auto-generation of hate and antisemitism altogether.
Ã‚Â 
Congress must update Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to fit the reality of todayÃ¢Â€Â™s internet. Section 230 was enacted before social media and search platforms as we know them existed, yet it continues to be interpreted to provide those platforms with near-blanket legal immunity for online content, even when their own tools are exacerbating hate, harassment and extremism. We believe that by updating Section 230 to better define what type of online activity should remain covered and what type of platform behavior should not, we can help ensure that social media platforms more proactively address how recommendation engines and surveillance advertising practices are exacerbating hate and extremism, which leads to online harms and potential offline violence. With the advent of social media, the use of algorithms, and the surge of artificial intelligence, tech companies are more than merely static hosting services. When there is a legitimate claim that a tech company played a role in enabling hate crimes, civil rights violations, or acts of terror, victims deserve their day in court.
Ã‚Â 
We need more transparency. Users deserve to know how platform recommendation engines work. This does not need to be a trade secret-revealing exercise, but tech companies should be transparent with users about what they are seeing and why. The government also has a role to play. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen some success on this front in California, where transparency legislation was passed in 2022. Still, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s more to do. Congress must pass federal transparency legislation so that stakeholders (the public, researchers, and civil society) have access to the information necessary to truly evaluate how tech companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ own tools, design practices, and business decisions impact society.

Hate is on the rise. Antisemitism both online and offline is becoming normalized. A politically charged U.S. presidential election is already under way. This is a pressure cooker we cannot afford to ignore, and tech companies need to take accountability for their role in the ecosystem.

Whether you work in government or industry, are a concerned digital citizen, or a tech advocate, we hope you find this pair of reports to be informative. There is no single fix to the scourge of online hate and antisemitism, but we can and must do more to create a safer and less hate-filled internet.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitism-and-radical-anti-israel-bias-political-left-europe,"Introduction

Antisemitism is global and multifaceted.Ã‚Â  One area in which ADL has seen a growth of antisemitism is within elements of the political left. This often takes the form of anti-Zionism, a movement that rejects the Jewish right to self-determination and of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, and frequently employs antisemitic tropes to attack Israel and its supporters. It also manifests through the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a campaign that promotes diplomatic, financial, professional, academic and cultural isolation of Israel, Israeli individuals, Israeli institutions, and Jews who support IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s right to exist.

Political actors and advocacy movements associated with some left-wing political organizations have engaged in such antisemitism both in the U.S. and in Europe. While antisemitism from individuals associated with left-leaning political organizations is generally less violent than right-wing antisemitism, its penetration into the political mainstream is cause for concern and has in some cases alienated Jews and other supporters of Israel.Ã‚Â  Concerns are both political and physical.Ã‚Â  As described in this report, Jews and Jewish institutions have been targeted and have suffered violent attacks, associated with anti-Zionism, often in the wake of fighting between Israel and the Palestinians, most recently in 2021.

The challenges facing Jewish communities in Europe can be a bellwether for what is to come for the U.S. Jewish community, as evidenced for example by the recent rise in violent antisemitism in the U.S., which has plagued European Jewish communities for many years, and the increase in anti-Zionism in U.S. progressive spaces, something that has existed in Europe for some time. To better understand this phenomenon in Europe, ADL asked partners in the UK, France, Germany and Spain to describe some of the expressions of left-wing political antisemitism and anti-Israel bias in their countries. The individual contributors are responsible for the content of those chapters and their positions may differ with standard ADL practice and/or policy.

Our British partner, the Community Security Trust, is the British Jewish communityÃ¢Â€Â™s security agency, which monitors, reports on, and educates about antisemitism among other vital tasks for the safety and security of the Jewish community.

Our French partner, the politics and culture magazine Ã¢Â€ÂœK., The Jews, Europe, the 21st Century,Ã¢Â€Â reports on contemporary challenges and opportunities for Jewish life in France and elsewhere in Europe.

Our German partner, Amadeu Antonio Foundation, is one of Germany's foremost independent non-governmental organizations working to strengthen democratic civil society and eliminate extremism, antisemitism, racism and other forms of bigotry and hate.

Our Spanish partner, ACOM, is a non-denominational and independent organization that strengthens the relationship between Spain and Israel, and whose work is inspired by the defense of human rights, democratic societies, civil liberties and the rule of law.

Executive Summary

Online hate and harassment are atÃ‚Â record highs, but targets of hate continue to struggle to receive the support they need from social media companies. To evaluate how and whether people are being protected from online hate and harassment, ADL Center for Technology and Society (CTS) reviewed how nine tech companies currently support people targeted by these harmful and traumatizing experiences on their platforms.Ã¢Â€Â

CTS reviewed recommendations from PEN AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s report on social media abuse reporting (released in 2023),Ã‚Â  ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s social pattern library (released in 2022), UNESCO and ICFJÃ¢Â€Â™s study of online violence against women journalists (released in 2022), The World Wide Web Foundation report on Online Gender-Based Violence (released in 2021), PEN AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s report on platform mitigation features for theÃ‚Â  experience of targets of online harassment (released in 2021), ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s qualitative study of targets of online abuse (released in 2019), and thousands of responses from targets of online hate as reflected in the ADL Online Hate and Harassment surveys from 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Based on these reports, CTS compiled a list of eleven platform features necessary to protect targets of online hate, all of which were previously recommended in at least four of these resources. Each of these features is rooted in the experience of targets of online harassment and the ways targets wished they were supported when facing hate and harassment on social media.

Key Findings

None of the nine platforms analyzed have all eleven fundamental features so often requested by targets of online hate and harassment, as shown in research from ADL, PEN America, the World Wide Web Foundation, UNESCO, and ICFJ between 2019 and 2023.

Twitch received the highest score of any platform (B) for getting at least partial credit on ten out of eleven features.
Snapchat received the lowest grade (F) overall for having two out of eleven features.
Only three platformsÃ¢Â€Â”TikTok, Twitter (now X) and Twitch Ã¢Â€Â”allow batch reporting, the ability to flag multiple related comments or pieces of content simultaneously.
No platform offers the ability for a target of abuse to speak to a live person for support, regardless of the level of severity or urgency of abuse theyÃ¢Â€Â™re experiencing.
ADL recommends that platforms:

Center the experiences of people targeted by identity-based hate and harassment in the platform and product development and design- especially experiences of those disproportionately targeted for their identity.

Increase investments in trust and safety to prioritize improvements to the experience of targets on platforms.
Implement features such as those suggested in this report that will improve the user experience and support given to targets of online hate.
Utilize resources and expertise from civil society and academia, including those cited in this report card.

Over the past year, online hate and harassment rose sharply for adults and teens ages 13-17. Among adults, 52% reported being harassed online in their lifetime, the highest number we have seen in four years, up from 40% in 2022. Both adults and teens also reported being harassed within the past twelve months, up from 23% in 2022 to 33% in 2023 for adults and 36% to 51% for teens. Overall, reports of each type of hate and harassment increased by nearly every measure and within almost every demographic group.

ADL conducts this nationally representative survey annually to find out how many American adults experience hate or harassment on social media; since 2022, we have surveyed teens ages 13-17 as well. The 2023 survey was conducted in March and April 2023 and spans the preceding twelve months. Online hate and harassment remain persistent and entrenched problems on social media platforms.

Key Findings

Key Recommendations
Social media companies should enforce hate and harassment policies transparently, equitably, and at scale. This includes limiting high-profile user exceptions and other loopholes that make policies less effective.
Ã‚Â 
Social media companies should adopt and implement ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s recommended tools and anti-hate by design principles to support targets of harassment, such as allowing users to report multiple harmful comments at once (batch reporting), to enable trusted others to moderate their accounts (delegated access) and to report related activity.
Ã‚Â 
At the federal level, legislators should mandate transparency reporting and outlaw doxing. Additionally, regulators should increase consumer protection efforts to disincentivize harmful business practices.",[1],"{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.0}",HIGH

Over the last two years, extremist activity in Massachusetts has mirrored developments on the national stage. Like the rest of the country, Massachusetts has seen white supremacists Ã¢Â€Â“ including the Nationalist Social Club Ã¢Â€Â“ increasingly make their presence known. The Bay State has also reported extensive propaganda distribution efforts, especially by Patriot Front, which resulted in Massachusetts recording the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s second-highest number of white supremacist propaganda incidents in 2022.

Amidst increasing nationwide threats to the LGBTQ+ community, Massachusetts has also witnessed a spike in anti-LGBTQ+ activity, including waves of harassment against Boston ChildrenÃ¢Â€Â™s Hospital, drag performances and LGBTQ+ events. And as the numbers of antisemitic incidents continue to rise across the country, Massachusetts was no exception. According to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, it was the sixth most affected state in the country in 2022.

Over the past two years, California has dealt with a significant increase in extremist activity driven by a variety of factors, including increased collaboration between small white supremacist and antisemitic networks, as well as continued activity by extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and Rise Above Movement, particularly as they turned their attention toward the LGBTQ+ community. The state is home to the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s highest number of extremist-related murders and plots and has seen numerous incidents of political violence.

California has also seen a significant increase in antisemitic incidents over the last two years, becoming the state with the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s second-highest number of antisemitic incidents at a time when ADL tracked the highest-ever number of antisemitic incidents nationwide.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/2023-online-holocaust-denial-report-card,"Executive Summary

The problem: Holocaust deniers have used social media and game platforms to spread their virulent ideas and garner support. The Holocaust was the systematic murder of approximately six million Jews and several million others by the Nazis. It is one of historyÃ¢Â€Â™s most exhaustively documented and studied atrocities. Nevertheless, antisemites have tried to cast doubt on the facts of the Holocaust concerning Jewish victims. They claim that Jews fabricated evidence of their genocide to gain sympathy, extract reparations from Germany, and facilitate the alleged illegal acquisition of Palestinian land to create Israel.

What ADL studied: Following up on our 2021 report card, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Center for Technology & Society (CTS) assessed 10 major social media and game platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ stated policies and enforcement rates regarding content containing Holocaust denial (Facebook and Instagram are both owned by the same parent company, Meta, and were not counted separately.). Our 2023 investigation revealed that while most platforms will remove explicit Holocaust denial content for trusted flaggers such as ADL, they often do not act accordingly when the same content is reported by ordinary users.

How we did this report card: As in our 2021 report card, CTS reviewed platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ policies regarding Holocaust denial and looked for examples of such content. We then reported the Holocaust denial content, under the platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ anti-hate policies, from nonofficial accounts to see how platforms would enforce their policies for ordinary users. We also reported the content that had not been actioned via our trusted flagger relationships with the platforms (A trusted flagger is an organizational partner that can report content and get it prioritized on many platforms.). We then scored these platforms based on how they were managing Holocaust denial content in terms of policy and enforcement.

What is different from our 2021 report card: For our 2023 report card, we added three major online multiplayer games, where we found multiple usernames with Holocaust denial references: League of Legends (owned by Riot Games), Call of Duty (owned by Activision Blizzard), and Fortnite (owned by Epic Games). League of Legends was the only one of these game platforms that responded and took action when usernames were reported by an ordinary user.

Why this matters: This report card must be viewed in light of surges in online and offline antisemitism in recent years. In 2021, ADL found that the number of reports of assaults, vandalism, and harassment targeting Jewish communities and individuals in the United States was the highest on record since we began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979. Government officials have warned about the connection between online antisemitic content and offline violence.

Next steps: We urge platforms to be more proactive against Holocaust denial and to better inform users on what they are doing to curb hate. A list of CTSÃ¢Â€Â™ recommendations is at the end of this report.","[1, 2, 4, 5]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.9, 6: 0.0}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/caught-vicious-cycle-obstacles-and-opportunities-trust-and-safety-teams-games,"Executive Summary

How can the games industry reduce disruptive behavior and harmful conduct in online games?

These phenomena have become normalized in online games, and it is not only players but also industry employees who suffer.

Since 2019, ADL has conducted an annual survey of hate, harassment, and extremism in online multiplayer games. Our 2022 survey shows that hate continues unabated. More than four out of five adults (86%) ages 18-45 experienced harassment. In addition, more than three out of five young people ages 10-17 experienced harassment.

For this report, however, ADL decided to focus not on usersÃ¢Â€Â™ experiences but on the challenges faced by trust and safety employees in the games industry when it comes to moderating hate and harassment. ADL wanted to determine whether game companies prioritize content policy enforcement and whether they give staff adequate support. Building on our previous work, the ADL Center for Technology & Society analyzed the policy guidelines of 12 games and interviewed a number of trust and safety experts in the games and technology industries.Ã‚Â 

Our recommendations are:

Assign more resources to understaffed and overwhelmed trust and safety teams in game companies. Teams are bogged down by institutional challenges, explaining the value of content moderation to skeptical executives and securing bigger budgets to hire more staff and expand their work.
Make content moderation a priority in the creation and design of a game. Trust and safety experts say content moderation should be central from a gameÃ¢Â€Â™s conception to its discontinuation.
Focus content moderation on the toxic 1%. Networks, not individuals, spread toxicity. Game companies should identify clusters of users who disproportionately exhibit bad behavior instead of trying to catch and punish every rule-breaking individual. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Build community resilience. Positive content moderation tools work. Use social engineering strategies such as endorsement systems to incentivize positive play.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Use player reform strategies. Most players respond better to warnings than punitive measures.
Provide consistent feedback. When a player sends a report, send an automated thank you message. When a determination is made, tell the reporting player what action was taken. This not only shows players that the team is listening, but it also models positive behavior.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Avoid jargon and legalese in policy guidelines. These documents should be concise and easy for players to read. Every game should have a Code of Conduct and Terms of Service.

The games industry has reached an inflection point, with games acting as powerful vectors of harassment and radicalization. Regardless of age, users will likely experience abuse when they play.

Games function as entertainment and sources of community for millions of people. If the industry continues to deprioritize content moderation, it will send a clear message to users, especially marginalized groups, that games are not safe, welcoming spaces for all. We hope this report serves as constructive criticism for an industry that figures prominently in the American social and cultural landscape.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe CanÃ¢Â€Â™t Control User ActionÃ¢Â€Â

The value of trust and safety may be best illustrated by what happened after Twitter dissolved its Trust and Safety Council and made deep cuts to its trust and safety team. ADL found a 61% increase in antisemitic content on Twitter two weeks after Tesla CEO Elon Musk bought the company. Twitter lost half of its top 100 advertisers, with companies citing concerns about their brands being associated with inflammatory content on the platform.

The work of trust and safety teams is complex; they wrestle with many thorny issues: free speech, democracy, and privacy, among others. With respect to the games industry, teams do not have the resources they need to address toxicity. Games have exploded in popularity, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, but companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ trust and safety operations remain bare-bones. Moderation was once the simple process of preventing players from using offensive words. As games continue to evolve, overburdened teams must also moderate text, audio, and even custom game modes.

Recently, a user-created mode that simulates sexual assault appeared as one of the most popular modes in Overwatch 2. The mode enabled players to impregnate female characters in the game by knocking them down and forcing themselves on top of them. At the top of the screen, as reported by the publication PC Gamer, the mode said Ã¢Â€ÂœrapingÃ¢Â€Â¦Ã¢Â€Â until the female character was marked as Ã¢Â€Âœpregnant.Ã¢Â€Â Players could then wait for the baby to be born as the denouement of this appalling chain of events.

What the example of Overwatch 2 illustrates, aside from the blatant misogyny that continues to plague the games industry, is that current approaches to content moderation are ill-equipped to deal with the forms of harmful conduct players face. In the same article about the sexual-assault simulator found in Overwatch 2, PC Gamer reported, Ã¢Â€ÂœIt doesn't appear that BlizzardÃ¢Â€Â™s moderation tools automatically filter out those words from the title or description. You can report modes from their information pages for Ã¢Â€Â˜abusive custom game text,Ã¢Â€Â™ but Blizzard doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t let you type in an explanation like you can when reporting players.Ã¢Â€Â

As of the articleÃ¢Â€Â™s publication in January 2023, Activision Blizzard has not shared a plan for how it would prevent the simulator from reappearing in the game.

Even with supposed guardrails in place, violative content still reaches users. Roblox, for instance, filters games according to age, with those tagged as Ã¢Â€ÂœAll AgesÃ¢Â€Â deemed appropriate for children as young as five. Yet as one concerned parent whose children were Roblox users discovered, the filtering system exposed young players to disturbing content. It was easy for the parent, a games industry veteran, to circumvent RobloxÃ¢Â€Â™s moderation.

Ã¢Â€ÂœI initially started this experiment to talk about the aggressive use of microtransactions and pay-to-win mechanics that condition kids to the games-as-a-service model,Ã¢Â€Â the parent said. Ã¢Â€ÂœI didnÃ¢Â€Â™t expect to find weird pedo stuff and bathroom voyeur games and suicidal idealization.Ã¢Â€Â

After the parent shared her findings, the publication NME reported that a Roblox Corporation employee allegedly said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, we canÃ¢Â€Â™t control user action, we can only act on reports.Ã¢Â€Â

Unwittingly, the employee revealed much about the industryÃ¢Â€Â™s approach to content moderationÃ¢Â€Â”it is too reliant on being reactive rather than proactive. Removing harmful content after thousands of children have seen it, only for that content to sprout again, hardly indicates success.

It is time for game companies to rethink their content moderation strategies.

ADL analyzed the landscape of content moderation in the games industry. We analyzed the content moderation policies of 12 games and interviewed leading trust and safety experts in games and technology. To protect their identities, they were assigned the following pseudonyms:

Philip, the founder of a tech startup in the games industry
Jeremy, a user-experience designer at a game company
Shannon, the former head of a user-behavior department
Marina, a researcher at a major game company
Robert, a trust and safety executive at a large tech company

We sought to answer the following research questions:

What do trust and safety experts identify as the main obstacles to effective content moderation in online games?
Which strategies support robust content moderation?
What are examples of clear, comprehensive policy guidelines?
What are the best practices around cultivating positive play, what constitutes active moderation, and how can companies provide better player support?

Game companies cannot control usersÃ¢Â€Â™ actions, but they can influence their behavior and experience to a large degree. They can even decide which types of user behavior are prohibited and welcome in their games. Companies can create more-positive environments by not solely relying on punitive measures such as bans, which have limited efficacy. We hope this report expands the industryÃ¢Â€Â™s understanding of content moderation and the ways it can improve.",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.5}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/audit-antisemitic-incidents-2022,"Executive Summary

Each year, ADL (Anti-Defamation League) tracks incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault in the United States. Since 1979 we have published this information in an annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents.

In 2022, ADL tabulated 3,697 antisemitic incidents throughout the United States. This is a 36% increase from the 2,717 incidents tabulated in 2021 and the highest number on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979. This is the third time in the past five years that the year-end total has been the highest number ever recorded.

Incidents increased in each of the major Audit categories: antisemitic harassment increased 29% to 2,298; antisemitic vandalism increased 51% to 1,288 and antisemitic assaults increased 26% to 111. The vast majority of antisemitic assaults (107 out of 111) were perpetrated without the use of a deadly weapon. There was one fatality. Notably, visibly Orthodox Jews were targeted in 53% of the assault incidents nationally. This year, no assaults perpetrated against the Jewish community resulted in mass causalities.

The dramatic increase in antisemitic incidents in 2022 in almost all categories cannot be attributed to any one cause or ideology. Significant surges in incidents include high volume increases in organized white supremacist propaganda activity (102% increase to 852 incidents), K-12 schools (49% increase to 494 incidents) and college campuses (41% increase to 219 incidents), as well as deeply troubling percentage increases in attacks on Orthodox Jews (69% increase to 59 Incidents) and bomb threats toward Jewish institutions (an increase from eight to 91 incidents).


In 2022, 241 incidents involved references to Israel or Zionism. This is a decline from 345 such incidents in 2021, which was an unusually high year due to antisemitic reactions to the May 2021 military conflict between Israel and Hamas. Ã‚Â This number is still 35% higher than the number of Israel/Zionism-related incidents in 2020. Of 2022Ã¢Â€Â™s 241 anti-Zionist/anti-Israel-related incidents, 70 incidents could be identified as having been perpetrated by individuals associated with hostile anti-Zionist activist groups, most commonly Witness for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine and its affiliates. Forty-six incidents took the form of white supremacist groupsÃ¢Â€Â™ efforts to foment anti-Israel and antisemitic beliefs. For more on how ADL determines which Israel-related incidents to include, please see our Methodology section.

In 2022, there were 589 incidents logged at Jewish institutions such as synagogues, Jewish community centers and Jewish schools, an increase of 12% from 2021. The vast majority of those incidents took the form of harassment, but there were 86 incidents of vandalism and nine assaults. Bomb threats towards Jewish institutions were unusually high, with a total of 91. This is the highest number of bomb threats since 2017. Ã‚Â 

In 2022, 494 incidents took place at non-Jewish K-12 schools, an increase of 49% from 2021. Incidents on college campuses also increased, by 41%, with 219 incidents.

This escalation in antisemitic incidents comes just as ADL has reported on AmericansÃ¢Â€Â™ highest level of antisemitic attitudes in decades. According to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2023 report Antisemitic Attitudes in America, 20% of Americans believe six or more antisemitic tropes, which is significantly more than the 11% that ADL found in 2019. Although a causal link between antisemitic attitudes and antisemitic activity has not been proven, it would not be surprising if some antisemites have become emboldened to act on their hatred in the current environment. This dramatic increase also occurs just as the FBI released its 2021 hate crime data (a year behind this report) showing that Jews remain the single most targeted religious minority in America.Ã‚Â 

The complete dataset for antisemitic incidents for 2016-2022 is available on ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s H.E.A.T. Map, an interactive online tool that allows users to geographically chart antisemitic incidents and extremist activity nationally and regionally. Some details have been removed from the incident listings to protect victimsÃ¢Â€Â™ privacy.

ADL acknowledges our Jewish partner organizations who shared data for the Audit. Those organizations include Community Security Initiative (CSI), Community Security Service (CSS), Hillel International, Secure Community Network (SCN), Union of Reform Judaism and the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitic-attitudes-america-conspiracy-theories-holocaust-education-and-other,"Introduction

In late 2022, NORC and ADL surveyed a nationally representative sample of over 4,000 Americans to better understand attitudes toward Jews and Israel. The survey included several batteries of questions, including: sections probing general attitudes toward Jews and Israel; questions designed to understand respondentsÃ¢Â€Â™ level of agreement with both historic and contemporary anti-Jewish and anti-Israel tropes; questions measuring literacy and familiarity with Jews and Israel; several comparative prejudice experiments; and general conspiracy theory belief questions.

As detailed in an earlier topline report, the research revealed widespread levels of anti-Jewish sentiment among American adults. ADL found that a significant proportion of Americans saw Jews as:

Clannish outsiders: 70 percent and 53 percent of Americans said that Jews stick together more than others and go out of their way to hire other Jews, respectively
Dually loyal: 39 percent of Americans thought Jews are more loyal to Israel than to the United States
Disproportionately powerful: 38 percent of Americans thought Jews always like to be at the head of things, 26 percent thought Jews have too much power in business, and 20 percent thought Jews have too much power in the United States today

On average, Americans agreed with 4.2 of the 14 statements included in the anti-Jewish question battery. But a fifth of Americans (20 percent) agreed with 6 or more of the 11 original statements - the highest level of antisemitic attitudes detected in decades of asking this same series of questions.

The research also demonstrated that negative sentiments toward Israel, including anti-Israel sentiments rooted in antisemitic conspiracy theories, were held by broad swaths of the American population:

Almost half (40 percent) of Americans agreed that Israel treats the Palestinians like the Nazis treated the Jews
About a quarter (24 percent) of Americans thought that Israel does not make a positive contribution to the world, and that Israel and its supporters are a bad influence on our democracy
Just under a fifth (18 percent) of Americans said they were not comfortable spending time with people who support Israel

Given these findings, researchers further probed where such attitudes and sentiments were coming from, what phenomena did they overlap with, and how did they manifest. If people agreed with more antisemitic tropes or had negative views on Israel, what else did they think, feel, or know about Jews or Israel?

As will be outlined below, researchers found several overarching answers to that question. Generally speaking, respondents who agreed with more anti-Jewish tropes:

Knew significantly less about Jews, Judaism, and Jewish history, including under-counting the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust and overestimating the proportional size of the American Jewish community
Were somewhat more likely to not have any relationships with Jewish people and/or classify their past experiences with Jews more negatively
Were significantly less likely to think that Jews face organized hostility or danger for being Jewish, or that Jew-hatred is a serious or growing problem
Broadly, as one of the studyÃ¢Â€Â™s experiments demonstrated, the term Ã¢Â€ÂœJewÃ¢Â€Â has a Whitening effect on how people perceive individuals of ambiguous race. For White Americans, seeing a Jew as Ã¢Â€ÂœWhiteÃ¢Â€Â (i.e., like them) was associated with believing fewer anti-Jewish tropes. For people of color, there was no significant relationship between perceiving Jews as White and anti-Jewish trope belief
Were significantly more likely to believe a range of conspiracy theories, including a conspiracy theory question designed to resemble the Great Replacement Theory

In contrast, researchers found that few of these factors had statistically significant relationships with sentiment toward Israel. Indeed, only one factor, the extent to which a respondent had a negative experience with Jews, was associated with sentiment toward Israel and, even then, it did so marginally. In fact, respondents appear willing to condemn or condone Israel and its supporters largely independent of their level of knowledge about Israel.

Taken together, these findings help draw a new, composite portrait of how people feel about Jews and Israel. This portrait illuminates both key predictors of negative attitudes towards Jews and Israel and critical avenues for future causal research.

This report is the second in a multi-part series based on ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2022 study with the National Opinion Research Center in partnership with the One8 Foundation. Future reports, to be published in the coming months, will use additional data from the survey to explore how and why anti-Jewish and anti-Israel attitudes spread, as well as in which demographic subgroups antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiments are most common.","[1, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/white-supremacist-propaganda-soars-all-time-high-2022,"In 2022, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) tracked a significant increase in white supremacist propaganda efforts, which included the distribution of racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBTQ+ fliers, stickers, banners, graffiti and posters, as well as laser projections. Our data shows a 38 percent increase in incidents from the previous year, with a total of 6,751 cases reported in 2022, compared to 4,876 in 2021. This is the highest number of white supremacist propaganda incidents ADL has ever recorded.Ã‚Â 

In addition to the overall increase in incidents, 2022 also saw antisemitic propaganda more than double, rising from 352 incidents in 2021 to 852 incidents in 2022. For the third straight year, the number of overall propaganda incidents on campuses dropped, from 232 to 219, the lowest since ADL began tracking campus incidents in 2017.

Propaganda campaigns allow white supremacists to maximize media and online attention for their groups and messaging while limiting the risk of individual exposure, negative media coverage, arrests and public backlash that often accompanies more public activities. Propaganda, which affects entire communities, allows a small number of people to have an outsized impact.

Propaganda was reported in 2022 in every U.S. state except Hawaii, with the highest levels of activity (from most to least active) in Texas, Massachusetts, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, California, Utah, Florida, Connecticut and Georgia. The ADL H.E.A.T. Map provides a visual representation of the propaganda efforts by geographic location.

The Perpetrators

Throughout 2022, at least 50 different white supremacist groups and networks distributed propaganda, but three of them Ã¢Â€Â“ Patriot Front, Goyim Defense League (GDL) and White Lives Matter (WLM) - were responsible for 93 percent of the activity.

As has been the case since 2019, Texas-based Patriot Front was responsible for the vast majority Ã¢Â€Â“ 80 percent Ã¢Â€Â“ of propaganda distributions in 2022. The group distributed propaganda in every state except Alaska and Hawaii but was most active (from most to least active) in Massachusetts, Texas, Michigan, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Utah.

Since rebranding in October 2018, Patriot Front has used a cynical iteration of Ã¢Â€ÂœpatriotismÃ¢Â€Â to promote its white supremacist and neo-fascist ideology. In 2022, the group added yard signs to its repertoire, and stayed on Ã¢Â€Âœbrand,Ã¢Â€Â using red, white and blue colors in its propaganda. The group continues to avoid using traditional white supremacist language and symbols in its messaging, instead using ambiguous phrasing like Ã¢Â€ÂœFor the Nation Against the State,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœRevolution is Tradition,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœReclaim America,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerica FirstÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœOne Nation Against Immigration.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

The Goyim Defense League (GDL), an antisemitic network that has significant crossover with other white supremacist groups and movements, was responsible for at least 492 propaganda incidents in 2022, representing roughly seven percent of the total propaganda nationwide and 58 percent of the yearÃ¢Â€Â™s antisemitic propaganda incidents. This is a significant increase from the 74 GDL propaganda incidents recorded in 2021.

GDLÃ¢Â€Â™s overarching goal is to expel Jews from America. To that end, their propaganda casts aspersions on Jews and spreads antisemitic myths and conspiracy theories in hopes of turning Americans against the Jewish people.Ã‚Â GDLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2022 propaganda blames Jews for a variety of perceived social grievances, including immigration, pornography and abortion.

GDL propaganda was recorded in 43 different states, with the vast majority of incidents (from most to least active) in California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Illinois and New York.

Ã‚Â 

White Lives Matter (WLM), a network of white supremacists who engage in Ã¢Â€Âœpro-white activismÃ¢Â€Â on a designated day each month, was responsible for the third highest number (six percent) of propaganda incidents in 2022 and roughly 14 percent of the antisemitic propaganda incidents.

The Center on Extremism recorded 430 incidents of WLM propaganda in 2022, more than three times the 140 incidents recorded in 2021. These incidents occurred in 36 different states with the highest number of incidents (from most to least active) in Washington, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, North Carolina and Texas.

WLM propaganda ranges from Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite Lives MatterÃ¢Â€Â stickers with a QR code to the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s Telegram page, to messages about the ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory.Ã‚Â Some WLM propaganda promotes or shares links to the antisemitic film ""Europa: The Last Battle.""

On at least 19 occasions, WLM propaganda was accompanied by materials from other white supremacist groups and movements, including propaganda from GDL, Folkish Resistance Movement, New Jersey European Heritage Association, Ã‚Â League of the South and various Active Clubs.

Ã‚Â 

Folkish Resistance Movement (FRM) was responsible for 170 propaganda distributions in 2022, down from 205 in 2021. The groupÃ¢Â€Â™s 2022 propaganda, which made up roughly three percent of propaganda nationwide and 17 percent of antisemitic propaganda incidents, was recorded in 21 different states. The majority (67 incidents) of FRMÃ¢Â€Â™s propaganda was reported in Texas, with the remaining 20 states averaging five incidents each.

Formed as Folksfront in early 2019 and rebranded as FRM in late 2021, FRM distributes propaganda that features crossed runes that resemble a swastika and explicit white supremacist slogans such as Ã¢Â€ÂœOur blood is our faith, our race is our nationÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœBlood and soil.Ã¢Â€Â Approximately 84 percent of FRMÃ¢Â€Â™s propaganda is antisemitic, and sometimes includes a broken Star of David accompanied by phrases such as Ã¢Â€ÂœBreak Debt SlaveryÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€ÂœResist Zionism.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Active Clubs, a nationwide network of localized white supremacist crews that often overlap with the White Lives Matter network and other white supremacist groups, were responsible for 92 propaganda distributions in 2022. Propaganda from this network was recorded in 16 different states, but the vast majority of incidents were in Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

Active Clubs are largely inspired by Robert RundoÃ¢Â€Â™s white supremacist Rise Above Movement (R.A.M.) and many of the clubs use stickers from Will2Rise, R.A.M.Ã¢Â€Â™s merchandising arm. Some of the more established Active Clubs created their own recruitment propaganda.Ã‚Â

Antisemitic Propaganda Distribution

2022Ã¢Â€Â™s massive uptick in antisemitic propaganda was largely due to GDLÃ¢Â€Â™s growth and their initiation of propaganda campaigns. The formation of several new antisemitic white supremacist groups in 2022 also contributed to the rise in antisemitic incidents. These new groups Ã¢Â€Â“ the Texas-based Aryan Freedom Network, NatSoc Florida, the Iowa-based Crew 319, the Southern California-based Clockwork Crew (aka Crew 562), Florida Nationalists and the short-lived, New York-based Aryan National Army Ã¢Â€Â“ were responsible for seven percent (or 62 incidents) of the antisemitic propaganda distributions in 2022.

As in previous years, extremists used fliers, posters, stickers, banners and graffiti to share their antisemitic views. In Florida, NatSoc Florida and/or GDL used laser projectors to cast antisemitic messages on buildings on at least seven occasions. Individuals associated with GDL, Crew 562 and Crew 319 drove around in moving vans draped with antisemitic propaganda. Two such incidents occurred in California and one in Iowa.

Ã‚Â 

Campus Propaganda Distribution

In 2022, there were 219 incidents of white supremacist propaganda distribution on campuses, a six percent decrease from 2021 and the lowest number since ADL began tracking in 2017. While the majority ofÃ‚Â these incidents occurred on college or university campuses, at least 11 incidents were reported on K-12 campuses.

Patriot Front was responsible for 162 (or 74 percent) of the 219 on-campus incidents. Other groups distributed propaganda on campuses in much smaller numbers, including GDL, WLM, FMR and Active Clubs.

On-campus propaganda was recorded in 39 different states, with the highest levels of activity (from most to least active) in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan.

White Supremacist Banners

In 2022, white supremacist groups increasingly used banners, often draped over highway overpasses, to publicize their hate. ADL recorded at least 252 banner drops, a 38 percent increase from the 183 counted in 2021.

As was the case in 2021, Patriot Front was responsible for the majority (75 percent) of the yearÃ¢Â€Â™s banner drops, with 192 incidents, repeating previous yearsÃ¢Â€Â™ messaging: Ã¢Â€ÂœNo More Foreign Wars,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœRevolution is TraditionÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœLiberty or Death.Ã¢Â€Â WLM, FRM, GDL, NatSoc Florida and National Socialist Club also used banners in 2022.

White Supremacist Events

In 2022, ADL documented 167 white supremacist events, a 55 percent increase from the 108 recorded in 2021. Events took place in 33 states, with the most activity (from most to least active) in Massachusetts, California, Ohio and Florida.

The White Lives Matter network was responsible for 43 percent of these events. WLM have been organizing small, monthly demonstrations since April 2021, which attract between five and 15 people and usually take place along the roadside, on an overpass, at a park or outside a government building.

Sampling of WLM events in 2022

Ã‚Â 

The neo-Nazi National Socialist Club (NSC) held 32 events, ranging from private gatherings to flash demonstrations. NSCÃ¢Â€Â™s 2022 events included protesting the Somali population in Maine, a literary event in Rhode Island and several drag queen story hour events in Massachusetts.

Patriot Front was responsible for 26 events, notably four of the largest flash demonstrations, including marches in Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston and Indianapolis. Patriot Front also protested LGBTQ+ events in Texas and Ohio. In June, 31 members of Patriot Front were arrested near Coeur DÃ¢Â€Â™Alene, Idaho, after police stopped a U-Haul truck near a Ã¢Â€ÂœPride in the ParkÃ¢Â€Â event. The Patriot Front members found inside the truck were dressed uniformly and equipped with riot shields, and were charged with criminal conspiracy to riot.

Earlier in the year, several white supremacists associated with the National Socialist Movement were arrested for their alleged role in the hate crime assault of a Jewish man during a January neo-Nazi roadside rally in Orlando, Florida.

White supremacists also held private gatherings such as fight nights, white power music concerts and conferences, including the America First Political Action Conference in Orlando, the annual American Renaissance Conference in Tennessee and the National Justice PartyÃ¢Â€Â™s National Party Meeting in Ohio, which was the best attended extremist event of the year.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/murder-and-extremism-united-states-2022,"Executive Summary
Every year, individuals with ties to different extreme causes and movements kill people in the United States; the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) tracks these murders. Extremists regularly commit murders in the service of their ideology, in the service of a group or gang they may belong to, or even while engaging in traditional, non-ideological criminal activities.
In 2022, domestic extremists killed at least 25 people in the U.S., in 12 separate incidents. This represents a decrease from the 33 extremist-related murders documented in 2021 and is comparable to the 22 extremist-related murders in 2020. Ã‚Â It continues the recent trend of fewer extremist-related killings after a five-year span of 47-78 extremist-related murders per year (2015-2019).
The 2022 murder totals would have been much lower if not for two high-casualty extremist-related shooting sprees.Ã‚Â  Only 10 of the 25 deaths occurred outside of those spreesÃ¢Â€Â”and one of those 10 deaths occurred in a less lethal mass shooting attempt.Ã‚Â 
The issue of extremist-related mass killings is of growing concern and is the subject of a special section of this report. From the 1970s through the 2000s, domestic extremist-related mass killings were relatively uncommon.Ã‚Â  However, over the past 12 years, their number has greatly increased. Most of these mass killings were committed by right-wing extremists, but left-wing and domestic Islamist extremists were also responsible for incidents. The Center on Extremism has identified 62 extremist-connected mass killing incidents since 1970, with 46 of them being ideologically motivated.Ã‚Â  Disturbingly, more than half (26, or 57%) of the ideological mass killings have occurred within the past 12 years. Of particular concern in recent years are shootings inspired by white supremacist Ã¢Â€ÂœaccelerationistÃ¢Â€Â propaganda urging such attacks.
In 2022, 18 of the 25 extremist-related murders appear to have been committed in whole or part for ideological motives, while the remaining seven murders either have no clear motive or were committed for a non-ideological motive.
All the extremist-related murders in 2022 were committed by right-wing extremists of various kinds, who typically commit most such killings each year but only occasionally are responsible for all (the last time this occurred was 2012).Ã‚Â  Left-wing extremists engage in violence ranging from assaults to fire-bombings and arsons, but since the late 1980s have not often targeted people with deadly violence. The same cannot be said for domestic Islamist extremists, but deadly incidents linked to Islamist extremism have decreased significantly in the U.S. over the past five years.Ã‚Â 
White supremacists commit the greatest number of domestic extremist-related murders in most years, but in 2022 the percentage was unusually high:Ã‚Â  21 of the 25 murders were linked to white supremacists.Ã‚Â  Again, this is primarily due to mass shootings. Only one of the murders was committed by a right-wing anti-government extremistÃ¢Â€Â”the lowest number since 2017.",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.5}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/adl-crowdfunding-report-how-bigots-and-extremists-collect-and-use-millions-online,"Key Findings
Extremists are using online crowdfunding platforms like GiveSendGo and GoFundMe to raise millions of dollars for their ideologically driven activities. Through crowdfunding, extremists have generated at least $6,246,072 from 324 campaigns between 2016 and mid-2022.
Extremist campaigns found on these platforms espouse hateful rhetoric including antisemitism, white supremacy, QAnon conspiracies and anti-LGBTQ+ extremism, as well as rhetoric from antisemitic sects of Black Hebrew Israelites.
Crowdfunding campaigns have been used by extremists to fund direct actions and attacks on their perceived enemies or marginalized communities; legal defenses for extremists who face consequences for these actions; propaganda efforts and other expenses.
GiveSendGo has facilitated the vast majority of these funds, hosting 230 campaigns operated by or for extremists and their causes. These campaigns collected more than 86.5% of the funds tracked by the Center on Extremism.Ã‚Â Some extremists have also created their own crowdfunding platforms, but they have been comparatively unsuccessful and short-lived.
Crowdfunding played a significant role in the January 6 insurrection and Unite the Right rally, as well as other, smaller extremist events. The money made through crowdfunding allowed for travel and supplies, and for legal and medical expenses.Ã‚Â 
Crowdfunding platforms and financial institutions should expand existing anti-hate policies, as well as implement and enforce explicit anti-extremism policies. Broad anti-hate policies are not enough to address the spread of extremism online, and crowdfunding services should determine how to define, act against and identify extremist content on their platforms. Payment processors should reevaluate supporting platforms that allow extremism.","[1, 2, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

His Excellency JÃƒÂ¼rg Lauber
President, Human Rights Council
United Nations
Palais des Nations
1211 Geneva
Switzerland

Dear President Lauber,

I am writing on behalf of ADL (Anti-Defamation League) to formally request that the Human Rights Council not renew the term of Ms. Francesca Albanese, the Special Rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, upon its expiration on April 1, 2025. Ms. Albanese's conduct has consistently violated the Code of Conduct for Special Procedure Mandate-Holders as outlined in HRC resolution 5/2, warranting the rejection of her reappointment under UNHRC Presidential Statement 8/PRST/2.

ADL has documented numerous instances where Ms. Albanese has made inflammatory and antisemitic statements, undermining the principles of impartiality and integrity required of her role as set out by UNHRC resolution 5/2.Ã‚Â  She has fostered for antisemitic narratives and Holocaust distortion and has amplified unverified claims from terrorist organizations like Hamas.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Her rhetoric, including recent comments accusing Jewish organizations of using ""mafia tactics"" for advocating on behalf of Jewish communities, further demonstrates her unfitness for any UN post. Such statements not only perpetuate harmful antisemitic tropes but also compromise the credibility of the UNHRC in fighting prejudice and hate, and the Secretary GeneralÃ¢Â€Â™s expressed commitment to combating global antisemitism.

Ms. Albanese's actions have been widely condemned, and her unfitness to hold UN office has been pointed out by multiple government officials from Canada, France, Germany, and the United States.Ã‚Â  The UNHRC must uphold the integrity and independence of its special procedures system. The mounting evidence of Ms. Albanese's violations obligates the Council to act decisively and ensure her mandate is not extended. Failure to address this issue would signal an unacceptable tolerance for antisemitism within the UNHRC.

We urge you to uphold the Council's commitment to impartiality, accountability, and human rights for all by denying Ms. Albanese's reappointment. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter, and we look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Greenblatt

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/hate-no-game-hate-and-harassment-online-games-2022,"Executive Summary

In 2021, ADL found that nearly one in ten gamers between ages 13 and 17 had been exposed to white-supremacist ideology and themes in online multiplayer games. An estimated 2.3 million teens were exposed to white-supremacist ideology in multiplayer games like Roblox, World of Warcraft, Fortnite, Apex Legends, League of Legends, Madden NFL, Overwatch, and Call of Duty.

Hate and extremism in online games have worsened since last year.

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual report on experiences in online multiplayer games shows that the spread of hate, harassment, and extremism in these digital spaces continues to grow unchecked. Our survey explores the social interactions, experiences, attitudes, and behaviors of online multiplayer gamers ages 10 and above nationwide.

For the fourth consecutive year, the already-high rates of harassment experienced by a nationally representative sample of nearly 100 million American adult gamers increased. According to the Entertainment Software Association, 76% of gamers in the United States are over 18.

Harassment experienced by teens ages 13-17 increased from last year. For the first time, ADL has collected data on harassment experienced by pre-teens ages 10-12.

The games industryÃ¢Â€Â™s progress is slow even when compared to that of social media companies, which are hardly exemplars of user safety or accountability. Only one major games company, Roblox Corporation, has an explicit, public-facing policy against extremism. Earlier this year, Wildlife Studios, a mobile-games company headquartered in Brazil, produced the first gaming transparency report that shares data on how a company acted against hate and harassment in its online games, followed by Xbox in November 2022. Transparency reports and policies banning the expression of extremist ideologies are the bare minimum required to fight hate in online games.

The immense popularity of online games means it is likely that you or someone close to you has experienced hate and harassment. More than two out of three AmericansÃ¢Â€Â”over 215 million people of all agesÃ¢Â€Â”play video games, including both online and offline games. The video games industry is a $203 billion market, with the North American video game market generating over $54 billion in 2022.

In focusing on online multiplayer games, this report offers concrete guidance for the government, civil society, and industry to take meaningful steps in making those games safer for all users, regardless of their age or identity.",[1],"{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.0}",HIGH

This report is ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual assessment of anti-Israel activism on American college campuses. Our goal is not to document or quantify routine criticism of IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s actions or policies, but to provide a snapshot of a more radical activist movement which places opposition to Israel and/or Zionism as core elements of campus life or as a prerequisite for full acceptance in the campus community.

Our snapshot is composed of hundreds of individual incidents that have been documented by ADL. These incidents can include verbal or written harassment of Zionists or Israelis, efforts to coopt campus institutions to support BDS movements, anti-Israel protests that affect the campus, events that feature radical anti-Israel messaging and programming and the dissemination of rhetoric or policies that marginalize, demonize or exclude Jews, Zionists or Israelis from campus life.

Many of the incidents described in this report are antisemitic in intent or in effect. While other incidents may not be antisemitic, collectively they may contribute to a more hostile campus environment for Jewish students.[1]

Not everyone involved in the incidents described in this report may identify as part of an anti-Israel activist movement. But when they espouse rhetoric or tactics identical to those employed by anti-Israel activists, their actions become indistinguishable from them.

ADL researchers gathered the incidents featured in this report primarily using open-source research methods. Much of our data on campus anti-Israel incidents was compiled by diligently following the social media accounts of anti-Israel activists themselves. Other information came from student newspapers and other news media; we also gleaned important insight from the work of other organizations, including the Israel on Campus Coalition (ICC), Hillel and AMCHA. In cases where we obtained information from the media or from third parties, we always sought out primary sources to substantiate the reporting. We did not include incidents which we felt lacked evidence or credibility.

Other information on campus anti-Israel activism was reported directly to ADL by victims and constituents. Some of it was relayed through our partners including Hillel International, the Secure Community Network, Chabad, Community Security Initiative, the Israel on Campus Coalition (ICC) and others. ADL professionals assessed each one of these reports for evidence and credibility.

This report is a snapshot; it is not comprehensive or scientific. It is also certainly an undercount. Many anti-Israel activists do not post their activities on social media; some victims of anti-Zionism-related harassment may not have come forward; some incidents may not have been covered by campus press. To get a complete picture of the state of anti-Israel activism on campuses, it is important to supplement this incident-based, open source-oriented report with other research, including public opinion polling and surveys of the lived experiences of American Jewish college students.","[1, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

This report examines the extremist and antisemitic trends and incidents in the state of Florida from 2020 to the present.

The past two years have seen a significant increase in extremist related incidents both nationwide and in the state of Florida. These incidents have been driven, in part, by widespread disinformation and conspiracy theories which have animated extremists and fueled antisemitism. The result: unrest and violence, from the January 6 insurrection to white supremacist activity to a spike in hate crimes.

In Florida, new white supremacist groups have formed, including White Lives Matter, Sunshine State Nationalists, NatSoc Florida and Florida Nationalists, while existing neo-Nazi and accelerationist groups have broadened their audience both online and on the ground activities. Other extremist groups such as Oath Keepers and the ProudÃ‚Â BoysÃ‚Â have shifted their strategies to focus on the local level, disrupting school board meetings and even running for political office.

Top Level Findings: Florida

Florida is home to an extensive, interconnected network of white supremacists and other far-right extremists. This network, which often collaborates in planning and executing propaganda distribution campaigns, banner drops and in-person demonstrations, includes the White Lives Matter (WLM) network, the antisemitic Goyim Defense League (GDL), the New Jersey European Heritage Association (NJEHA), NSDAP (named after the Nazi Party of Germany), the neo-Nazi Sunshine State Nationalists (SSN), Ã‚Â NatSoc Florida (NSF) and the National Socialist Movement (NSM). Many of the individuals in this network, which includes dozens, attend events organized by multiple groups giving each group an outsized appearance.
From January 2020 to August 2022, ADLÃ‚Â Center on Extremism (COE) Ã‚Â recorded over 400 instances of white supremacist propaganda distribution in Florida. Ã‚Â The overwhelming majority of these incidents involved the white supremacist groups Patriot Front and the New Jersey European Heritage Association. Ninety-five of these incidents included antisemitic language or symbols, targeted Jewish institutions, or both. Propaganda allows extremists to disseminate hateful messages and gain attention with little risk of public exposure.
Florida is home to the most people charged in relation to the January 6 insurrection. Of the 855 individuals charged in connection to the insurrection, 90 (10.5%) hail from the state of Florida.
Hate crimes continued to rise in the state of Florida over the last several years. According to the FBIÃ¢Â€Â™s 2020 Ã‚Â Hate Crime Statistics reportÃ‚Â  (the most recent data available), 56.1% of nationally reported religion-based hate crimes in 2020 targeted the Jewish community.Ã‚Â In Florida, hate crimes against Jews accounted for 80% of the religiously motivated incidents in 2020, and antisemitic hate crimes have risen 300% since 2012.
Florida has seen a dramatic rise in antisemitic incidents, according to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. In 2021, the number of reported incidents increased 50% over 2020 numbers, rising from 127 to 190. This included 142 instances of harassment, 47 instances of vandalism and one antisemitic assault.
In August of 2022, COE found a significant increase in violent rhetoric in right-wing online spaces following the FBI search of former President Donald TrumpÃ¢Â€Â™s Mar-a-Lago property. Threats have largely targeted federal law enforcement and Department of Justice officials, including specific law enforcement officers who were onsite for the search and magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who signed off on the search warrant.

The National Extremist Landscape

Domestic extremist activity is on the rise in the U.S. and poses a considerable risk to our country. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released four terrorism advisory bulletins, rather than its usual two, underscoring a uniquely heightened threat environment. In March 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report specifically highlighting the increased threat posed by Domestic Violence Extremists (DVEs). This assessment stated that Ã¢Â€Âœracially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVEs) and militia violent extremists (MVEs) present the most lethal DVE threatsÃ¢Â€Â and are most likely to conduct mass causality attacks.

In January 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) issued a Joint Intelligence Bulletin specifically detailing the Ã¢Â€Âœenduring nature of violent threats posed to Jewish communities.Ã¢Â€Â This bulletin, issued in the wake of a hostage situation that took place at a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, highlighted the threat that violent extremists pose to Jewish intuitions and targets and the likelihood for copycat attacks to occur.

Against this backdrop, the Center on Extremism (COE) actively monitors and tracks many extremist groups and individuals across the state of Florida. Ã‚Â The breadth of extremist activities includes spreading propaganda, holding rallies and even participating in violence.

These groups maintain a robust social media presence across both mainstream and fringe platforms. From behind their computer screens, individuals and groups recruit, radicalize and organize on both the national and local levels. They use message boards, chats and channels to share propaganda materials, engage in antisemitic conspiracy theorizing, promote violence and plan in-person events. Media coverage of their incidents is used to boast their perceived successes, raise money and further bolster their followings.

Executive Summary

The online game Minecraft, owned by Microsoft, has amassed 141 million active users since it was launched in 2011. It is used in school communities, among friend groups and even has been employed by the U.N. Despite its ubiquity as an online space, little has been reported on how hate and harassment manifest in Minecraft, as well as how it performs content moderation. To fill this research gap, Take This, ADL and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in collaboration with GamerSafer, analyzed hate and harassment in Minecraft based on anonymized data from January 1st to March 30th, 2022 consensually provided from three private Minecraft servers (no other data was gathered from the servers except the anonymized chat and report logs used in this study). While this analysis is not representative of how all Minecraft spaces function, it is a crucial step in understanding how important online gaming spaces operate, the form that hate takes in these spaces, and whether content moderation can mitigate hate.Ã‚Â 

After examining chats and user reports from data provided by GamerSafer, we found:

Many in-game offenders are repeat offenders. Almost a fifth of offending users had multiple actions taken against them during the data collection.
Temporary bans proved to be an effective solution for reprimanding bad behavior. Early evidence shows temporary bans to be more effective than muting in reducing the rate of offending behaviors by the moderated player.
Servers with in-depth community guidelines were associated with more positive social spaces. Of the three servers reviewed, Server 3 had the most extensive community guidelines, the highest ratio of moderators to players, and the lowest frequency of sexually explicit, hateful, and severely toxic behavior between users, suggesting the positive impact of robust guidelines.
Server rules appear to matter more than moderation enforcement in shaping communication norms. There was no effect of moderation events on rates of server-wide toxic behaviors over time. Nonetheless, rates of toxic behaviors still correlated with server staffing and rules.Ã‚Â 
The rates of harmful behavior differed depending on the message type.Ã‚Â 
Hateful messages were 21% more likely for public chats than private ones.
Sexually explicit messages were 9% more likely for private chats than public ones.
The analysis further suggests hateful rhetoric has been normalized in gaming spaces. The presence of slurs previously only affiliated with white nationalism and hate groups suggests the normalization of extreme language in gaming spaces.Ã‚Â 
Sexually explicit language occurred 3x as often as hateful language

Based on the above findings, we suggest:

Increasing researcher access to data. Granting researchers and watchdogs access to data helps to identify and address the challenges of hateful, harassing, and toxic behavior in spaces meant to have a positive social impact.
Investing in content moderation efforts and robust community guidelines. Active, effective human moderation and community guidelines are critical to reducing sexually explicit, hateful, and severely toxic behavior in gaming spaces as the server with the most staff and most extensive guidelines had the fewest incidents of these kinds of behaviors.
Additional research into content moderation and complementary tools and techniques, including the:
relative influences of robust server rules and high rates of staffing on levels of hate and harassment
individual and aggregate benefits of content moderation efforts. Moderator intervention seems to reduce individual harmful behavior, but it remains unclear as to whether it impacts server-wide behavior over time. Future work should focus on determining the long-term effects and aggregate of moderator intervention.
impact of tools and techniques that enable player accountability and go beyond moderation, such as player verification and globally blocklisting players banned for severe harms. These measures can add responsibility and minimize reoffending.

This work highlights the importance of granting third parties access to in-game data. Allowing researchers access to unfiltered data, while still protecting user data privacy, can provide unprecedented insight into the interactions between users within gaming spaces, and more broadly, usersÃ¢Â€Â™ interactions in online social spaces. Without this level of data transparency, the industry will neither be able to identify nor address the challenge of hateful, harassing, and toxic behavior in online gaming spaces.

IntroductionÃ‚Â 

Three billion people worldwide play online multiplayer games; 97 million of them are American. Digital games have permeated almost every aspect of pop culture but the explosive growth of these spaces and communities has led to the rise of toxic gamer cultures that exclude people and worse, threaten their safety. Hate and harassment are now widespread in gaming spaces, worrying parents, scholars, and policymakers.

The high prevalence of hate in online games has fueled concern that problematic language and behavior are becoming normalized within gaming communities, desensitizing individuals to hate speech and fostering polarization between communities.

Nearly all gamers have experienced harassment. ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2021 annual survey of hate and harassment in games found that 5 out of 6 adults ages 18-45 and 3 out of 5 young people ages 13-17 experienced harassment. One of the more pernicious forms of online harassment is hate, which is broadly defined as speech or behavior that targets people based on their identity, including gender, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical appearance, or disability. ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s survey also found that 8% of adults and 10% of young people reported being exposed to some form of hate speech, including identity-based harassment, exposure to white supremacist ideology, and Holocaust denial. These numbers may be much higher, as recent research found that 64% of online players have experienced hate speech directly, and 83% have witnessed it happening to others.Ã‚Â 

To gain a better understanding of hate speech within gaming cultures, ADL partnered with Take This, the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, and GamerSafer to examine speech patterns in public and private chat logs from private Minecraft Java servers. The decentralized, player-run nature of Minecraft Java edition provides a novel opportunity to assess hate and harassment in gaming spaces.Ã‚Â 

Minecraft Java Edition

Minecraft is a popular sandbox-style game developed by Mojang Studios in 2011 and was subsequently acquired by Microsoft in 2014. Players can create and break apart various kinds of blocks in three-dimensional worlds. Minecraft is often framed as a Ã¢Â€ÂœsandboxÃ¢Â€Â because, like a traditional playground sandbox, only a playerÃ¢Â€Â™s imagination limits what they can do. There are no real goals or objectives except the ones that players set for themselves.Ã‚Â 

There are two versions of Minecraft: the Bedrock and Java editions. The Java edition primarily allows players to independently host and privately run game servers with no oversight from Microsoft whereas Bedrock is primarily hosted by Mojang, which partners closely with the serversÃ¢Â€Â™ users on content moderation. In June 2022, Minecraft announced it was enabling players of the Java edition to report violative content to the central Minecraft team at Mojang Studios. Simultaneously, Mojang confirmed that this effort would only focus on what players report and exclude any proactive monitoring or moderation.Ã‚Â 

The size and scope of these servers can vary greatly. For example, an individual can host a small server open to a handful of people living in a particular neighborhood to be used as a creative after-school space. A server could be used by an entire classroom or a school to explore group learning in a digital space. It may also be a server hosted by an organization such as the United Nations to provide young people with an interactive experience in urban planning. Since server maps are based on user-generated content, players can also spread hateful concepts and congregate with like-minded people. Private Minecraft servers have been found to host the creation and re-enactment of Holocaust concentration camps. Until recently, the administrators of Java servers (such as educators setting up a Minecraft server for their students) enacted all content moderation decisions for that server. With the recent advent of player reporting, the Minecraft team at Microsoft will also play a role in content moderation, though what that role is remains to be seen.

We hope this report provides a benchmark on the scope and form that hate takes in the online games millions play every day.

How We Conducted Our Analysis

We analyzed public and private chat data provided by GamerSafer from three Minecraft Java servers to measure the levels of hateful speech in gaming spaces. The three servers varied in size and moderation capacity.Ã‚Â 

Server 1 housed a large (roughly 20,000 players), primarily adolescent audience (14-18 years old), dozens of server staff, and upheld very strict rule enforcement. The player-to-moderator ratio was around 465:1. Competitive player versus player (PvP) play was optional on this server. Server 1 was the most active of the three servers and constituted 94% of the analyzed data.Ã‚Â 

Server 2 had a smaller (almost 1,000 players), slightly older audience (averaging 15-20 years old) and only two staff members that implemented minimal to no rule enforcement. The player-to-moderator ratio was around 500:1. On this server, competitive PvP was encouraged.Ã‚Â 

Server 3 was the smallest of the three servers, housing around 400 players. The player-to-moderator ratio was by far the smallest around 41:1. This server was primarily an audience of older adolescents and adults (aged 16+) with a moderation team of 10 staff members. Gameplay was largely collaborative, with PvP limited to small, designated areas. Of all the servers, Server 3 had the most extensive guidelines and active moderation team but staff had trouble enforcing the rules.Ã‚Â 

GamerSafer offers a suite of safety tech solutions to gaming companies, including a special plugin for Minecraft, supporting server staff and moderators to manage infractions and in-game reports. Hate speech is one of 37 ban categoriesÃ‚Â in the Minecraft plugin. Tracking incidents of reported behavior among game players across servers, the report logs contain 458 total disciplinary actions against 374 unique users.Ã‚Â 

Analysis was two-fold. First, we examined the formal reports made to moderators and moderator actions in regards to any form of hateful or harassing behavior. This was done to better understand the nature of the servers and broad patterns of behavior. Secondly, we conducted a textual analysis on the in-game chat to examine speech patterns as well as identify hateful or harassing actions that may not have been logged by the moderators.Ã‚Â 

Findings
Formal reports of hate speech via GamerSaferÃ‚Â 

Many in-game offenders are repeat offenders. Almost a fifth of users (64) had multiple actions taken against them during data collection. Of the actioned users, 90 were sentenced to a permanent ban. 21 (23%) of permanently banned users received prior actions (temporary bans, mutes, and warnings).Ã‚Â  Server 1 contained 93.9% of these reports.Ã‚Â 

Moderators have the ability to ban players. Two-thirds of the actions taken by moderators were bans. As seen in Figure 1, a temporary ban from the server was the primary action (46%), followed by a permanent ban (20%), and a verbal warning (19%). We do not know with certainty how closely bans were enacted following a violation.

[Figure 1. Frequency of moderation intervention across the three servers.]

Figure 2 shows the most common reported violations reported were hacking, or trying to create an advantage beyond normal gameplay (40% of all reports); harassment, including hostility, spamming, bullying, trolling, and threats (16% of all reports); hate, or attacks rooted in prejudice towards someoneÃ¢Â€Â™s race or ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and other forms of identity (10% of all reports); sexual misconduct in the form of inappropriate comments (9% of all reports); and exploiting mechanics, or using a bug or glitch in a game for an advantage (9% of all reports).

[Figure 2. Most frequent violations recorded through formal reports.]

The role of moderation

Moderation efforts reduce unwanted behavior. They led to substantial reductions in sexually explicit, hateful, and severely toxic behavior across all servers. We found:

Temporary bans were found to be the most effective for reducing the rates of offending behaviors
by moderated players.
Server 3 had the most extensive community guidelines, the highest ratio of moderators to players, and the lowest frequency of sexually explicit, hateful, and severely toxic behavior between users, suggesting the positive impact of strong guidelines.
No significant connection was found between the moderation frequency and rates of toxicity over time, suggesting moderation may be more effective as a short- rather than long-term solution. Further research is needed to understand these relationships

Moderation, both manual and automated, is often believed as key to reducing negative behaviors in games. We assessed the relationship between moderator actions and changes in chatter behavior. To do this, we linked actions in the chat log to incidents in the report log based on their timestamp and anonymized ID. Given the report lag time, we defined incidents as any chats from the user sent within 12 hours of the report. While this excludes incidents with a longer report lag and includes benign chats where the lag was shorter, we felt this best balanced the need to link as many reports as possible without overspecifying. It is important to note that not all reports appear in the chat log as many were for in-game behaviors (i.e., non-chat-related actions) or chats from affiliated Discord channels we could not access.Ã‚Â 

This method was able to link 48 incidents to the chat. We could then compare the number of sexually explicit, hateful, and severely toxic messages sent before and after the moderator action to evaluate the actionÃ¢Â€Â™s effectiveness. The data indicated that all moderation actions led to reductions in the three types of harmful behavior by the actioned user across all servers, with temporary bans being the most successful. Temporary bans reduced actioned usersÃ¢Â€Â™ sexually explicit content by 82%, hate by 93%, and severe toxicity by 85%.Ã‚Â 

Another way to evaluate the impact of moderation norms on toxic activity is to look at differences in harmful behavior across the three servers, which have different content rules and moderator staffing. We observed that the servers have differing rates for sexually explicit, hateful, and severely toxic content. Our analysis shows that Server 3 had the least amount of harmful activity whereas Servers 1 and 2 were not statistically different from each other. Servers 1 and 2 were more sexually explicit (91% and 80% of all content found, respectively), severely toxic (96% and 86% of all content found, respectively), and hateful (78% and 87% of all content found, respectively) than Server 3. Notably, moderation did not seem to impact the rates of harmful behavior over time, as no significant connections were found between the moderation frequency and rates of hate, explicit content and severe toxicity. This last result may be unique to this dataset or unique to the ways in which content moderation is conducted on these servers. Further investment in research and content moderation efforts is needed to understand how moderation can best impact and reform harmful behavior in online gaming.Ã‚Â 

Text analysis: Sexually explicit, hateful, and severely toxic interactions
There is evidence for the normalization of extreme language in gaming spaces using slurs previously only affiliated with white nationalism and hate groups.
The normalization of extreme language in gaming spaces is more common for hateful rather than sexually explicit language.

Across all three servers, we assessed 1,463,891 messages sent by 9,008 unique users from January 1st to March 30th, 2022. While hate speech was our primary incident of interest, we also analyzed the nature and prevalence of sexually explicit language (references to sexual acts, body parts, or other lewd content) and toxicity (severely hateful, aggressive, or disrespectful comments likely to make a user leave a discussion or decline to share their perspective). We wanted to provide a comparison of hate speech to other forms of disruptive online behavior.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

That data was run through both a series of keyword queries and Perspective. Of all the logged chats, 2% (28,254 messages) could be categorized as severely toxic, 1.6% (24,462 messages) as sexually explicit, and 0.5% (7,574 messages) as hateful. Hate speech largely targeted sexuality (e.g. f*g homo) and gender (e.g. b*tch).Ã‚Â 

a. Public versus private chat messages

Our analysis also revealed that rates of harmful behavior differed depending on the message type. There were 21% more hateful messages in public chats versus private chats. Private chats were 9% more sexually explicit than public chats. This difference is important as it highlights the differences in levels of acceptance around hateful language in gaming spaces. It is possible that hateful and/or harassing language is more commonplace and normalized within public spaces whereas sexually explicit language is more likely to be shared user to user. It is also plausible that players use hateful language to provoke outrage or garner attention from the rest of their community. Sharing hateful language in private chats would not give the abusers the satisfaction of being seen by others. Similarly, online radicalization in games often starts with an invitation for other members to join in or acquiesce to hateful language shared in public gaming spaces. Expressing this language publicly, rather than privately, identifies other members of the community who share similar sentiments.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

b. Normalization of hate speech

In addition to formal reports, we examined chat logs for hate speech (e.g., gender-based slurs, insults against LGBTQ+ people) that were not formally reported by the players on the server. We discovered that such slurs and other extremist-adjacent language occur at a detectable level and often go unmoderated. Although these terms were used infrequently, it is noteworthy that on these heavily regulated servers, players still engage with hateful narratives.

Using keyword lists compiled by ADL and Middlebury, we searched unfiltered chat logs for language that is either overtly hateful or employs terms that originate from hateful contexts. Within the language of concern, we found that normalized language occurred most frequentlyÃ¢Â€Â”that is, hateful language integrated into colloquial conversation. For example, of all terms searched in this data set, the extreme term with the highest number of pejorative uses was Ã¢Â€Âœcuck.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Cuck, short for Ã¢Â€ÂœcuckoldÃ¢Â€Â, was adopted as an insult by online communities in the mid-2000s and then popularized by right-wing networks in the mid-2010s, when it was used to castigate anyone whose views were not adequately right-wing. Cuck became associated with the so-called Ã¢Â€Âœalt-rightÃ¢Â€Â movement, which weaponized the term against political opponents to sexually or racially demean them. Reaching its peak relevance during the 2016 presidential election, the term has gradually spread throughout more mainstream communities and is now used by many people who do not understand its contemporary sexist and racist connotations.

Users in these servers also frequently employ gendered expletives and other phrases, which is common for video game communities. Gendered curse words can contribute to intolerance toward women and LGBTQ+ people and are worth addressing. Across servers, players used Ã¢Â€Âœb*tchÃ¢Â€Â hundreds of times and occasionally used meme misspellings like Ã¢Â€ÂœwamenÃ¢Â€Â that are associated with the Ã¢Â€ÂœManosphereÃ¢Â€Â, a loose online community that promotes masculinity, misogyny, and opposition to feminism.

Recommendations

Working with real-time chat data, this deep dive into Minecraft Java servers provided insight into hate and harassment within games. Drawing from our findings, we offer directions for future work within this space.

Increasing Researcher Access to Data
This work highlights the importance of access to server-logged data for scientific analysis.Ã‚Â 
As an industry, allowing access to unfiltered data can provide unprecedented insight into the frequency and nature of interactions between users within gaming spaces. Without this level of data transparency, the games industry cannot identify or address the challenges of hateful, harassing, and toxic behavior.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
In addition to raw data, future research should include the ability to assess the links between moderator actions and chat messages. For example, researchers must be able to determine when a moderator action is performed because of gameplay, voice chat, or text messages (in-game or on third-party software like Discord) to better understand the impact of moderation.
Investing in Content Moderation Efforts and Robust Community Guidelines
Active, effective human moderation and community guidelines appear to be critical to reducing sexually explicit, hateful, and severely toxic behavior in gaming spaces as the server with the most staff and most extensive guidelines had the fewest incidents of these kinds of behaviors.
Industry leaders need to continue investing in moderator training to better understand and respond to toxic behaviors.Ã‚Â 
Additional Research Into Content Moderation and Complementary Tools and Techniques
There is early evidence to suggest that both server rules and moderator-to-player ratio play an important role in the levels of hate and harassment. Further study would help disentangle the positive effects of each.
Moderator intervention seems to reduce individual harmful behavior, but it remains unclear as to whether this holds for server-wide behavior over time. Future work should focus on determining the effects of moderator intervention on non-moderated players.
There is an untapped opportunity to investigate the short- and long-term impact of tools and techniques that enable player accountability and go beyond moderation, such as player verification and globally blocklisting players banned for severe harms. These measures can add responsibility and minimize reoffending.Ã‚Â 
Standardize reporting categories. To better understand the frequency and nature of hate in online spaces, we recommend an industry-wide standardization of moderation reporting, including defined categories and violating offenses with clear descriptions. This would help facilitate future research, particularly in regards to documenting how moderation actions change user behavior over time. The ADL's Disruption and Harms in Online Gaming Framework could be used as the foundation for this effort.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/parents-want-more-transparency-tech-companies,"Children and teenagers are spending more and more time on social media every year. According to a report published by Common Sense Media, teenagers spend an average of nearly an hour and a half on social media each day, making it more popular for that age group than watching television, playing video games, or reading for pleasure. For children aged eight to twelve, 38% have used social media at least once in their lives and 18% use it every day.

However, research shows that disinformation, extremism, hate and harassment proliferate across the social media ecosystem, largely unregulated by tech companies. ADL conducted a survey of parents to assess their level of concern and what changes they would like to see in social media for their children.

What Parents Worry About
As children and teenagers spend increasingly more time on social media, parents are concerned about what their children may be exposed to. Sixty-eight percent of parents are concerned about hate and harassment online. When asked why they feel social media companies should be more transparent about hate speech on their platforms, parents pointed to a range of concerns including cyberbullying, suicide, and fear that online hate speech can lead to ""violent in-person behavior.Ã¢Â€Â

Parents report concerns over tech companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ lack of transparency about what is taking place on their social platforms. Of the parents surveyed, 75% feel it is important for tech companies to share accurate information about the hate speech and harassment taking place on their platforms, but only 30% believe the information these companies currently share is accurate. This is consistent with analysis that tech companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ transparency reporting is inconsistent, hard to find and full of misleading data.

Additionally, 55% of parents agree that information about the prevalence of hate speech and harassment on various social platforms would help inform their decisions about which social platforms their children should use. For example, one parent highlighted the vulnerability of children and the dangers of them being influenced by hate speech online and insisted Ã¢Â€Âœparents should be informed.Ã¢Â€Â Another explained, Ã¢Â€ÂœI think they should be more transparent so people can have the choice to decide if they want to be a part of their platform. Especially when it comes to minors being on the site. Parents need the truth so they can choose accordingly.Ã¢Â€Â

Just 24% of parents in this sample disagreed that the government should require tech companies to publicly report on this type of information. Additionally, more than three quarters (77%) of parents agree that tech companies should be required to make public any changes to their policies regarding what kinds of posts are not allowed on their platforms.

Leaving the Public in the Dark

These survey results highlight the significant concerns parents have about hate and harassment online and their support for greater action and transparency. This concern aligns with other analysis that suggests young people are exposed to a great deal of hate online. In 2021, ADL found that nearly one in 10 multiplayer gamers ages 13 to 17 had been exposed to white-supremacist ideology. An estimated 2.3 million teens each year are exposed to white supremacist ideology in chats for multiplayer games. Additional surveys found that more than one third of children between the ages of 12 and 15 encountered hate speech online. Exposure to hate speech online can impact mental health and has been shown to increase stress.

During her testimony before Congress, former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen revealed how the company hid internal research that highlighted the harm the platform was creating. Haugen said Facebook acts on as little as 3-5% of hate speech. As children and teenagers continue to spend more time online, parents expect social media companies to produce accurate and meaningful transparency reports about the prevalence of hate and harassment on their platforms and the actions they take in response. But tech companies are failing to meet this expectation. Left to their own devices, tech companies choose to leave the public in the dark as to the danger of their platforms.

This survey was conducted by YouGov, a public opinion and data analytics company, on behalf of ADL. YouGov administered the survey online using a random sample of its panel of willing survey participants. This survey was conducted between May 4th and May 5th, 2022 and included 627 parents in the United States. The responding sample was weighted based on census data to provide a representative sample of parents in the United States.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/hate-empire-state-extremism-antisemitism-new-york-2020-2021,"This report examines extremist and antisemitic trends and incidents across New York state during the two-year time period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021, and provides recommendations for combatting these threats. The ADL Center on Extremism (COE) and the Community Security Initiative (CSI), a project of UJA-Federation of NY and JCRC-NY, jointly researched and authored the report.

The last two years have seen a significant proliferation of hate incidents both nationwide and in New York State. These incidents have been rooted, in part, in widespread campaigns of disinformation and conspiracy theories, some of which have animated extremists and fueled antisemitism, resulting in unrest and violence, from the January 6, 2021 insurrection in Washington, D.C. to white supremacist activism to a spike in hate crimes and rising antisemitism.

In Buffalo, New York, a tragic manifestation of this phenomena occurred on May 14, 2022, when a gunman killed 10 people and injured 3 more inside a Tops supermarket. According to an online screed allegedly written by the shooter and posted before the attack, he espoused white supremacist, racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories and claimed his goal was to Ã¢Â€Âœspread awareness to my fellow whites about the real problems the West is facing,Ã¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœencourage further attacks that will eventually start the war that will save the Western world.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

New groups that espouse the same conspiracies and intolerance, such as White Lives Matter, have formed, and already existing neo-Nazi and accelerationist groups have broadened their audience both online and in real-world activities. Other extremist groups such as militia groups and the Proud Boys have shifted their strategies to focus on the local level, disrupting school board meetings and even running for elected positions.Ã‚Â 

New York also leads the nation in antisemitic incidents, according to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. In 2021, the number of reported incidents increased 24% over 2020 numbers, rising from 336 to 416. This included 51 assaults motivated by anti-Jewish bias, the highest number ever recorded by ADL in New York. These numbers also include a spike in antisemitic incidents driven by extreme anti-Israel sentiments during the May 2021 Israel-Hamas war. During this time, incidents motivated by anti-Zionist sentiments included assault, arson threats, and harassment.

Given the rise in extremist threats across the country and the alarming number of antisemitic hate crimes in New York in recent years, COE and CSI began collaborating in 2020 to specifically focus on the security needs of the Jewish communities of New York. In this capacity, the two organizations currently are monitoring and tracking antisemitism, hate and other types of violent extremism in New York and across the country.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/white-supremacist-propaganda-focused-jews-and-immigrants-2024,"In 2024, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) documented white supremacist propaganda distributions in every U.S. state and the District of Columbia, except Hawaii. Our 2024 assessment focuses on messaging-- the common themes behind the thousands upon thousands of propaganda incidents that have plagued American cities across the nation. White supremacist groups chose to respond to current events and the elevation of certain narratives in the media by tailoring their propaganda accordingly. In other cases, groups simply continued to distribute propaganda targeting minority communities with generalized hatred and vitriol.

The majority of white supremacist propaganda distributed in 2024 included antisemitic or anti-immigrant language and themes. Some leaned into both narratives Ã¢Â€Â“ blaming Jews for the existence of AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s non-white immigrant and refugee populations. Recruitment is common as well; white supremacist fliers, stickers, banners and posters almost always include a group name or symbol, a URL, a QR code or a phone number connected to the group.

Themes related to Israel and Zionists also remained popular in white supremacist propaganda, but the sentiment was not as prevalent as it was immediately following the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Similiarly, anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda saw a significant drop in 2024, after a massive jump in 2023.

White supremacist groups and networks use propaganda campaigns to provoke media and online attention, while limiting the risk of individual exposure, arrests and public backlash that often accompany more public activities. Propaganda, which can affect entire communities, allows a small number of people to have an outsized impact.

Further, white supremacists use propaganda to spread antisemitism, racism and other forms of bigotry to intimidate and harass their perceived enemies and so they can recruit new followers. These days, much of that propaganda occurs online, but white supremacists still spend time and effort spreading propaganda in the physical world. They do this to convey hateful messages, spark fear and anxiety in communities targeted by their propaganda distributions and direct people to their online content to attempt to recruit individuals to their cause.

AntisemitismÃ‚Â 
Antisemitism remained a key theme for white supremacist propaganda in 2024. Patriot Front, which remains the most prolific distributor of of white supremacist propaganda as a whole, also led antisemitic distributions. For example, they frequently distrubited red, white and blue fliers and stencils containing the phrase Ã¢Â€ÂœNo Zionists in Government, We serve one Nation.Ã¢Â€Â Given the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s neo-Nazi roots, there is little question that when Patriot Front mentions Ã¢Â€ÂœZionists,Ã¢Â€Â they mean Jews.

The antisemitic Goyim Defense League (GDL) continued to distribute propaganda that casts aspersions on Jews and spreads antisemitic myths and conspiracy theories in hopes of turning Americans against Jewish people.Ã‚Â GDLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2024 propaganda included baseless charges aboutÃ‚Â Jewish power,Ã‚Â blamed Jews for 9/11 and accused Jews ofÃ‚Â blood libel and pedophilia.

ADL documented propaganda distributions by the New England White Network (NEWN) for the first time in 2024. The small, New Hampshire-based group put postcard-style propaganda on community bulletin boards, along hiking trails and on magazine racks.Ã‚Â One of NEWNÃ¢Â€Â™s antisemitic fliers titled Ã¢Â€ÂœBoycott Jewish businesses,Ã¢Â€Â encouraged white New EnglandersÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â start Ã¢Â€Âœseparating themselves from Jewry as a whole.Ã¢Â€Â The card blamed HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) and other immigration agencies for replacing white New Englanders with non-white immigrants. NEWN also distributed antisemitic postcards titled Ã¢Â€ÂœBidenÃ¢Â€Â™s Slew of Jews,Ã¢Â€Â claiming the Biden administration was Ã¢Â€Âœsaturated by subversive, loxist [sic], supremacist kikes.Ã¢Â€Â

Like NEWN, propaganda from the Florida-based National Socialist Front (NSF) included fliers that blamedÃ‚Â HIAS for AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s immigration crisis. Another NSF flier, distributed in California,Ã‚Â condemned the U.S. House Resolution 6090, known as theÃ‚Â Antisemitism Awareness Act of 2023. The flier,Ã‚Â titled Ã¢Â€ÂœStand Against Zionism,Ã¢Â€Â stated, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe say enough! Americans, reject Jewish control!Ã¢Â€Â

Previously active primarily in Florida and Texas, Order of the Black Sun, a small neo-Nazi group, distributed propaganda around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœCaution! ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s [sic] kikes in your area,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœJews control mass immigrationÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœJews control pornography.Ã¢Â€Â

Several groups and networks also distributed antisemitic propaganda specifically mentioning Israel and Zionism including the Active Club network, American Blackshirts and theÃ‚Â New Jersey European Heritage Association (NJEHA).

White supremacists sharply focused their hate on immigrants and refugees in 2024, framing migrants as Ã¢Â€ÂœinvadersÃ¢Â€Â and therefore a threat to white Americans.

In September 2024, following a viral, racist disinformation campaign focused on Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, a range of white supremacist groups held demonstrations and distributed anti-immigrant propaganda in the city. Patriot Front hung a banner that read Ã¢Â€Âœdeport them allÃ¢Â€Â on an area overpass; individuals associated with theÃ‚Â White Lives Matter (WLM) network held a banner in front of city hall that read in both English and Haitian Creole, Ã¢Â€ÂœHaitians Have No Home Here;Ã¢Â€Â the Ohio chapter of theÃ‚Â Aryan Freedom Network posted images of recruitment propaganda they claimed to have distributed in the area; and there were reports of fliers promoting theÃ‚Â Trinity White Knights that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœForeigners & Haitians Out.Ã¢Â€Â

Patriot FrontÃ¢Â€Â™s anti-immigrant propaganda heavily reflected their belief that Americans of European ancestry have an exclusive right to live in the U.S.Ã‚Â with slogans such as Ã¢Â€Âœkeep America American,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Âœdeport them allÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœdeport invaders.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Propaganda from the NJEHA urged people to report Ã¢Â€Âœillegal aliensÃ¢Â€Â to U.S. Immigration and Customs. Another called for the arrest of Ã¢Â€Âœsanctuary mayors.Ã¢Â€Â

Both the Active Club and WLM networks also increased their focus on anti-immigrant themes in their propaganda. The networks referred to the presence of immigrants and refugees in America as Ã¢Â€Âœan invasion,Ã¢Â€Â with phrases such as Ã¢Â€Âœstop the invasionÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœremove all invaders.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Several WLM chaptersÃ‚Â distributed propaganda using the white supremacist slogan Ã¢Â€ÂœAuslander Raus!Ã¢Â€Â which translates to Ã¢Â€Âœforeigners out.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

The ADL Center on Extremism also tracked an uptick in anti-immigrant propaganda from both the American Freedom Party (AFP) andÃ‚Â American Blackshirts in 2024. Many stickers and posters distributed by the groups had slogans such as Ã¢Â€ÂœInvaders are here for conquest, not asylum,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœSmash immigration, invaders get out,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerica for Americans! Invaders Out!Ã¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœItÃ¢Â€Â™s not immigration itÃ¢Â€Â™s an invasion.Ã¢Â€Â

Sampling of anti-immigrant propaganda.

Other Findings

Though the narratives described above were used the most in white supremacist propaganda last year, white supremacists still distributed anti-LGBTQ+ and racist propganda in 2024. For example, on May 10, 2024, WLM and GDL both distributed propaganda that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœEvery Single Aspect of the LGBTQ+ Movement is JewishÃ¢Â€Â in Three Rivers, Michigan. The Aryan Freedom Network also distributed fliers that read Ã¢Â€ÂœStraight PrideÃ¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â with their typical recruitment fliers during Pride Month.

In addition to the racist and anti-immigrant propaganda campaigns targeting the Haitian community in Springfield, Ohio, white supremacist propaganda containing overt racism persisted in 2024. For example, on April 24, 2024, two individuals associated with WLM held a demonstration outside of an elementary school holding signs that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœEnd Black Violence! Protect White Children!Ã¢Â€Â The group also distributed white supremacist propaganda nearby that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite Lives Matter,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœStop White ReplacementÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœMake White Children.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Additionally, on July 9, 2024, residents in several neighborhoods across Johnson County, Indiana, were targeted with racist stickers from the neo-Nazi group, National Alliance that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœNA [National Alliance] Health Warning #1 for White women and girls. Straight Black males are infected with HIV at a rate over 19 times the rate of straight White males. The media wonÃ¢Â€Â™t warn you, but the National Alliance will.Ã¢Â€Â

White supremacist propaganda referencing alleged crimes committed against white people by Black people also remained popular. For example, in June 2024, after a period of inactivity, Eastern NC Active Club began distributing unique WLM stickers memorializing victims of alleged crimes with white victims and alleged Black perpetrators.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/white-supremacist-propaganda-focused-jews-and-immigrants-2024,"New York, NY, March 27, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â¦ In 2024, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) documented white supremacist propaganda distributions in every U.S. state and the District of Columbia, except Hawaii. The 2024 assessment focused on the common themes behind the thousands of propaganda incidents that plagued American cities across the nation, finding that most of the white supremacist propaganda distributed included antisemitic or anti-immigrant language.Ã‚Â 

Some groups leaned into both of these narratives Ã¢Â€Â“ blaming Jews for the existence of AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s non-white immigrant and refugee populations. In other cases, groups simply continued distributing propaganda targeting all minority communities with generalized hatred and vitriol.Ã‚Â Recruitment is another common theme; white supremacist fliers, stickers, banners and posters almost always include a group name or symbol, a URL, a QR code or a phone number connected to the group.

Themes related to Israel and Zionists also remained popular in white supremacist propaganda, but the sentiment was not as prevalent as it was immediately following the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Similarly, anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda saw a significant drop in 2024, after a massive jump in 2023.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWhite supremacist groups use propaganda campaigns to provoke media and online attention, recruit new members, and to intimidate and harass Jews, immigrants and other marginalized groups,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe findings from this report remind us that our mission is as relevant today as it was more than a century ago as antisemitism and hate of all forms are still rampant. We will continue to fight hateful rhetoric and propaganda with relevant stakeholders to effectively protect these harassed communities.Ã¢Â€Â

""Hateful propaganda allows a small group of extremists to spread fear and distrust throughout entire communities,"" said Oren Segal, ADL Senior Vice President for Counter-Extremism and Intelligence. ""To combat these efforts, we must expose those responsible. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why the ADL Center for Extremism remains committed to tracking these groups and their activity, and to documenting the toxic and hateful narratives they push through propaganda.""Ã‚Â 

Key findings from ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2024 assessment include:Ã‚Â 

Patriot Front remains the most prolific distributor of white supremacist propaganda as a whole, including antisemitic distributions.
The antisemiticÃ‚Â Goyim Defense League (GDL)Ã‚Â continued to distribute propaganda that casts aspersions on Jews and spreads antisemitic myths and conspiracy theories in hopes of turning Americans against Jewish people. GDLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2024 propaganda included baseless charges about Jewish power, blamed Jews for 9/11 and accused Jews of blood libel and pedophilia.
ADL documented propaganda distributions by theÃ‚Â New England White Network (NEWN) for the first time in 2024. The small, New Hampshire-based group put postcard-style propaganda on community bulletin boards, along hiking trails and on magazine racks. One of NEWNÃ¢Â€Â™s antisemitic fliers titled Ã¢Â€ÂœBoycott Jewish businesses,Ã¢Â€Â encouraged white New Englanders to start Ã¢Â€Âœseparating themselves from Jewry as a whole.Ã¢Â€Â
White supremacists sharply focused their hate on immigrants and refugees in 2024, framing migrants as Ã¢Â€ÂœinvadersÃ¢Â€Â and therefore a threat to white Americans. This came into sharp focus in September 2024, following a viral, racist disinformation campaign focused on Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, a range of white supremacist groups held demonstrations and distributed anti-immigrant propaganda in the city, includingÃ‚Â Patriot Front, theÃ‚Â White Lives Matter Network, the Ohio chapter of theÃ‚Â Aryan Freedom Network and theÃ‚Â Trinity Freedom Network.Ã‚Â 

The antisemitic incidents referenced in this assessment are also part of ADL's Audit of Antisemitic Incidents and will be included in the ""2024 Antisemitic Incident"" dataset detailed in the ADL H.E.A.T. Map.

We know that social media platforms play a large role in spreading hate speech, racism, and misinformation. In FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s case, blockbuster disclosures by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former product manager on the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s now-disbanded civic integrity team, revealed that the company buried internal research showing it was aware of the ways the platform creates societal harm.

Transparency reports are supposed to track platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ enforcement of their content moderation rules. Ideally, such reporting forces platforms to be explicit about their policies on hate, harassment, and misinformation, and apply their rules consistently.

Instead, platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ transparency reports have failed to provide meaningful information about the prevalence and impact of hateful content. These reports are confusing, uninformative, and evasive. Platform transparency reports end up serving as a deflection away from the fact that we have very little insight into how platforms manage the ecosystem of hate onlineÃ¢Â€Â”and they have little to no legal or financial incentives to give us that access.

Compared to tech companiesÃ¢Â€Â™ financial reports, transparency reports are inconsistent from report to report, share only cherry-picked data, and are based on guidelines set by the companies themselves, giving them wide latitude over what counts as hate or harassment.

ADL analyzed Facebook and TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s transparency reports (and touched upon YouTube) and found four major problems, from inconsistency to misleading metrics, resulting in reports that are anything but transparent.

1. Reports Are Hard to FindÃ‚Â 

The major social media platforms publish regular reports, usually quarterly or semi-annually, but finding them can be tricky. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube (owned by Google) have established transparency centers to consolidate all their reports, but they are not organized optimally.

TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s 2021 Transparency Center

Trying to find a transparency report on these platforms, we found, is a labyrinthine exercise. ADL researchers clicked through eight different pages, starting from the home page, to find Twitter's latest Rules Enforcement transparency report. It is telling that readers must expend a lot of energy searching for information that should be readily accessible.

TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s Transparency Center timeline

TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s recently updated transparency center, for example, shows a timeline of its transparency efforts since co-founder Biz Stone defended its relatively hands-off policy in 2011. In his post, Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Tweets Must Flow,Ã¢Â€Â he explained how Twitter then defined violative content narrowly, in his words, Ã¢Â€Âœto allow for freedom of expression.Ã¢Â€Â The companyÃ¢Â€Â™s first official transparency report was published in 2012 and focused on legal requests such as copyright takedowns. After 2013, Twitter produced reports with more frequency. Twitter only began releasing information about content removed for Terms of Service (TOS) violations in 2016.

Broken link to TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s 2017 transparency report

In 2017, Twitter rebranded these reports as Ã¢Â€ÂœRules Enforcement,Ã¢Â€Â but the link to that 2017 report is broken (see above), a common issue in trying to track transparency reports over time.

FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s section on transparency reports within its Transparency Center

Facebook similarly launched a new Ã¢Â€ÂœTransparency CenterÃ¢Â€Â in May 2021, but when we clicked the link to Ã¢Â€Âœtransparency reports,Ã¢Â€Â it took us to a newsroom post about the report. (In good news, the latest report is now listed under Ã¢Â€ÂœTransparency ReportsÃ¢Â€Â and is easier to find). A link in that newsroom post directed us to the current report from August 2021 which Facebook says is its tenth, although the prior nine reports are not listed (they can be found with enough digging). ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no PDF to download (although the data can be downloaded as a spreadsheet), making it difficult to track FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s reported data over time.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s latest Community Standards Enforcement report

Searching via Google for the report didnÃ¢Â€Â™t solve the problem of finding past reports eitherÃ¢Â€Â”older links to FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s transparency reports redirect to the current Transparency Center. Further adding to our confusion, Facebook also publishes, or used to publish, a biannual Transparency Report, separate from the Community Standards Enforcement report. The link from the newsroom release about the biannual Transparency Report just sent us back to the new Transparency Center. In the end, we couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t find a separate Transparency Report (perhaps itÃ¢Â€Â™s been replaced by the new reportsÃ¢Â€Â”it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t clear).

Close-up of TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s timeline feature, showing the August 2020 launch of its Transparency Center

TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s timeline feature (the way to see past transparency reports) is more navigable, yet the link to the page announcing the new Transparency Center mentions a 16th Transparency Report without providing any link (unless the post itself is the report).

Our failed search for TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s 16th transparency report

Despite hours of digging through Twitter and FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s transparency centers, it was excessively difficult to find past reports or make sense of how past reports compare to the latest ones.

2. Content Is Inconsistent Across Reports

While platforms claim that they provide the public with troves of data in their Ã¢Â€ÂœregularÃ¢Â€Â transparency reports, we found that the categories of data were inconsistent, making it hard to compare changes year over year. LetÃ¢Â€Â™s look at the latest Twitter Rules Enforcement Report for July-December 2020 as an example. For the purpose of looking at the scope of online hate and harassment, we looked at content moderation and enforcement of terms of service (FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s equivalent is its Community Standards Enforcement Report).Ã‚Â 

Twitter Transparency Center, Rules Enforcement report for July-Dec. 2020

Facebook and Twitter have over time expanded what their reports cover, which is an improvement in their overall transparency. In 2012, for example, Twitter only reported on takedown requests and government requests for user data; now, it reports on Rules Enforcement, Platform Manipulation, Email Security, and more. But because the content has varied from year to year, it is difficult to compare trends over time.

Twitter Transparency Center, section on Twitter Rules enforcement reports

TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s latest Rules Enforcement report is listed under Ã¢Â€ÂœTwitter Rules,Ã¢Â€Â rather than Rules Enforcement or similar. This section name might confuse some readers, since itÃ¢Â€Â™s also the name of TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s rules and policies.

The report is downloadable, but the download link generates a PDF thatÃ¢Â€Â™s missing half the textÃ¢Â€Â”another barrier to saving and tracking these reports over time.

The PDF of the report we downloaded, which cuts off much of the text (no, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not cropped)

So we read the charts on the website instead. The first chart, out of three, shows a bar view of Ã¢Â€ÂœLatest Data: Accounts Actioned.Ã¢Â€Â LetÃ¢Â€Â™s take a closer look.

Twitter Rules Enforcement report for July-Dec. 2020, Accounts Actioned chart, bar view

The word Ã¢Â€ÂœactionedÃ¢Â€Â merits further discussion, as an industry term thatÃ¢Â€Â™s open to interpretation. For social media platforms, Ã¢Â€Âœactioning contentÃ¢Â€Â can mean taking it down, de-ranking it, labeling it, reinstating appealed content, or engaging in other methods of content moderation.

The data appear impressive at first glance: 3.5 million accounts actioned, 1 million suspended, 4.5 million with Ã¢Â€Âœcontent removed.Ã¢Â€Â What do these terms or numbers actually mean, though? How many Tweets were removed for content violations? What counts as being Ã¢Â€ÂœactionedÃ¢Â€Â? The graph shows an increase in accounts actioned over time, suggesting Twitter has improved, but offers no clarity on what the terms mean, calling that implied conclusion into question.

Twitter Rules Enforcement report for July-Dec. 2020, Accounts Actioned chart, table view

When we clicked through to Ã¢Â€ÂœTableÃ¢Â€Â view (above), we saw the numbers in more detail. Notably, the report doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t show the number of accounts actioned as a proportion of total Twitter accounts. Were there more Twitter accounts in 2020 than 2019 or 2018? Is the platform actually reducing the percentage of violative content or was there just more content on the platform overall? This is an example of missing fractions, where an important part of an equation is left out, such as the numerator or the denominator, in an attempt to manipulate statistics to look better. Since we donÃ¢Â€Â™t know the denominator (how many accounts there were in 2020 vs. 2019 or 2018), itÃ¢Â€Â™s impossible to know if the aggregate number improved.Ã‚Â 

3. Key Metrics Can Be Misleading

Each platform uses different metrics to evaluate its enforcement, beyond the total quantity of content removed. These metrics each measure different things, making it hard to compare how each platform is moderating content. What do these numbers actually tell us?

In July 2021, Twitter introduced a new metric, Ã¢Â€Âœimpressions,Ã¢Â€Â referring to the number of views a Tweet receives before being removed, as a Twitter blog post explains:

We continue to explore ways to share more context and details about how we enforce the Twitter Rules. As such, we are introducing a new metricÃ¢Â€Â“impressionsÃ¢Â€Â“for enforcement actions where we required the removal of specific Tweets. Impressions capture the number of views a Tweet received prior to removal.

YouTube similarly has the Ã¢Â€ÂœViolative View Rate,Ã¢Â€Â introduced in April 2021.

We will release a new metric called Violative View Rate (VVR) as part of our Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. The report will have a separate section called Ã¢Â€Â˜ViewsÃ¢Â€Â™ which will lay out historical and the Q4 (Oct-Dec 2020) VVR data, along with details on its methodology. Going forward, we will be updating this data quarterly. VVR helps us estimate the percentage of the views on YouTube that come from violative content.

Facebook does not have a single comparable key metric to TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s impressions or YouTubeÃ¢Â€Â™s Violative View Rate.

FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s quarterly report instead includes multiple metrics: hate speech prevalence (hate speech viewed as a percentage of total content); the Ã¢Â€Âœproactive rateÃ¢Â€Â (Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â‹Ã¢Â€Â‹the percentage of content we took action on that we found before a user reported it to usÃ¢Â€Â); and Ã¢Â€Âœcontent actionedÃ¢Â€Â (Ã¢Â€Âœhow much content we took action on because it was found to violate our policiesÃ¢Â€Â), among others. Like YouTubeÃ¢Â€Â™s Violative View Rate, TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€ÂœimpressionsÃ¢Â€Â metric claims to show how many people saw a tweet that broke TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s rules, rather than how long it was up before it was flagged or removed:

From July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, Twitter removed 3.8M Tweets that violated the Twitter Rules. Of the Tweets removed, 77% received fewer than 100 impressions, with an additional 17% receiving between 100 and 1000 impressions. Only 6% of removed Tweets had more than 1000 impressions. In total, impressions on violative Tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of all impressions for all Tweets during that time period.

Six percent of 3.8 million Tweets is 228,000 (17% is 646,000, so combined, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s 874,000 tweets that Twitter says violated its rules and received over 100 views each). WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s the broader impact of harmful content Twitter doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t catch or remove? And since accounts with large follower counts are influential, even a single tweet from a popular user (say, the rapper Nicki Minaj on the Covid-19 vaccine) has the considerable power to misinform.

4. Crucial Context Is Missing

Not only are these key metrics often misleading, but thereÃ¢Â€Â™s insufficient context needed to make sense of their significance. TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s rules enforcement report provides Ã¢Â€Âœanalysis,Ã¢Â€Â identifying which rules were violated. Ã‚Â 

Twitter Rules Enforcement report for July-Dec. 2020, section 3, Analysis chart, bar view

TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s top categories (based on its safety rules) separate out hateful conduct, abuse/harassment (targeted harassment and threats of harm), and sensitive media (graphic violence and adult/sexual content). Yet, as ADL research on trolling shows, the content in all of these categories can be part of networked harassment (ongoing harassment campaigns across multiple platforms) that target Jewish professionals, trans women, and women of color, among others. Other methods of harassment, such as doxing (which is listed under privacy violations), are reported separately, making the harassment numbers seem lower. It may also be unclear to those targeted how to categorize and report these kinds of violations.

More context is needed to interpret these numbers. Who is seeing the offending tweets? How many tweets are removed by proactive detection and how many are flagged by users? How long does it take to remove content or Ã¢Â€ÂœactionÃ¢Â€Â an account once reported? For targets of harassment campaigns, the consequences of such abuse are considerable, and often involve multiple Tweets and accounts, which makes reporting stressful and onerous.

Twitter Help Center, abusive behavior, section on consequences for violating the abusive behavior rule

While Twitter highlights how many accounts it took action against (such as by muting or suspending temporarily), Twitter doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t mention its high bar for suspending usersÃ¢Â€Â™ accounts. It is unclear how many times users can violate the platformÃ¢Â€Â™s rules before their accounts are disabled; instead of giving a clear answer, Twitter provides a link to the platform enforcement Rules.

Users who violate the Ã¢Â€Âœabusive behaviorÃ¢Â€Â rule, for example, may be asked to remove content or are temporarily blocked from tweeting (as shown above). If they are caught breaking the rules again, theyÃ¢Â€Â™ll be blocked from posting for longer (and unspecified) periods of time. TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s explanation offers few concrete details such as how many times one can violate the rules before being suspended:

For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can Tweet again. Subsequent violations will lead to longer read-only periods and may eventually result in permanent suspension. If an account is engaging primarily in abusive behavior, we may permanently suspend the account upon initial review.

ItÃ¢Â€Â™s unclear from the report how many actions were taken (such as removing content) versus how many accounts total were censured in some way. For accounts that violated TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s rules on hateful conduct, abuse/harassment, and sensitive media, Twitter was far more likely to take temporary actions, such as muting or removing content (2,798,428 accounts) than more permanent moves like suspension or deletion (286,818 accounts, which is 10% of those actioned in some way and 7% of accounts with content removed).

In contrast, Twitter acts decisively against content violations that clearly break the lawÃ¢Â€Â”it suspended far more accounts for child sexual exploitation (464,804) versus removing content from such accounts (9,178). Twitter clearly has the ability to take down content that violates its rules, when itÃ¢Â€Â™s willing to make such determinations.Ã‚Â 

Twitter Rules Enforcement report for July-Dec. 2020, safety violations

Crucial context is missing from other sections of TwitterÃ¢Â€Â™s rules enforcement report as well. The section on Ã¢Â€ÂœSafetyÃ¢Â€Â focuses on violence, harassment, sexual content, and the like. Without context, itÃ¢Â€Â™s hard to know how to interpret these numbers. Twitter doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t report how many flags or automated detections were dismissed, only how many times it took action.Ã‚Â 

Twitter Rules Enforcement report for July-Dec. 2020, safety violations (continued)

There was a 142% increase in accounts actioned for abuse/harassment, 77% for hate, 322% increase for sensitive media (not shown), and 192% for suicide or self-harm. The latter might be the result of the many mental-health crises prompted by the pandemic, but why did general violence go up 106% while terrorism/violent extremism went down 35%? Given Twitter CEO Jack DorseyÃ¢Â€Â™s admission during Congressional testimony that the platform played a role in the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, this figure on terrorism raises questions.

Twitter Rules Enforcement report for July-Dec. 2020, privacy violations

Although Twitter reports removing most harmful content through a combination of Ã¢Â€ÂœproactiveÃ¢Â€Â detection and user flagging, the Rules Enforcement report doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t quantify the impact of hateful or abusive content that remains. Privacy violations, as mentioned earlier, are treated as separate from abuse or hate, including doxing and non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery (sometimes called Ã¢Â€Âœrevenge pornÃ¢Â€Â), which are frequent and exceedingly damaging forms of harassment. Similarly, impersonation (not shown) is listed under Ã¢Â€ÂœAuthenticity,Ã¢Â€Â yet is also a tactic harassers use against targets.

Like Twitter, FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s transparency reports are unreliable at best and misleading at worst.

FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s latest Community Standards Enforcement report for Q2 2021 details metrics such as prevalence, content actioned, and proactive rate, defined earlier, for each category of content that breaks its rules. Crucial categories are missing, like mis- and disinformation.

Documents uncovered by whistleblower Frances Haugen show that Facebook removes a much smaller percentage of hateful and abusive content than the company has claimed. Contrary to FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s claims of how much hateful content the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s biggest social media company removes, an internal study disclosed by Haugen showed that the company actions as little as 3-5% of hateful content and 0.6% of content invoking violence and incitement.

In FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s first quarterly Community Standards Enforcement report from 2020, the company claimed that it had increased its moderation of content in Spanish, Arabic, and Indonesian and described unspecified improvements to its English moderation technology:

Our proactive detection rate for hate speech on Facebook increased 6 points from 89% to 95%. In turn, the amount of content we took action on increased from 9.6 million in Q1 to 22.5 million in Q2. This is because we expanded some of our automation technology in Spanish, Arabic and Indonesian and made improvements to our English detection technology in Q1. In Q2, improvements to our automation capabilities helped us take action on more content in English, Spanish and Burmese.

FacebookÃ¢Â€Â™s latest report from Q2 2021, however, doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t categorize content actioned by language or explain the direct impact of the increase in Spanish, Arabic, and Indonesian content moderation. This omission makes it difficult to compare quarterly results of content moderation by language, and may give a false impression of improvement. Facebook claims the prevalence of hate speech dropped by .05% in Q2 2021. Where did it drop geographically? Which language did it drop in? Did it rise in some markets? What type of hate speech? What was the scope of the technology used to categorize it? The companyÃ¢Â€Â™s numbers donÃ¢Â€Â™t provide any insight into whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s making meaningful progress.

What Should Platforms Do?

In contrast to these reports, Facebook and other platforms provide much clearer, more consistent financial reports, as mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, they provide more thorough transparency reporting for Ã¢Â€Âœobviously illegal contentÃ¢Â€Â in Germany, as required by the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s NetzDG law.

To be worthwhile, transparency reporting must: a) be consistent from report to report in terms of numbers and categories of violations; b) provide context for terminology, exceptions to rules or changes; and c) be comprehensive. High-quality reporting means not just publishing numbers, but explaining the significance of those numbers. Readers should be able to understand how such content is flagged or detected, how much reported content stays up, whether flagged content will be removed or otherwise Ã¢Â€Âœactioned,Ã¢Â€Â and what types of Ã¢Â€ÂœactionsÃ¢Â€Â are possible.

Transparency reporting is necessary to ensure platforms actually enforce their terms of service, which Facebook and other platforms have shown again and again that they fail to do. Enforcing terms of service is a key step in providing space for discourse and social connection thatÃ¢Â€Â™s free from hate, abuse, discrimination, harassment, and violence. Unchecked, hateful and extremist content pushes women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and other marginalized groups out of online spaces.

We Need Government Action

If thereÃ¢Â€Â™s one important takeaway from our analysis, itÃ¢Â€Â™s that Big Tech cannot be trusted to regulate itself. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s time for real transparency.Ã‚Â 

Government mandates and oversight are necessary so the public can understand how platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ practices affect society. This is why ADL supports CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s social media transparency bill, AB 587, as a necessary step in the direction of compelling tech companies to undertake more comprehensive reporting. The bill would require social media platforms to publicly disclose their policies regarding online hate/racism, disinformation, extremism, and harassment, as well as key metrics and data around the enforcement of those policies. The disclosure would be accomplished through biannual and quarterly public filings with the Attorney General to:

Disclose corporate policies, if any, regarding:Ã‚Â 
Hate speech and racismÃ‚Â 
Disinformation or misinformation, including health disinformation, election disinformation, and conspiracy theoriesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 
Extremism, including threats of violence against government entitiesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 
HarassmentÃ‚Â 
Foreign political interferenceÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 
Disclose efforts to enforce those policies.Ã‚Â 
Disclose any changes to policies or enforcement.Ã‚Â 
Disclose key metrics and data regarding the categories of content above, including:
number of pieces of content, groups, and users flagged for violation
method of flagging (e.g., human reviewers, artificial intelligence, etc.)
number of actions
type of content action and flagged

We cannot leave it up to social media platforms to give us a clear understanding of the scope of online hate and who is affected.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/adl-debunk-disinformation-and-blm-protests,"The May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism. As the demonstrations spread to communities across the country, so too did disinformation about the protests and protesters. In a time of national unrest and racial tension, these false claims intentionally sowed fear and division, while also undermining protestersÃ¢Â€Â™ efforts to build coalitions and bring about lasting structural change.

Researchers in ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Center on Extremism documented a range of examples of disinformation related to the protests. These campaigns often included the deliberate mischaracterization of groups or movements, such as portraying activists who support Black Lives Matter as violent extremists or claiming that antifa is a terrorist organization coordinated or manipulated by nebulous external forces. ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s researchers found evidence of white supremacists creating or promoting some of these fabricated claims and rumors to further their own agendas. Certain pieces of disinformation which originally appeared years ago have reemerged in the context of the current protests. In some cases, unsubstantiated rumors migrated from digital platforms to physical-world responses.

It is important to note that the following list is not intended to be a comprehensive collection of all misinformation and disinformation circulating about the protests. Rather, it is a sampling of specifically extremist-related and hate-based disinformation campaigns around the ongoing Black Lives Matter demonstrations. It is also important to understand that the Black Lives Matter movement is a decentralized, grassroots movement that is not directed by a particular Black Lives Matter organization.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/anti-jewish-and-anti-israel-bias-found-leading-ai-models-new-adl-report,"New York, NY, March 25, 2025, Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (The Anti-Defamation League) released today theÃ‚Â most comprehensive evaluation to date of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel bias in major large language models (LLMs) - GPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), and Llama (Meta).

The ADLÃ‚Â Center for Technology and Society, in collaboration with ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Ratings and Assessments Institute, evaluated responses from four leading AI models, and uncovered concerning patterns of bias, misinformation, and selective engagement on issues related to Jewish people, Israel, and antisemitic tropes in all four of these AI models.

Ã¢Â€ÂœArtificial intelligence is reshaping how people consume information, but as this research shows, AI models are not immune to deeply ingrained societal biases,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO of ADL. Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen LLMs amplify misinformation or refuse to acknowledge certain truths, it can distort public discourse and contribute to antisemitism. This report is an urgent call to AI developers to take responsibility for their products and implement stronger safeguards against bias.""

Key Findings from the Report:

All four LLMs exhibited measurable anti-Jewish and anti-Israel bias, though the degree and nature of bias varied across models.
MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s Llama model displayed the most pronounced anti-Jewish and anti-Israel biases, providing unreliable and sometimes outright false responses to questions related to Jewish people and Israel. As the only open-source model in the assessed group, Llama was found to be the lowest scoring model for both bias and reliability. Additionally, Llama is the only model whose lowest score was on a question about the role of Jews in theÃ‚Â great replacement conspiracy theory.
GPT and Claude showed significant anti-Israel bias, particularly in responses regarding the Israel-Hamas war, where they struggled to provide consistent, fact-based answers.
LLMs refused to answer questions about Israel more frequently than other topics, reflecting a troubling inconsistency in how AI models handle political and historical subjects.
AI models demonstrated a concerning inability to accurately reject antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories, highlighting the persistent challenges in preventing AI from amplifying misinformation.

Ã¢Â€ÂœLLMs are already embedded in classrooms, workplaces, and social media moderation decisions, yet our findings show they are not adequately trained to prevent the spread of antisemitism and anti-Israel misinformation,Ã¢Â€Â said Daniel Kelley, Interim Head of the ADL Center for Technology and Society. Ã¢Â€ÂœAI companies must take proactive steps to address these failures, from improving their training data to refining their content moderation policies. We are committed to working with industry leaders to ensure these systems do not become vectors for hate and misinformation.Ã¢Â€Â

As AI continues to shape public discourse, its role in disseminating biasÃ¢Â€Â”whether intentional or inadvertentÃ¢Â€Â”has profound implications. These systems are increasingly used in education, workplaces, and public communications, making it critical to ensure they do not reinforce harmful stereotypes or misinformation. To address these findings, the report formulates recommendations.

Recommendations for Developers:

Conduct rigorous pre-deployment testing in partnership with academia, civil society, and governments.
Carefully consider the usefulness, reliability, and potential biases of training data.
Follow the NIST Risk Management FrameworkÃ‚Â (RMF) for AI. Ã‚Â 

Recommendations for Government:

Ensure that efforts to encourage AI also have built-in focus to ensure the safety of content and uses. Ã‚Â 
Prioritize a regulatory framework that would include requirements that AI developers follow industry trust and safety best practices.
Invest inÃ‚Â AI safety research so that society can achieve the gains of AI while mitigating the harms. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

This research was conducted in partnership with Builders for Tomorrow (BFT), a venture philanthropy and research organization focused on combating anti-Jewish and anti-West ideologies.Ã‚Â 

ADL assessed these AI tools by asking each model to indicate a level of agreement with various statements in six categories related to antisemitism and anti-Israel bias and analyzed patterns among the results. Each LLM was queried 8,600 times for a total of 34,400 responses. A similar methodology has been used to evaluate other forms of bias such asÃ‚Â political bias,Ã‚Â implicit reasoning bias, andÃ‚Â steerability bias, among others. This project represents the first stage of a broader ADL examination of LLMs and antisemitic bias. The findings shared in this report underscore the need for improved safeguards and mitigation strategies across the AI industry.

The ADL Center for Technology and Society and ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Ratings and Assessments Institute will continue to evaluate AI bias and push for greater accountability in the development of AI technologies. This report represents the first step in an ongoing effort to track and mitigate biases in artificial intelligence.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/survey-jewish-americans-experiences-antisemitism,"In the face of unprecedented attacks on the Jewish community, ADL conducted a survey of Jewish Americans to explore their experiences with antisemitism. We not only asked about peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s experiences -- from online harassment to overhearing hateful slurs to being physically attacked -- but we also explored the impact of these experiences.

Antisemitic Experiences

Over half (54%) of Jews in America have either experienced or witnessed some form of incident that they believed was motivated by antisemitism over the past five years1. About half (49%) of Jews have heard antisemitic comments, slurs or threats targeted at others. One-in-five (21%) have been the target of antisemitism comments, slurs or threats. The same number (22%) report vandalization, damage or defacement of a Jewish institution they are associated with because of antisemitism. One-in-seven (14%) had someone they knew physically attacked because they were Jewish. One-in-twenty have had their home, car or property deliberately vandalized or defaced because of antisemitism (6%) or have been physically attacked (5%).

Jews also commonly encounter antisemitism online. One-in-seven (14%) experienced some form of harassment and over one-in-ten (11%) have experienced a severe form of harassment such as being physically threatened as a result of their religion.2

How worried are you about the following things happening in your community?

Nearly two thirds of Jews (63%) reported that they are less safe than they were a decade ago. Many Jewish-Americans are concerned about themselves, their institutions and their community. Most are concerned about attacks centered around their place of worship: More than half (51%) are worried about a violent attack at a synagogue or about a synagogue being defaced, damaged or vandalized.

Similar numbers of Jewish people are worried about their community members: Roughly half are worried that a person wearing a yarmulke, religious skullcap or other public display of Judaism will be physically assaulted (47%) or verbally harassed (50%) on the street or in a public place.

A smaller but substantial proportion are worried about being personally targeted: More than a third (36%) are worried about verbal assaults directed toward them personally, and more than a quarter (27%) are worried about a hate-motivated physical attack.

In the face of widespread anxiety about antisemitic attacks, some Jewish-Americans have modified their behaviors to minimize the risk of being targeted. More than one-in-four (27%) have employed at least one strategy to avoid being targeted. The most common strategy, adopted by more than one-in-ten (12%) Jews, is avoiding markers of Jewish identification -- for instance, by not using oneÃ¢Â€Â™s last name, covering or not wearing a Jewish star, or not identifying as Jewish on a social media site. Almost one-in-ten (9%) have avoided wearing religious clothing or accessories.

Less common strategies Jewish individuals used to avoid antisemitic attacks included avoiding non-Jewish areas, businesses or institutions for fear of being targeted (5%), avoiding posting or displaying a mezuzah (5%), taking steps toward emigration (4%) or avoiding Jewish institutions (3%).

As a result of Jewish peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s experiences with online hate and harassment, some have experienced emotional hardship. More than one-in-ten (11%) have had trouble sleeping, had trouble concentrating or felt anxious. Small numbers have taken steps to reduce risk to physical safety (4%), been impacted economically (4%), have had depressive or suicidal thoughts (2%), contacted law enforcement (2%) or contacted an attorney (1%).

Methodology

The survey was conducted by YouGov, a leading public opinion and data analytics firm, on behalf of ADL, examining Jewish AmericansÃ¢Â€Â™ experiences with antisemitism (both online and in the physical world). The survey of Jewish American adults over the age of 18 was conducted from January 17Ã¢Â€Â“30, 2020. A total of 538 responses were collected from Jewish Americans, 18 and older, and weighted to reflect the demographic makeup of Jewish people across the United States, according to Pew Research Center. Participants are rewarded for general participation in YouGov surveys but were not directly rewarded by ADL for their participation in this survey. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of respondents is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.

Footnotes:
1 We report on incidents that are attributed to antisemitism by the respondents.
2 Reported results are Jewish respondents indicating that they experienced harassment as a result of their religion.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe welcome Columbia UniversityÃ¢Â€Â™s announcement that it is taking significant action to curb antisemitism on its campus. Over the past 18 months, Columbia inadequately addressed the crisis of antisemitism on its campus following the 10/7 terror attacks on Israel. In both 2024 and 2025, the university received a Ã¢Â€ÂœDÃ¢Â€Â grade on ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Campus Antisemitism Report Card, indicating severe levels of antisemitic conduct, including harassment, defacement, building occupation, class disruption, threats, intimidation and law breaking on campus and an alarming campus climate and a culture of impunity.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThese antisemitic actions, breaches of conduct codes and law, went insufficiently addressed for almost a year and half, all well outside any bounds of free speech. For more than 500 days, ADL has advocated for many of the changes that Columbia announced this past Friday, including, but not limited to:

Rigorous and consistent enforcement of disciplinary rules, non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies;
Updated security protocols and enforcement of time, place, and manner restrictions pertaining to protests and demonstrations;
A policy that restricts masked harassment and intimidation and prohibits the use of face coverings for the purpose of concealing oneÃ¢Â€Â™s identity;
Oversight of student groups who are violating campus policies.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe effectiveness of these changes will depend entirely on their implementation and enforcement. Columbia must be held accountable for putting these commitments into action. Such practices must protect free speech and academic freedom but not extend to rule breaking actions.

Ã¢Â€ÂœItÃ¢Â€Â™s imperative that any new policies respect the civil rights of all students. This must start with the Jewish students whose civil rights have diminished dramatically since Oct. 7.

Ã‚Â 

Can we use games to help people better connect with themselves and with others? Can we use game design to support perspective-taking, compassion, and care?

It may be surprising to hear that gamesÃ¢Â€Â”of all thingsÃ¢Â€Â”can help support connection and compassion.

Particularly when we often hear quite the opposite. Games have become well-known as communities where toxic behavior, such as bullying, harassment and hate occur. Just like other online social platforms, such as Twitter or Facebook, online environments such as Twitch (an online platform where players livestream games), and Fortnite, Overwatch, Apex Legends, and other competitive games have been sites of bullying, harassment, racism, and antisemitism. The ADL found that 47% of daily Twitch users have experienced harassment, as well as 36% of frequent Discord users (an online communication platform frequently used by game players). This compares with 37% of daily users of Facebook.

Moreover, as in the case of all media, whether books, film, or television, the content of games may also be problematicÃ¢Â€Â”such as having racist, sexist, and prejudiced representations of characters and storylines. And, sometimes how a game is used is problematic. Recent games have stirred controversy, such as the Rape Day game, which involves players raping virtual women during a zombie apocalypse (and ended up not being released on Steam after an extended controversy).ii Likewise, players of RockstarÃ¢Â€Â™s Red Dead Redemption II shared videos of themselves killing of virtual characters supporting womenÃ¢Â€Â™s right to vote in the game. Many game-related communities have been rife with harassment, and even violence, such as the GamerGate community, as well as communities within games, such as in some social virtual reality (VR) environments.

On the other hand, games and gaming have also been seen as aspirational and innovative. Recent reports lauded game players as Ã¢Â€Âœmore likely to get a jobÃ¢Â€Â and have marketable skills. v Top trends such as gamification (applying game-like features to non-game contexts) speak to a desire for even nongame designers to draw on the benefits of games and incorporate them in healthcare, education, and corporate environments (with varying levels of success). Games are also increasingly being used in the classroom and for learning purposes, with 74% of K-8 teachers using games and 55% of teachers using them at least once per week.vi And, games are extremely popular and a $135 billion industry.

However, games and game communities are not all bad or all goodÃ¢Â€Â”they are much more nuanced than that. Just like all communities, they can support cruelty and toxicity, as well as compassion and care. We have found that some games, under certain conditions, can provide insight into humanity, including different identities, perspectives, emotions, and ways of solving problems. They can enable players to experiment with their own or otherÃ¢Â€Â™s identities, they can enable empathetic interactions with other players, and they can immerse players in new worlds, systems, and mindsets. Games can serve as a way of opening conversations with young people about what matters to them and why.

For instance, some games express personal narratives or let you play as the role of another and perform their story. That Dragon Cancer gives you a glimpse of what it is like experiencing a familyÃ¢Â€Â™s grief over their young sonÃ¢Â€Â™s cancer. A mobile game, Liyla and the Shadows of War, shows what it is like for a family living in the Gaza strip and dealing with war and violence. The analog roleplaying game, Rosenstrasse, lets players make ethical decisions and relive a moment in history (which involved non-Jewish women protesting the imprisonment of their Jewish partners in Berlin under the Reich). When Rivers Were Trails explores the impact of U.S. policies on indigenous communities, while also sharing stories of the Anishinaabe people.

Perhaps better questions, then, are not whether games are universally bad or good, but under what types of conditions, and with what types of designs, can we use games (or the process of creating a game) to encourage perspective-taking, support prosocial behaviors, and even reduce hate and bias? This type of research is new, innovative, and only just beginning to emerge. In this paper, we begin to grapple with these questions, and we encourage even more research to be conducted in this exciting field.

In this report, we will review:

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/white-supremacists-step-campus-propaganda-efforts-2018,"Under intensified public scrutiny, white supremacists are facing a Catch-22: As individuals, they want to remain anonymous and invisible, but they need to promote their organizations and ideology. Their solution: Increased propaganda efforts, which allow them to maximize media and online attention, while limiting the risk of individual exposure, negative media coverage, arrests and public backlash.

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Center on Extremism (COE) continues to track an ever-growing number of white supremacist propaganda efforts, including the distribution of racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic fliers, stickers, banners and posters. The 2018 data shows a 182% increase of incidents from the previous year, with 1,187 cases reported, compared to 421 in 2017.

The propaganda, which includes everything from veiled white supremacist language to explicitly racist images and words, often features a recruitment element, and frequently targets minority groups, including Jews, Blacks, Muslims, non-white immigrants and the LGBTQ community.

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s H.E.A.T. Map provides a visual representation of the propaganda distribution efforts and helps highlight specific trends Ã¢Â€Â“ showing, for example, that the 2018 propaganda incidents are predominantly concentrated in large metropolitan areas, with the highest activity levels in the states of California, Texas, Colorado, New York, Illinois, Florida and Virginia.

The 2018 numbers, which far exceed any previous annual propaganda distribution counts, also demonstrate that while white supremacist groups continued to target U.S. college campuses, the number of on-campus incidents increased only modestly (9%), compared to a huge (572%) jump in off-campus incidents.






In 2018, the ADL recorded 319 incidents of white supremacist propaganda on 212 college and university campuses in 37 states and the District of Columbia. The two most active alt right groups, Identity Evropa and Patriot Front, are responsible for the bulk of the campus incidents.

Identity Evropa adherents are responsible for 191 such incidents, while members of Patriot Front contributed another 51. Andrew Anglin supporters known as the Daily Stormer Book Clubs (DSBC) targeted campuses with 29 fliering incidents. Neo-Nazi groups such as Vanguard America and the National Socialist Legion, as well as the now-defunct Traditionalist Worker Party, also participated in a few incidents.

While 2018 campus propaganda incidents modestly beat 2017Ã¢Â€Â™s count, the number of off-campus propaganda distributions skyrocketed from 129 in 2017 to 868 in 2018. Off-campus propaganda distribution is a tactic long favored by neo-Nazis, Klan groups and other white supremacists, but in 2018, alt right groups were responsible for most of these efforts. Patriot Front led the way with 324 distributions, while 312 incidents were linked to Identity Evropa. Daily Stormer followers were responsible for 34.

Even the declining Klan movement noticeably increased their propaganda efforts in 2018. In the past year, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s COE counted 97 incidents in which Klan fliers were left on doorsteps or driveways in neighborhoods around the country, a 20% increase from their preceding four-year average of 77 annual incidents. Though eleven different Klan groups took part in this activity, the majority (78) of the 97 incidents were attributed to the North Carolina-based Loyal White Knights (LWK), a Nazified Klan group best known for their vitriolic and often anti-Semitic propaganda. Though the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s fliers do occasionally appear in more far-flung states, the LWK is best categorized as a regional Klan. In 2018, an overwhelming majority of its fliering incidents targeted the mid-Atlantic region, with most of the incidents concentrated in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

Neo-Nazi groups such as Atomwaffen Division, National Alliance, National Socialist Legion, National Socialist Movement and Vanguard America were responsible for approximately 5% of off-campus flier distributions.

Additional Propaganda Tactics

The alt right continues to use banners to promote their message. In 2018, the COE counted 32 instances of white supremacists hanging banners in highly visible locations like highway overpasses, a count significantly lower than the unprecedented proliferation of banner use the COE identified between May 2017 to March 2018. During this 10-month time span, white supremacists used banners an average of seven times per month.

Texas-based Patriot Front, the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s second-largest alt right group, used banners the most in 2018, deploying banners 21 times, while Identity Evropa used banners nine times. Most of the banners delivered an anti-immigration message. One notable exception: A banner, attributed to a Virginia-based Daily Stormer Book Club, draped over a church sign in Arrington, Virginia, declaring, Ã¢Â€ÂœJames Fields did nothing wrong.Ã¢Â€Â Fields was convicted of murdering Heather Heyer when he drove his car into a group of counter-protesters at the Ã¢Â€ÂœUnite the RightÃ¢Â€Â rally in 2017.

These groups have also placed their propaganda in books at libraries, bookstores and community book exchange boxes. They often choose books related to their ideology; at the Gloversville, New York, public library, a Loyal White Knights recruitment flier was discovered inside a book about slavery.

Identity Evropa

Identity Evropa, the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s largest alt right group, was responsible for nearly half (503 of 1187) of the propaganda distributions in 2018. The group refrains from using recognizable white supremacist imagery and language, preferring subtler white supremacist messages. Their latest fliers, featuring George Washington or Andrew Jackson, read, Ã¢Â€ÂœEuropean roots American greatness.""

Some of the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s 2018 propaganda targeted public figures.Ã‚Â  Since September, the group has distributed fliers accusing New York Governor Andrew Cuomo of stifling free speech. In Atlanta, they posted similarly styled fliers accusing Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms of Ã¢Â€Âœputting illegal aliens first.Ã¢Â€Â As part of their ongoing efforts to appear as conventional conservatives they also used propaganda with mainstream messages like Ã¢Â€ÂœMerry ChristmasÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœThank you veterans.Ã¢Â€Â

Patriot Front

Over the course of the year, Patriot Front was responsible for approximately one third (375 of 1187) of propaganda distributions. Patriot Front followed Identity EvropaÃ¢Â€Â™s lead and attempted to normalize or mainstream their public presence. In April 2018, the group discontinued their use of anti-Semitic propaganda. By October, theyÃ¢Â€Â™d launched new propaganda featuring a web address using the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s name in place of their previous (right-wing nationalist) slogan, Ã¢Â€Âœblood and soil.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â  In spite of these changes, members have continued to chant Ã¢Â€Âœblood and soilÃ¢Â€Â during demonstrations, and to use their propaganda to target Jews and other perceived enemies.

In 2018, Patriot Front propaganda was found at multiple synagogues, an African American church in Florida, an LGBTQ community center in Washington, an Immigration and Human rights Law Firm in Virginia and on a sign promoting a Ramadan event. The group also posted stickers reading, Ã¢Â€ÂœFAKE NEWS DONÃ¢Â€Â™T BUY IT!Ã¢Â€Â at news media offices and on newspaper dispensers. After writing articles about Patriot Front, a number of journalists, their families, and other activists and researchers received Patriot Front cards (mailed to their home addresses) that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœPATRIOTISM WITH TEETH.""

Daily Stormer Book Clubs

While they generated far fewer propaganda incidents (63 of 1187) in 2018, the Daily Stormer Book Clubs (SBC) did hold several coordinated anti-Semitic fliering campaigns throughout the year. On the weekend of March 21, 2018, they organized Ã¢Â€ÂœOperation Gun Grabbing KikesÃ¢Â€Â a fliering campaign that targeted college campuses and sporting goods stores in more than ten states. In August, an SBC fliering campaign blamed Jews for censoring free speech after right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was de-platformed from multiple social media sites. These fliers were found at churches, on college campuses and at Jewish institutions in multiple states. This was followed by a spate of fliers in October blaming Jews for the allegations of misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. An October 7 post to the Daily Stormer website claimed, Ã¢Â€Âœthe anti-Kavanaugh movement was almost entirely Jewish in nature.Ã¢Â€Â






White Supremacist Groups Rethink Pre-Announced Rallies

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s H.E.A.T. Map provides a visual representation of the 91 white supremacist events tracked by the Center on Extremism in 2018 and highlights a number of trends Ã¢Â€Â“ most notably, that white supremacist groups moved away from pre-announcing events to the public.

A review of 2018Ã¢Â€Â™s events reveals a white supremacist movement focused on tactics designed to circumvent intensified public scrutiny. This meant fewer pre-announced events and more unannounced flash demonstrations, allowing them to promote their own narratives while limiting the risk of individual exposure, negative media coverage, arrests and public backlash.

In 2018, there were very few pre-announced white supremacist events, and those that did occur suffered from low attendance and faced heavy opposition. The tone was set early in the year when Michigan State University rejected alt right leader Richard SpencerÃ¢Â€Â™s plans to speak there, relenting only after SpencerÃ¢Â€Â™s attorney, fellow white supremacist Kyle Bristow, filed a First Amendment lawsuit against the school.

Even then, the university attempted to minimize SpencerÃ¢Â€Â™s impact by agreeing to an event date during the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s spring break and by holding the event at their somewhat isolated Pavilion for Agriculture and Livestock Education.Ã‚Â  SpencerÃ¢Â€Â™s March 5th event was poorly attended, due in part to the efforts of antifa activists who physically prevented a number of SpencerÃ¢Â€Â™s supporters from reaching the Pavilion. That weekend, East Lansing also saw the collapse of an alt right conference organized by Bristow and his Foundation of Marketplace of Ideas, after several local businesses withdrew as event venues upon learning about BristowÃ¢Â€Â™s group. The eventÃ¢Â€Â™s fate was sealed when Bristow abruptly resigned from his position as executive director of the Foundation for Marketplace of Ideas and announced he would not be attending SpencerÃ¢Â€Â™s event. After the Michigan State fiasco, Spencer, with a nod to antifa, decided to cancel his college speaking tour, and said he would try to find other ways to reach the public.

Richard Spencer wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t the only alt right personality whose events fared poorly in 2018:Ã‚Â  While it was the yearÃ¢Â€Â™s second largest public event, Jason KesslerÃ¢Â€Â™s Unite the Right 2 gathering failed to draw significant support from the alt right. The heavily protested event drew a motley group of about 30 right-wing speakers and activists.

Fewer pre-announced events, fewer attendees

2018Ã¢Â€Â™s largest pre-announced public white supremacist event took place in April, when approximately 40 white supremacists gathered in Newnan, Georgia, for a rally organized by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement (NSM). The annual rally, which coincides with HitlerÃ¢Â€Â™s birthday, was much smaller than the previous yearÃ¢Â€Â™s event, when approximately 125 white supremacists rallied in Pikeville, Kentucky. Overall, 2018 was a challenging year for NSM and their Nationalist Front allies. In April, the Traditionalist Worker Party dissolved into chaos after co-founder and leader Matthew Heimbach was arrested for domestic battery, and in August, the League of the South (LoS) abruptly announced they would no longer partner with the Nationalist Front. As a result, the NSMÃ¢Â€Â™s fall rally in Little Rock, Arkansas, drew just 20 people. This was a dismal turnout compared to the 200 or so participants who showed up for the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s fall 2017 rally in Shelbyville, Tennessee.

The League of the South, a white supremacist group that advocates for southern succession, pulled off the third largest pre-announced public event in 2018; in January, approximately 28 of their members and supporters participated in a rally at FloridaÃ¢Â€Â™s Old Capitol building in Tallahassee. A very heavy law enforcement presence maintained a barrier between the LoS and counter protesters Ã¢Â€Â“ who outnumbered the white supremacists six to one.

Nine months later, the LoS attempted to hold a pre-announced rally at Sycamore Shoals State Park in northeastern Tennessee. In late August, the group began openly promoting their plan to rally against the Ã¢Â€Âœdestruction of Confederate monuments.Ã¢Â€Â However, just days before the scheduled September 29 rally, LoS leader Michael Hill canceled the event, saying he had received word from Tennessee authorities that the group would have to purchase insurance for the event and cover the cost of security at the park.

The Ã¢Â€Âœflash demonstrationÃ¢Â€Â option

In lieu of the cancelled rally, LoS privately planned an unannounced flash demonstration more than 60 miles away in Newport, Tennessee. Despite the secrecy, the event faced its own obstacles. When approximately 30 individuals associated with the LoS and the Shield Wall Network assembled in front of the Cocke County courthouse, local authorities advised them they were in violation of a city ordinance and asked them to leave. Later, a post appeared on the LeagueÃ¢Â€Â™s website describing a successful event that lasted more than two and a half hours.

LoS leader Hill similarly manipulated the narrative after the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s June flash demonstration held at 6:00 a.m. on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. He wrote on the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s website that two dozen LoS members had Ã¢Â€ÂœoccupiedÃ¢Â€Â the iconic civil rights memorial where in 1965 black voting rights activists were brutally attacked by law enforcement. Noting the value of Ã¢Â€Âœphotographic propaganda,Ã¢Â€Â Hill included an image of the group assembled on the bridge.






Flash demonstrations Ã¢Â€Â“ unannounced, quickly disbanded gatherings -- proved a viable alternative to pre-announced events, especially for the two most active alt right groups, Identity Evropa and Patriot Front, which were responsible for more than 30 flash demonstrations.

While two-thirds of these events were quite small, with fewer than ten participants, these two groups were also responsible for 2018Ã¢Â€Â™s two largest white supremacist flash demonstrations.

In March, while in Tennessee for their first national conference (a private event), approximately 50 members of Identity Evropa took part in a flash demonstration at the Parthenon in NashvilleÃ¢Â€Â™s Centennial Park. And in December, approximately 50 Patriot Front members, led by Thomas Rousseau, held a flash demonstration in Washington D.C. During a January 2019 podcast hosted by Richard Spencer, Rousseau said that his groupÃ¢Â€Â™s D.C. demonstration was evidence that Patriot Front can Ã¢Â€Âœcreate solutionsÃ¢Â€Â and find ways to spread their message Ã¢Â€ÂœunhinderedÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœcompletely unmolested by any antifa.Ã¢Â€Â






Most of the alt rightÃ¢Â€Â™s 2018 flash demonstrations focused on immigration issues; attendees protested sanctuary cities and held demonstrations at the Mexican-American border and at Mexican consulates. Patriot Front also targeted left-wing events, disrupting an anarchist bookfair at Boston University and a Ã¢Â€ÂœBingo against bordersÃ¢Â€Â event at a Houston bar, and sabotaging an Ã¢Â€ÂœOccupy ICEÃ¢Â€Â event in San Antonio.

Small, collaborative groups of white supremacists focused on staging small counter-demonstrations in and around Arkansas and Tennessee. These assemblies often included members of the Traditionalist Worker Party, Shield Wall Network, League of the South, National Socialist Movement and the Knights Party, an Arkansas-based Klan group. Over the course of 2018, they protested womenÃ¢Â€Â™s marches, gay pride events, a rally by the Satanic Temple, an anti-gun Ã¢Â€ÂœMarch For Our Lives,Ã¢Â€Â and a group that opposed Brett KavanaughÃ¢Â€Â™s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Private events draw larger crowds

Unsurprisingly, private white supremacist events are currently the movementÃ¢Â€Â™s best-attended gatherings. Hammerfest, an annual hate rock concert and racist skinhead convention, was by far the largest white supremacist event of 2018. The gathering, hosted by the West Coast chapter of the Hammerskin Nation, was also a celebration of the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s 30th anniversary, and brought more than 150 attendees to San Diego, California.

Private conferences held in 2018 by suit-and-tie white supremacists were also well attended. Groups such as Identity Evropa, American Renaissance, American Freedom Party, and the Council of Conservative Citizens typically drew between 50 and 100 individuals to their conferences. These events were all held at the Montgomery Bell State Park in Burns, Tennessee, a location that has become a favorite as white supremacists are forced out of private venues.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/white-supremacist-propaganda-nearly-doubles-campus-2017-18-academic-year,"ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Center on Extremism continues to track a growing number of white supremacist propaganda efforts targeting college campuses, including the distribution of racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic fliers, stickers, banners and posters. The 2017-18 data shows a 77 percent increase of incidents from the previous academic year, with 292 cases reported, compared to 165 in 2016-2017.

White supremacists have been actively targeting U.S. college campuses since January 2016, but the practice failed to gain any real traction until the fall semester of that year. Since then, propaganda efforts have steadily increased.

Since September 1, 2016, ADL has recorded 478 incidents of white supremacist propaganda appearing on college and university campuses.Ã‚Â These campaigns have targeted 287 college campuses in 47 states and the District of Columbia.

This continues to be a favorite tactic among groups within the alt right segment of the white supremacist movement. Identity Evropa was responsible for nearly half (230 of 478) of the incidents while Patriot Front (which formed only nine months ago) is responsible for 70 incidents. Andrew AnglinÃ¢Â€Â™s Daily Stormer Book Clubs have targeted campuses, albeit to a much lesser degree (16 incidents). Tiny, localized alt right groups have also targeted campuses -- including Louisiana-based Identity Acadia, West Virginia-based Patriots of Appalachia, New YorkÃ¢Â€Â™s White Rochester, IdahoÃ¢Â€Â™s Boise State Nationalists and New JerseyÃ¢Â€Â™s European Heritage Association.

Several National Socialist groups have targeted college campuses, as well.Ã‚Â  This includes groups such as the now-defunct Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP), Vanguard America (VA), and the National Socialist Legion (NSL), a new group founded by former members of VA.

TWP, VA and NSL have posted these fliers on campuses this year

The propaganda, which ranges from veiled white supremacist language to explicitly racist images and words, often includes a recruitment element, and frequently attacks minority groups including Jews, Blacks, Muslims, non-white immigrants and the LGBT community.

Some of the most recent campus propaganda has focused on the baseless perception of the dangers posed by a caravan of undocumented immigrants traveling toward the Mexican-American border. Identity EvropaÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€ÂœStop the CaravanÃ¢Â€Â fliers urged students to call the White House and demand the Trump administration take action to stop the caravan, while a Patriot Front flier implored students to Ã¢Â€ÂœKeep America AmericanÃ¢Â€Â and to report Ã¢Â€Âœillegal aliensÃ¢Â€Â to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In addition to widely targeting Jewish learning institutions, white supremacists have also targeted minority-related venues and buildings with propaganda. In January 2018, Identity Evropa fliers were posted on the Ethnic Studies Department bulletin board at Santa Clara University in California, and racist fliers were found plastered over photos of black historical figures outside the department of African-American studies at the University of South Carolina at Columbia. In February, fliers referencing Hitler were placed over posters promoting Black History Month at the University of Tenneessee, and a Patriot Front flier that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœNot here not everÃ¢Â€Â was posted over a sign promoting a learning series on the issue of Ã¢Â€ÂœcivilityÃ¢Â€Â at Weber State University in Utah.

Near Term Outlook

As was the case during the summer of 2017, the rate of campus fliering is likely to wane during the upcoming summer months. When so many students are away for the summer break, white supremacist groups have found off-campus propaganda distribution to be more appealing and productive. Popular off-campus locations include residential driveways and pedestrian-heavy urban areas.

In fact, off-campus fliering (by many of the same groups that target campuses) has accelerated since January 2018. The ADL has counted 185 off-campus propaganda distributions since January 2018 -- averaging more than one incident per day for the first 5 months of the year.

Off-campus propaganda distribution is a tactic long favored by neo-Nazis and other white supremacists, but in recent years itÃ¢Â€Â™s been most consistently used by the Klan movement. Between 2014 and 2017, there were an average of 80 Klan fliering incidents each year.

Recent Examples of Non-Propaganda White Supremacist Activity on Campus

University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, April 2018: Ã¢Â€ÂœUnite the RightÃ¢Â€Â organizer Jason Kessler was issued a no-trespass warning for the University of Virginia campus after allegedly threatening students on campus and harassing them online.

Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas, April 2018: After eight people posted white supremacist fliers on campus, they were cited with criminal trespass charges. According to police, the individuals were not students and admitted being affiliated with white supremacist organizations.

Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, March 2018:Richard Spencer spoke at an event attended by several dozen of his fellow white supremacists. Violence erupted as white supremacists and counter-protesters clashed outside the event. Approximately two dozen counter-protesters were arrested, mostly on charges related to resisting and obstructing police. After the lackluster event, Spencer shelved his planned college speaking tour and said the protesters that have confronted him at such events, sometimes using violent tactics, were Ã¢Â€Âœwinning.Ã¢Â€Â

University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, February 2018: Matthew Heimbach spoke in a privately rented hall to an audience of approximately 45 people that included members of HeimbachÃ¢Â€Â™s now-defunct Traditionalist Worker Party, members of the League of the South, and several members of Vanguard America. The event was both the first and the last of HeimbachÃ¢Â€Â™s (recently cancelled) Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Socialism or DeathÃ¢Â€Â college lecture series.

Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, February 2018: Approximately six white supremacists appeared on the Colorado State University campus during a Turning Point USA speaking event featuring Charlie Kirk. The 6 men shouted Ã¢Â€Âœwhite powerÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœblood and soilÃ¢Â€Â and skirmished with counter-protesters. No arrests were made.

University of North Florida (UNF), Jacksonville, Florida, November 2017: Several members of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement rallied outside the UniversityÃ¢Â€Â™s Alumni Center on behalf of Ken Parker, a UNF student and former Klansman and neo-Nazi. Parker was suspended from the school after making controversial social media posts.

University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, October 2017: Richard Spencer spoke at an event attended by several dozen of his fellow white supremacists, including members of Patriot Front, who controlled the ticket distribution and security.Ã‚Â  After the event, three attendees allegedly yelled, Ã¢Â€ÂœHeil Hitler,Ã¢Â€Â while driving by a group standing near a bus stop, leading to an altercation in which one of three reportedly fired a gun. Texans Tyler Tenbrink and Colton Fears are facing charges related to the incident. Charges against the third man have been dropped.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/gaza-march-return-what-you-need-know,"On Friday, March 30,Ã‚Â HamasÃ‚Â launched its six-week-long Ã¢Â€ÂœMarch of ReturnÃ¢Â€Â campaign, which called on Gazans to gather near the border with Israel and to march on the border. Organizers claim the march is intended to highlight the plight of Gaza, the broader Palestinian situation, and theÃ‚Â Right of ReturnÃ‚Â for Palestinian refugees.

The largest and deadliest confrontation took place on May 14, the day of theÃ‚Â US Embassy dedicationÃ‚Â in Jerusalem.Ã‚Â  An estimated 50,000 Palestinians protested on the Gaza border and by the end of the day at least 60 Gazans were dead and thousands wounded.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Some engaged in violent activities, including attempted infiltrations into Israel and the use of various weapons against IDF soldiers and outposts. IDF soldiers responded with riot dispersing methods, and, in some cases, live fire.

Following the tensions along the border in Mid-May, Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired scores of mortars and rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.Ã‚Â  On May 28, over a hundred such weapons were fired into Israel.Ã‚Â  One hit a kindergarten in the early morning hours.Ã‚Â  Another damaged a power line which provides electricity to Gaza.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  On May 30 both Hamas and Israel acknowledged an informal ceasefire had been reached.

Friday Demonstrations:Ã‚Â 

On the first day of demonstrations,Ã‚Â on Friday, March 30, an estimated 30,000 Gazans joined the March. While there were many who protested peacefully, there were large groups of protestors who approached the border fence intending to damage or break through the demarcation line.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â These violent groups came to the protest with Molotov cocktails, explosives and burning tires, and some carried guns.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reacted to this activity close to the border, utilizing tear gas, rubber bullets and live fire, killing sixteen and injuring between 700-1000, primarily by tear gas and other riot dispersing weapons.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The IDF says that of those killed, at least 11 were identified (some by the IDF, some by Hamas and Islamic Jihad themselves) as active members of Hamas and other terrorist groups and they assert that the IDF fired only on those who were attempting to take action against the border fence or Israeli soldiers.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

The subsequent demonstrations through April drew smaller crowds, and organizers called in advance of the various weekly events for the burning of tires, flags, a Ã¢Â€ÂœwomenÃ¢Â€Â™s marchÃ¢Â€Â and other acts.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  At some demonstrations, protestors sent flaming kites into the air with the intent of flying into Israel and setting land aflame.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  At each event scores of protesters attempted to reach the border fence, some throwing explosives and rocks.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  As in the first demonstration, the IDF responded including with live fire, and by early May the total number of Palestinians killed reached 45, with thousands injured.

Israeli officials have asserted throughout this crisis that the IDFÃ¢Â€Â™s actions are defensive in nature, and are being taken to protect Israeli communities on the other side of the barrier from those seeking to breach it.Ã‚Â 

Hamas leaders have pledged to continue these demonstrations through the month of Ramadan.Ã‚Â 

The May 14 Protest:

The week of May 13 had long been expected to be a tense period for Israelis and Palestinians along with the wider region given a confluence of anniversaries and events.Ã‚Â  These include the May 14 opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem , the 70th anniversary of the Palestinian commemoration of what they call Ã¢Â€Âœthe NakbaÃ¢Â€Â (meaning Ã¢Â€ÂœcatastropheÃ¢Â€Â) of IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s creationÃ‚Â  on May 15, and the start of Ramadan.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

On Monday, May 14, these anniversaries and events came together with a celebration in Jerusalem for the Embassy opening, but also with violence and significant casualties in Gaza.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Televised news featured a Ã¢Â€Âœsplit screenÃ¢Â€Â with the embassy festivities on one side, and, discordantly, the chaotic scenes from Gaza on the other side.Ã‚Â 

Hamas heavily mobilized the Gaza population, shutting down schools and workplaces and bussing people to the demonstration points.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar had urged demonstrators in recent weeks to Ã¢Â€Âœtear down the wall and tear out their [IsraeliÃ¢Â€Â™s] hearts.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Sever days before May 14, he suggested that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians could breach IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s security barrier.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

In anticipation of the demonstrations, Israel had warned Gazans via social media and in leaflets dropped by drones, that efforts to breach the border would be dealt with immediately, and that demonstrators should not attempt to march on the barrier.Ã‚Â  This same message was relayed throughout the day on May 14 via loudspeaker.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

As in past demonstrations, some protestors did so in a non-violent manner, while others were armed with weapons or explosives with the intent of storming the border fence and inflicting harm to Israelis.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  According to the IDF, Hamas squads Ã¢Â€Â“ situated in 2 different locations Ã¢Â€Â“ were discovered attempting to place explosive charges on the fence to enable mass infiltration into Israel.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  In addition, throughout the day at least ten explosive devices were thrown or planted along the border area, and 25 kitesÃ‚Â carrying firebombs were sent over the fence, causing 23 fires on Israeli farmland.

There are reports that even as some Palestinians approaching the border were killed and injured, Hamas loudspeakers at a gathering point for the protests were misleadingly encouraging demonstrators to burst through the fence, claiming falsely that Israeli soldiers had abandoned their positions.

A senior Hamas official has since claimed that of at least 60 people killed at the border,Ã‚Â 50 were members of Hamas, calling it Ã¢Â€Âœan official figureÃ¢Â€Â.Ã‚Â  Hamas had previously acknowledged that 10 of the 60 fatalities on May 14 were members of its internal ministry security forces.Ã‚Â  Another terrorist group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, has claimed three of the fatalities that day as members of its armed wing, including a minor.

The significant number of casualties raised questions regarding the IDFÃ¢Â€Â™s use of force, and specifically its use of live fire.Ã‚Â  The IDF said that the expressed intent to breach the border threatened Israeli civilians and communities in southern Israel (with fears of potentially thousands of Gazans crossing the barrier, some threatening to commit violence against Israelis,Ã‚Â  kidnap Israelis and Israeli soldiers). The IDF maintains that it responded in the only way it could to what it called rioters approaching the barrier.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  According to the IDF, its usual methods of crowd dispersal Ã¢Â€Â“ tear gas and rubber bullets Ã¢Â€Â“were not effective in this situation, and they maintain they only used live fire when there were direct efforts to breach the fence, or when protestors were threatening the barrier and IDF soldiers with explosives and weapons.Ã‚Â  There have been some reports and video clips of Gazans being shot while not visibly engaged in efforts to breach the fence or violence towards Israel.

International Reaction:

The IDFÃ¢Â€Â™s use of force and use of live ammunition has engendered criticism by the UN, EU and other international leaders, as well as human rights groups since the first protest on March30.Ã‚Â  There has also been condemnation of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ using civilians and children as a cover for the violent actions of their operatives.Ã‚Â  The significant death toll and injury on May 14 led to numerous diplomatic expressions of condemnation of Israel and calls for investigations into Ã¢Â€Âœexcessive use of forceÃ¢Â€Â and lack of Ã¢Â€Âœproportionality.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Turkey and South Africa recalled their ambassadors to Israel.Ã‚Â  In a series of public statements, Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan harshly criticized Israel and compared it to Nazi Germany.Ã‚Â  At a discussion on the violence at the United Nations Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley pushed back on the criticism of Israel, saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has. In fact, the records of several countries here today suggest they would be much less restrained.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  On May 18, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution Ã‚Â condemning Ã¢Â€Âœthe disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian civiliansÃ¢Â€Â and establishing an investigation into the events.Ã‚Â  The resolution did not condemn Hamas nor address the use of violence to attack the border as part of the demonstrations.Ã‚Â 

What is HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ goal with the March of Return?

Through the mobilization of the March of Return, Hamas is apparently aiming to affirm its relevancy as the leader of the Palestinians and to divert attention from the deep dissatisfaction among the people of Gaza with HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ management of the Gaza Strip.Ã‚Â 

According to analysts, the march has two distinct strategies.Ã‚Â  The first, through the outwardly peaceful, civilian elements of the demonstration, is to raise international awareness of the plight of Gazans and Palestinians.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The second, through the militants who are attempting to approach and attack the border line, is to use the demonstrators as human shields for the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s terrorist ambitions, as well as to provoke a strong Israeli response that will garner headlines and support for their efforts.Ã‚Â 

The people of Gaza, who since 2007 have been governed by Hamas, have long suffered from poverty, lack of social services, and the breakdown of infrastructure supplying electricity, water and managing sewage.Ã‚Â  This situation has grown worse with the combination of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ social and religious repression and mismanagement, IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s security blockade, the effective blockade by Egypt, and recent moves by the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority which, in an intensification of its rivalry with Hamas, has limited the flow of funds and payments to Gaza.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

HamasÃ‚Â has been designated by both the United States and the European Union as a terrorist organization.Ã‚Â  Hamas calls for the eradication of the State of Israel and is avowedly opposed to peace negotiations.Ã‚Â 

Hamas has a long record of diverting attention from domestic problems to the conflict with Israel.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  This was a driving force of the Israel-Hamas conflicts in 2008, 2012 and 2014.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ usual mode of attack Ã¢Â€Â“ rocket fire and infiltration into Israel through tunnels Ã¢Â€Â“ has been stymied by Israeli defensive measures.Ã‚Â

As of JuneÃ‚Â 2017, the organized Ku Klux Klan movement in the United States consists of just over 40 active Klan groups, a slight increase from early 2016. More than half of the current Klans have formed in the last three years Ã¢Â€Â” a powerful illustration of just how short-lived Klan groups continue to be.

Current Trends

The organized Ku Klux Klan movement continues to struggle due to several factors, including infighting, the perception among adherents that current Klan groups (or their leaders) are not authentic, as well as competition for membership from other white supremacist movements. These include the surging Ã¢Â€ÂœAlternative rightÃ¢Â€Â and a rising number of white supremacist prison gangs.

One of the clearest signs of the declining state of Ku Klux Klan groups is their inability to demonstrate stability or continuity. More than half of the currently active Klan groups were formed or re-started in the last threeÃ‚Â years. Many of these newly formed Klan groups, led by self-appointed Imperial Wizards (the title for a Klan leader), garner little support from associates or potential members. One Pennsylvania Klansman recently lamented on social media that there were more Imperial Wizards on Facebook than at Hogwarts Academy.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is no disrespect to any true IWÃ¢Â€Â™s, but there is more Imperial Wizards on Facebook then there is at Hogwarts academy.Ã¢Â€Â 2017 Facebook post by Ã¢Â€ÂœJoe MulliganÃ¢Â€Â

Infighting, stimulated by an active rumor mill, also plays a major role in the collective decline of the Ku Klux Klan. The implications of this trend have not been lost on individual Klansmen. The Facebook introduction for Jason OÃ¢Â€Â™Hara, former leader of the Alabama-based American Christian Dixie Knights, admits that Ã¢Â€ÂœWith the slander, backstabbing and infighting, we have become our own worst enemy.Ã¢Â€Â A Maine-based Klansman wrote in April 2017, Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â¦these new pop [up] groups and infighting within our ranks hurt our Great Fraternal Organization. If they want to Fight, [they should] Fight for our Race and Children.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWith the slander, backstabbing and infighting, we have become our own worst enemy.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœJason OÃ¢Â€Â™HaraÃ¢Â€Â 2017 Facebook Intro

Rumors routinely surface about one Klan leader, then another, causing alliances and groups to lose members and splinter. For example, in January 2017 Bradley JenkinsÃ¢Â€Â™ Alabama-based United Klans of America (UKA) was banished from the Sadistic SoulÃ¢Â€Â™s Black & Silver Alliance following accusations that Jenkins was acting as an informant. After the rumors surfaced and the alliance was broken, several UKA members left and helped formÃ‚Â a new group, the Global Crusader Knights. In the same vein, Texas Rebel Knights leader Lonnie Ã¢Â€ÂœRowdyÃ¢Â€Â Coats lost members and supporters in December 2016 after someone uncovered and circulated evidence of his 1972 rape conviction. Some of his former members went on to form the Oklahoma-based Teutonic Knights.

In other cases, Klan infighting has gone beyond rumor and innuendo and turned violent, ranging from aggravated assault to murder. In early February 2017, Klanswoman Malissa Ancona was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence and abandonment of a corpse in the murder of her Klan-leader husband, Frank Ancona. The two married in 2010 during a gathering of their Klan group, the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

In December 2016, two leaders of the Loyal White Knights (LWK),Ã‚Â Imperial Wizard Christopher Eugene Barker and California Grand Dragon William Ernest Hagen, were arrested on charges related to the alleged felony assault of another man during a gathering at BarkerÃ¢Â€Â™s home in Yanceyville, North Carolina. The brawl further damaged BarkerÃ¢Â€Â™s reputation as a leader, after unconfirmed rumors emerged that he acted as an FBI informant against another Klansman, Glendon Scott Crawford. In December 2016, Crawford was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for planning to use a radiation dispersal device to kill Muslims and Barack Obama.

Nationwide, there are still approximately 3,000 Klan members and unaffiliated individuals who identify with Klan ideology Ã¢Â€Â” but turnover and lack of stability have diminished most groupsÃ¢Â€Â™ numbers. Even the largest Klans donÃ¢Â€Â™t appear to have many more than 50 to 100 active members, and most Klans have fewer than 25 members. In an attempt to bolster the appearance of unity and strength, some Klan groups have formed alliances with one another and joined forces with other white supremacist groups.

Approximately half of the currently active Klan groups subscribe to the beliefs of Ã¢Â€ÂœtraditionalÃ¢Â€Â white supremacists, the oldest segment of the white supremacist movement and which emerged out of opposition to civil rights for African-Americans. Such Klan members are predominantly anti-black, anti-immigration and homophobic. These groups are unwilling to associate with neo-Nazis or neo-Nazi groups. However, a growing number of Klans, approximately forty percent, promote a Klan ideology infused with neo-Nazi beliefs. The remaining ten percent are adherents of Christian Identity, a longstanding racist and anti-Semitic religious sect.

Members, associates, and supporters of the Klan are focused on their perceived threats to the white race, including the Black Lives Matter movement, Islam and the building of mosques, the LGBT community (particularly transgender restrooms), Ã¢Â€Âœblack on white crime,Ã¢Â€Â immigration (particularly Mexican), and the threatened removal of Confederate symbols from public spaces such as government buildings, parks, and schools.

The distribution of racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and Islamophobic fliers remains the most consistent Klan activity. From 2014 through 2016, the Anti-Defamation League tracked an average of 79 incidents per year in which Klan fliers were left on doorsteps or driveways in neighborhoods around the country. The Loyal White Knights are by far the most active fliering group; they are responsible for nearly half (128Ã‚Â out of 274Ã‚Â incidents) of the Klan leafletting efforts since January 2014.

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 


In addition to LWK, at least eight additional Klans have distributed fliers in 2017, including the American Christian Knights, Confederate White Knights, East Coast Knights, International Keystone Knights, Mississippi White Knights, Sacred Knights, Traditionalist American Knights, and the United Northern and Southern Knights.

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

In contrast to fliering efforts, Klan groups have been unable to show strength in number during public appearances. As of mid-June, this year, there have been three instances in which Klan groups have organized public rallies. In each case, the events were poorly attended even with the benefit of multiple Klan groups participating.

Madison, Indiana, May 27, 2017: Approximately 15 members and supporters of the Nordic Order Knights and the Southern Ohio Knights briefly rallied at FiremanÃ¢Â€Â™s Park.
Stuart, Virginia, June 10, 2017: Approximately 12 members and supporters of the Rebel Brigade Knights and the Confederate White Knights rallied in front of the Patrick County Court house.
Florence, Alabama, June 11, 2017: Approximately ten members and supporters of the Global Crusaders, the Exalted Knights and the International Keystone Knights protested an LGBTQ pride march.

The White Knights of the KKK of America (also known as the North Mississippi White Knights) promised a March 2017 demonstration at the Douglas County courthouse in Douglasville, Georgia, meant to protest lengthy sentences given to a Georgia couple following their conviction for threatening an African-American family during a childÃ¢Â€Â™s birthday party in July 2015. But the Klan was a no-show.

In other public appearances this year, a small number of Klan members have participated in events organized by other white supremacist groups. In May, Knights Party leader Thomas Robb and several of his members joined an Anti-fa protest organized by the League of the South in Harrison, Arkansas.

While in April, Bill Riccio along with five other Alabama members of the Global Crusader Knights participated in a neo-Nazi rally in Pikeville, Kentucky. Riccio (aka William Davidson) is a long-time white supremacist who gained notoriety in the early 1990Ã¢Â€Â™s as a leader of the racist skinhead movement.

The largest public appearance of Klan groups in 2016Ã‚Â occurred at a neo-Nazi event, during the neo-Nazi National Socialist MovementÃ¢Â€Â™s (NSM) annual April rally. Approximately 40 associates of the Loyal White Knights and the Texas Rebel Knights joined the NSM as they rallied in Rome, Georgia. Following this public rally, participants gathered for a private meeting and formed the Aryan Nationalist Alliance (ANA), a white supremacist umbrella group later renamed the Nationalist Front. According to the NSM's website,Ã‚Â the umbrella alliance currently consists of approximately 20 small white supremacist groups, including three Klan groups: the Texas Rebel Knights, the Pacific Coast Knights, and the Nordic Order Knights.

Five months later, on November 5, the NSM held its Fall rally on the steps of PennsylvaniaÃ¢Â€Â™s capitol building in Harrisburg, this time drawing approximately 15 associates of the White Knights of the KKK of America and Texas Rebel Knights.

Ã‚Â 

The largest Klan-organized public event in 2016 occurred on September 24 when approximately 10 members and associates of the Confederate White Knights (CWK) rallied at FiremanÃ¢Â€Â™s Park in Madison, Indiana. During the event CWK leaders Imperial Wizard Richard Preston and Indiana Grand Dragon Anthony Ã¢Â€ÂœTonyÃ¢Â€Â Berry delivered speeches that addressed government tyranny, bullying, and stopping drug abuse (with violence if necessary). They also denounced the Black Lives Matter movement.

Klan members continue to be linked to criminal activity and violence. In addition to the February arrest of Malissa Ancona, there have been several notable arrests of Klan members in 2017. In January, five members and associates of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of America were arrested on robbery charges in Union County, Mississippi. According to Sheriff Jimmy Edwards, a female suspect lured the victim to a church parking area where he was threatened and robbed of his cell phone and wallet.

Another arrest occurred in South Carolina in February, when FBI agents arrested Benjamin Thomas Samuel McDowell of Conway, South Carolina, alleging heÃ¢Â€Â™d purchased a gun from an undercover FBI agent who was posing as someone connected with a faction of the neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations. McDowell, a convicted felon not allowed to own guns, was charged with illegal possession of a firearm. According to authorities, McDowell also indicated to the agent that he was interested in committing a Ã¢Â€ÂœDylann Roof-styleÃ¢Â€Â violent attack. He was a member of the Alabama-based United Klans of America.

However, after the killing, JacksonÃ¢Â€Â™s angry energy dissipated and he turned himself over to the authorities.Ã‚Â  A week later, New York prosecutors announced that they were charging him with second-degree murder as a hate crime and also with a state charge of terrorism.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

JacksonÃ¢Â€Â™s aborted killing spree was a shocking example of right-wing terror in the United States but it was unfortunately far from an isolated example.

Ã‚Â 

For over a century and a half, since Ã¢Â€Âœburning KansasÃ¢Â€Â of the 1850s and the Ku Klux Klan of the 1860s, right-wing terrorism has been an unwelcome feature of the American landscape.Ã‚Â  Yet today, many people are barely aware that it exists and most people donÃ¢Â€Â™t recognize its frequency or scope.

Ã‚Â 

Far more attention in recent years has been given to the threat of homegrown radical Islamic terrorÃ¢Â€Â”a danger that has generated such horrific acts as the Orlando and San Bernardino shooting sprees.Ã‚Â  Yet the very real specter of radical Islamic terror in the United States has existed alongside an equally serious threat of terror from right-wing extremist groups and individuals.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Both movements have generated shooting sprees, bombings, and a wide variety of plots and conspiracies.Ã‚Â  Both pose threats so significant that to ignore either would be to invite tragedy.

Ã‚Â 

To illustrate the threat of right-wing terrorism in the United States, the Anti-Defamation LeagueÃ¢Â€Â™s Center on Extremism has compiled a list of 150 right-wing terrorist acts, attempted acts, plots and conspiracies from the past 25 years (1993-2017).Ã‚Â  These include terrorist incidents from a wide variety of white supremacists, from neo-Nazis to Klansmen to racist skinheads, as well as incidents connected to anti-government extremists such as militia groups, sovereign citizens and tax protesters.Ã‚Â  The list also includes incidents of anti-abortion terror as well as from other, smaller right-wing extremist movements.

Ã‚Â 

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Center on Extremism defines terrorism as a pre-planned act or attempted act of significant violence by one or more non-state actors in order to further an ideological, social or religious cause, or to harm perceived opponents of such causes. Ã‚Â Significant violent acts can include bombings or use of other weapons of mass destruction, assassinations and targeted killings, shooting sprees, arsons and firebombings, kidnappings and hostage situations and, in some cases, armed robberies.Ã‚Â  Domestic terrorism consists of acts or attempted acts of terrorism in which the perpetrators are citizens or permanent residents of the country in which the act takes place.

Ã‚Â 

The right-wing terrorist incidents in ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s list include those that best fit the above criteria.Ã‚Â  They are drawn from the much larger pool of violent and criminal acts that American right-wing extremists engage in every year, from hate crimes to deadly encounters with law enforcement.Ã‚Â  Right-wing extremists annually murder a number of Americans, but only some of those murders occur in connection with terrorist acts.Ã‚Â  There are, after all, hundreds of thousands of adherents of right-wing extremist movements in the United States and all such movements have some degree of association with criminal activity.Ã‚Â  No one should think, therefore, that the incidents listed here represent the breadth of right-wing violence in the U.S.Ã‚Â  But, as acts of terrorism, they do show right-wing movements at their most vicious and ambitious.

Ã‚Â 

The Perpetrators

Ã‚Â 

The people who committed or attempted the terrorist acts listed here came from a variety of right-wing extremist movements.Ã‚Â  In a few cases, extremists connected to terror incidents here even adhered to more than one right-wing extremist movement; in such cases, the seemingly dominant ideology was selected for statistical purposes. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, for example, was primarily an anti-government extremist but also had white supremacist leanings.Ã‚Â  Richard Poplawski, who gunned down three police officers in Pittsburgh, was a white supremacist who also had leanings towards the anti-government movement.

Ã‚Â 

Most right-wing extremists in the United States fall into one of two broad umbrella movements or spheres: Ã‚Â white supremacists and anti-government extremists.Ã‚Â  An overwhelming majority of the terror incidents listed here (85%) were committed by adherents of one of these two spheres.Ã‚Â  Moreover, the number of acts attributed to each sphere is almost identical:Ã‚Â  64 terror incidents are related to white supremacists, while 63 are related to anti-government extremists.Ã‚Â  Many people, when picturing right-wing terrorism, tend to think of white supremacists, but anti-government extremists such as militia groups and sovereign citizens pose just as much of a threat.

Ã‚Â 

White supremacists involved in right-wing terror incidents include adherents of every major segment of the white supremacist movement, including neo-Nazis, racist skinheads, Ã¢Â€ÂœtraditionalÃ¢Â€Â white supremacists (such as Ku Klux Klan groups), white supremacist prison gangs, the religious sect Christian Identity, and the Alt Right.Ã‚Â  Leaving aside dual-movement extremists such as Timothy McVeigh, the worst white supremacist terrorist was Dylann Roof, a Ã¢Â€ÂœtraditionalÃ¢Â€Â white supremacist who embarked upon a deadly shooting spree at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, killing nine.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The anti-government extremists, who are often collectively termed the Ã¢Â€ÂœPatriotÃ¢Â€Â movement, consist primarily of adherents of the tax protest movement, the sovereign citizen movement, and the militia movement (with the latter including Oath Keepers and Three Percenters).Ã‚Â  Though the Ã¢Â€ÂœPatriotÃ¢Â€Â movement goes back to the mid-1960s, it was in the mid-1990s that it really came into its own in terms of becoming a major domestic terrorist threat, one that equaled the threat posed by white supremacists.Ã‚Â  Oklahoma City bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were dedicated adherents of the Ã¢Â€ÂœPatriotÃ¢Â€Â movement and their 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal Building gave notice that anti-government extremists now posed a major threat.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

It is common for the media and others to assume that anti-government extremists are also mostly white supremacists, but this is not the case.Ã‚Â  Though there is some overlap between the two spheres, the main anti-government extremist movements direct their anger at the government and there have always been people of color in these movements.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Indeed, the sovereign citizen movement in particular has unfortunately seen particularly strong growth within the African-American community in recent years. Two of the sovereign-citizen related incidents on this list, the LaPlace, Louisiana, shootings in 2012 and the Columbus, Ohio, bomb-making attempt in 2016, involved African-Americans. Ã‚Â Two incidents not included on this list involved extremists who were primarily black nationalists but who had secondary sovereign citizen affiliations: Ã‚Â the 2014 plot by two men to blow up the Gateway Arch and kill law enforcement officials in St. Louis, Missouri, and the 2016 deadly ambush killings of three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Ã‚Â 

The militia movement has spent much of its history trying to distance itself from accusations of racism or white supremacy but in recent years much of the movement has willingly embraced a particular type of bigotry:Ã‚Â  anti-Muslim hatred.Ã‚Â  This Islamophobia has taken numerous forms, from armed protests in front of mosques to a major terrorist plot in October 2016 in Garden City, Kansas, where three militia members were arrested in connection with an alleged plot to blow up an apartment complex that primarily housed Muslim Somali-American residents. The militia movement could produce more such terror attempts aimed at Muslims in the future.

Ã‚Â 

Anti-abortion extremists are responsible for 11% of the terror incidents collected here.Ã‚Â  Compared to the incidents connected to white supremacists or anti-government extremists, the number of abortion related terror attacks and attempts is low.Ã‚Â  However, given the small number of anti-abortion extremists relative to adherents of the other, much larger movements, the consistent stream of terror incidents that flow from this movement is worrisome.

Ã‚Â 

Anti-abortion extremists are an example of what is called Ã¢Â€Âœsingle-issue extremism.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Single-issue extremists are typically the extreme wing of a broader, more mainstream movement dedicated to a single cause or issue. While most people in those movements would not think of committing acts of violence, adherents of the extreme wing of those movements are more likely to consider violent activity, operating under a sense of extreme urgency and with a conviction that the ends justify the means.Ã‚Â  A few other right-wing single issue extremists, such as anti-Muslim extremists and anti-immigration extremists, have also committed violent acts included among the 150 listed here.

Ã‚Â 

All of the perpetrators and alleged perpetrators listed in this report have ties to extremist ideologies, but not all of them actually have had connections to specific extremist groups.Ã‚Â  Indeed, Ã¢Â€Âœterrorist groupsÃ¢Â€Â as suchÃ¢Â€Â”i.e., groups that form and exist largely for the purpose of committing terrorist actsÃ¢Â€Â”are rare in the United States, where the rule of law is strong and such groups have great difficulties in finding purchase.Ã‚Â  Even when extremists are connected to specific groups, they rarely commit their actions at the direction of the group.Ã‚Â  Rather, extremist groups in the United States tend to serve a purpose of radicalization more than anything else, whether of their own members or, as in the case of Dylann Roof, of non-members who may be influenced by their propaganda.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The perpetrators of some of the incidents on this list were part of formal groups, while others were essentially involved in Ã¢Â€ÂœcellsÃ¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Â”informal associations of extremists banding together to commit an act.Ã‚Â  But just as common as these two types were lone offendersÃ¢Â€Â”the Ã¢Â€Âœlone wolfÃ¢Â€Â terrorists responsible for a large number of AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s terror incidents.Ã‚Â  Indeed, approximately half of the 150 incidents listed in this report involved lone wolf offenders.Ã‚Â  Today, thanks to the Internet, it is easier than ever for someone to become steeped in extremist ideologies, even to the point of being willing to commit acts of great violence, without ever being involved in an organized extremist group.

Ã‚Â 

The Incidents

Ã‚Â 

The list in this report includes 150 incidents involving acts, attempted acts, and plots of right-wing terrorism from 1993 through part of 2017.Ã‚Â  A few of these terror acts are well-known, such as the bombings conducted by Timothy McVeigh and Eric Rudolph, while many other incidents garnered little more than local media coverage and are unknown to most Americans.Ã‚Â  Such lists always involve some value judgments on the margins and there are some incidents on the list that some people might think donÃ¢Â€Â™t belong on such a list, while there are items missing from the list that some people might think should be included, such as the armed standoffs involving members of the Bundy family and others in Nevada in 2014 and Oregon in 2016.

Ã‚Â 

In many cases where a possible incident was not included, it was for one of several reasons.Ã‚Â  First, for some reported incidents, an extremist connection has never been satisfactorily established or has in fact been disproved.Ã‚Â  For example, in 2014 Dennis Marx attempted to use firearms and explosives to attack an Atlanta courthouse; some media outlets reported or speculated that Marx was a sovereign citizen. However, no evidence confirming this ever emerged and the police eventually acknowledged he had not been involved in the movement.Ã‚Â  Similarly, some media speculated that Jared Lee Loughner, who shot Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others in a 2011 shooting spree in Arizona, was a sovereign citizen, but this also turned out to be untrue.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

An additional group of incidents did not make the list because, while an extremist definitely committed an act of significant violence, the act was a spontaneous act of violence without noticeable premeditation; such acts are usually not included here.Ã‚Â  Finally, some incidentsÃ¢Â€Â”usually discoveries of extremists with major illegal arsenals of weapons and/or explosivesÃ¢Â€Â”were not included because there was insufficient evidence of any target or intent to use the weapons for an act of terrorism.Ã‚Â  The incidents in these two categories are serious criminal violations but not really incidents of terrorism.

Ã‚Â 

Those omissions still leave 150 terror incidents from the last quarter-century.Ã‚Â  This lengthy string of dangerous attacks and plots illustrates how deeply seated the threat of right-wing terrorism is in the United States.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

A look at these 150 incidents over time reveals that two specific surges of right-wing terrorism have occurred over the past 25 years.Ã‚Â  The first was the surge of the mid-to-late 1990s, a result of a great increase in right-wing extremism as a result of a variety of factors that include the election of Bill Clinton, the passage of NAFTA, the passage of gun control measures such as the Brady Law and the Assault Weapons Ban, and the deadly standoffs at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992 and Waco, Texas, in 1993, which energized white supremacists and anti-government extremists, respectively.

Ã‚Â 

The 1990s surge had died down by the turn of the century and right-wing terrorism occurred less frequently in the early-to-mid 2000s. Events ranging from the non-event of a Y2K-related disaster to the replacement of Bill Clinton with George W. Bush to the 9/11 terror attacks all played a role in dampening right-wing furor.

Ã‚Â 

Unfortunately, this state of affairs did not last.Ã‚Â  Near the end of BushÃ¢Â€Â™s second term, right-wing terror incidents began to increase again and this trend accelerated by 2009, thanks in part to the election of Barack Obama, whom both white supremacists and anti-government extremists hated, and to the major economic disasters of the Great Recession and the foreclosure crisis.Ã‚Â  The latter two in particular allowed the sovereign citizen movement to greatly expand.Ã‚Â  The result was a second surge of right-wing extremism, one that was accompanied by a surge of right-wing terror incidents.Ã‚Â  This increased level of terror-related activity remains high today, though whether or not it will sustain itself during a Trump administration remains to be seen.

Ã‚Â 

The worst right-wing terror attack, the Oklahoma City bombing, killed 168 people and injured hundreds more.Ã‚Â  Thankfully, none of the other incidents achieved anywhere near that level of lethality and destructiveness.Ã‚Â  In large part, this has been due to effective law enforcement, at both the federal and state/local levels, who have uncovered and prevented many attempts at terrorist acts.Ã‚Â  Indeed, only a minority of the incidents recorded hereÃ¢Â€Â”65 out of 150--could be considered Ã¢Â€ÂœsuccessfulÃ¢Â€Â acts, by which is meant that the terrorist(s) succeeded in carrying out part or all of their plan or were able to wreak some sort of damage (such as shooting someone) while attempting to carry out their plan.Ã‚Â  This does not include bombs that were successfully planted but which failed to go off.

Ã‚Â 

Some of the attempted acts never had a good chance of success, while others could easily have been deadly.Ã‚Â  Even though most terror incidents were not successes, the minority that did succeed resulted in 255 deaths and approximately 603 people injured (not all injury counts are consistent).Ã‚Â  Were it not for the efforts of law enforcement to detect and prevent right-wing acts of terror, that deadly toll would be far higher still.

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

To accomplish their deadly aims, extremists used a variety of tools and tactics, but overwhelmingly firearms and explosives were the most common weapons chosen. Indeed, 55 of the 150 terror incidents involved use or planned use of firearms, while another 55 involved explosives.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Moreover, of the 17 incidents involving multiple weapons types, firearms and explosives were by far the most common combination.

Ã‚Â 

It is worth nothing that, although bombs were used or considered by extremists just as often as firearms, their successful use rate was much lower.Ã‚Â  This is largely due to the fact that explosives are far more difficult to obtain and to use in the United States than are firearms, which are abundant, easy to use, and very deadly. There is far better regulation of explosives than firearms in the United States.

Ã‚Â 

In a minority of cases, right-wing extremists attempted arsons or incendiary devices such as Molotov cocktails; abortion clinics were a frequent target of such violence.Ã‚Â  And, from time to time, extremists would select more exotic means of murder, such as using the deadly toxin ricin or poisoning a water supply or trying to build a radiological weapon.

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Whatever weapon they planned to use against their targets, right-wing extremists have had no shortage of targets.Ã‚Â  Indeed, some ambitious plots have contained an entire array of targets slated for death and destruction.

Ã‚Â 

Of the various targets of right-wing anger, it is governmental and law enforcement institutions that are most often threatened.Ã‚Â  Of the incidents examined here, 66 involved some sort of government-related target. This is largely due to the fact that white supremacists and anti-government extremists alike, as well as most of the lesser right-wing movements, hate government and law enforcement.Ã‚Â  This category includes federal, state and local branches of government and law enforcement.

Ã‚Â 

White supremacists are responsible for most of the racial and religious targeting.Ã‚Â  Virtually any person or institution associated with a non-white race can be a potential target for white supremacists, but African-Americans, Hispanics, and multi-racial couples/families have been the most common groups victimized.Ã‚Â  The most frequent religious targets were, not surprisingly, Jews and Muslims (including non-Muslims perceived as Muslims). Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Actual or perceived immigrants, as well as LGBT targets, were also subject to victimization.

Ã‚Â 

Abortion-related targets, typically clinics that provide abortion services as well as the people who work at such places, were also common.Ã‚Â  While anti-abortion extremists were the extremists most likely to attack abortion-related targets, other right-wing extremists, most noticeably white supremacists, also occasionally attempted such attacks.

Ã‚Â 

Right-wing extremist have also taken aim at a variety of other targets.Ã‚Â  Commercial targets have included various businesses and, in particular, financial institutions.Ã‚Â  Infrastructure targets include a wide range of installations, from refineries to dams to water supplies.Ã‚Â  In some cases, extremists have simply targeted crowded public areas, hoping to cause significant human casualties.

Ã‚Â 

The Present and Future of Right-Wing Terrorism

Ã‚Â 

Over the past 25 years, right-wing terrorism has exhibited a considerable amount of stability.Ã‚Â  Part of this is due to the fact that most of it comes from two mature and well-established movements:Ã‚Â  the white supremacist movement and the anti-government Ã¢Â€ÂœPatriotÃ¢Â€Â movement. They have specific goals and specific enemies and can be expected to produce a steady stream of extremists willing to use violence to achieve those goals or harm those enemies.Ã‚Â  Moreover, though fringe movements, they nevertheless have deep roots in American society and cannot simply be rooted out or eliminated. Right-wing terrorism is not going away anytime soon.

Ã‚Â 

On the plus side, law enforcement is collectively far more familiar with right-wing extremist movements than it may be with newer types of extremist movements, which enables it to utilize informants and undercover officers to a much fuller extent than might otherwise be the case.Ã‚Â  It is no coincidence that a number of the prevented acts recounted in this study were prevented thanks to Ã¢Â€ÂœstingÃ¢Â€Â operations, which are one of the most consistently successful law enforcement tools against terrorismÃ¢Â€Â”as long as law enforcement is sufficiently familiar with the relevant movement(s).

Ã‚Â 

Most of the 25 years examined here for right-wing terrorism have occurred in what can be deemed the Ã¢Â€ÂœInternet era.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  However, the Internet of the mid-1990s was very different than that of ten years later or todayÃ¢Â€Â™s on-line world.Ã‚Â  Overall, right-wing terrorism has remained pretty consistent throughout this era, but the evolution of the Internet has resulted in some changes.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

In particular, the social networking revolution that occurred during the period 2006-2009 has made it easier for extremist ideas and tactics to spread very far, very fast.Ã‚Â  This can allow new extremist movements, such as the white supremacist Alt Right, to quickly gain purchase, and can allow established movement, such as the sovereign citizen movement, to rapidly resurge.Ã‚Â  Social networking has also allowed extremists to meet each other and even to plot on-line.Ã‚Â  The October 2008 school attack plot in Tennessee and the Georgia militia plot of February 2014 are two examples where extremists who met on-line later joined up in the Ã¢Â€Âœreal worldÃ¢Â€Â to plot terrorist acts.

Ã‚Â 

The Internet may also have made lone wolf terrorismÃ¢Â€Â”terrorism committed by a lone perpetrator not acting at the behest of any organized groupÃ¢Â€Â”a more common phenomenon, because one can now self-radicalize using on-line resources with little need to engage with other extremists in the Ã¢Â€Âœreal world.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  The shooting sprees of Keith Luke in 2009 and Dylann Roof in 2015 are examples of terrorist acts committed by lone extremists who radicalized on-line with little or no real interaction with other extremists. Lone wolves have long existed within AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s radical right, but could be even more likely in the future.

Ã‚Â 

Finally, for the past quarter of a century, right-wing terrorism has been a consistent feature in the landscape of American violence, but it has garnered far less notice than some other forms of terrorism, most notably Islamic terrorism.Ã‚Â  Though a few incidents, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, or the bombings of Eric Rudoph, received extensive media coverage, many of the incidents collected here received scant media attention, particularly from major national media sources.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

One reason for this under-coverage may be very simple:Ã‚Â  a surprising number of the terrorist acts and plots listed here originated away from major media centers. While some incidents took place in locations such as New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles, many others occurred in out-of-the-way places such as Garden City, Kansas; Fairbanks, Alaska; or Lenoir, Tennessee.Ã‚Â  As a result, such incidents are less likely to get national media attention and, if they get any, less likely to get sustained coverage.

Ã‚Â 

Whatever the reasons for the lack of coverage, one of its consequences has been an inadequate awareness among policy-makers and the public alike of the threat posed by violent right-wing extremists. Today, the United States still does not even have a federal domestic terrorism statute.Ã‚Â  Federal spending on training law enforcement on issues such as right-wing violence and terrorism is extremely low.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

One thing is certain: if the United States does not treat right-wing terrorism as a real threat and react appropriately, there is no chance of lessening the danger posed by violent right-wing extremists and the 150 terror incidents described in this report will be joined by still more.","[1, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/tattered-robes-state-ku-klux-klan-united-states,"Read the full report here: Tattered Robes: The State of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States (PDF).

Despite a persistent ability to attract media attention, organized Ku Klux Klan groups are actually continuing a long-term trend of decline. They remain a collection of mostly small, disjointed groups that continually change in name and leadership. Down slightly from a year ago, there are currently just over thirty active Klan groups in the United States, most of them very small. However, the association of Klan members with criminal activity has remained consistent.

The long-term decline of Ku Klux Klan groups is due to several factors, including increasing societal rejection of what the Klan stands for; a growing perception by white supremacists that Klan groups are outdated; and competition with other white supremacist movements, from racist skinheads to white supremacist prison gangs, over the small pool of potential recruits. In recent years, one of the clearest signs of the declining state of Ku Klux Klan groups has been in their complete inability to maintain anything resembling stability.

More than half of the currently active Klan groups were formed only in the last five years. This is not, as it may first seem, a sign of growth, but rather illustrates how short-lived todayÃ¢Â€Â™s Ku Klux Klan groups actually tend to be. Just some of the recently disbanded Klan groups include the Aryan Nations Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the Eastern White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and the United Dixie White Knights.

While a few longstanding Klan groups still exist, they continue to fade away. Just a decade ago, Klan groups such as the White Camelia Knights, the Mississippi White Knights, and the Church of the National Knights exhibited consistent activity. Today, all three are mere shadows of their former selves. Despite their diminishing numbers, there are still approximately 3,000 Klan members nationwide, as well an additional but unknown number of associates and supporters. Even with relatively small numbers, groups like the North Carolinabased Loyal White Knights (LWK), perhaps the most active Klan group in the United States today, have a fairly expansive geographical reach. In 2015, with just 150-200 members, they were able to draw attention to themselves in 15 different states (mostly in the south and east), typically through fliering, which requires only a single participant.

Other Klan groups are smaller stillÃ¢Â€Â”often considerably smaller. For example, the Kentucky-based Elders Blood-NBlood Out Knights (EBBOK) consists of just a handful of members. Formed in 2015 by disgruntled members of the LWK who believe the LWK leader, Christopher Barker, had been a federal informant against another Klansman, EBBOK also serves as an example of the fractious and unstable nature of Ku Klux Klan groups.

Many of the newer Klan groups promote a traditional Klan ideology infused with neo-Nazi beliefs, continuing a trend from the early 2000s. EBBOK itself is one of these, its website explaining, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are a Christian hate group. We are a group unlike other groups. We accept all Nazis and skin heads (sic) cause we have the same beliefs.Ã¢Â€Â Two such Klan groups have already formed in 2016: the Great Lake Knights, based in Alpena, Michigan, and the Pacific Coast Knights of Spokane, Washington.",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.0}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/bds-american-college-campuses-2014-15-year-review,"There was an increase in anti-Israel activity on American college campuses during the latest academic year with students actively working to promote Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns against Israel. Student groups that are well-known for their efforts to isolate the Jewish state advocated for a variety of BDS-related initiatives in an effort to push forward their agenda and punish Israel.

The most prevalent BDS initiative on campus involved the introduction of divestment resolutions and referenda by various anti-Israel student groups. Nineteen campuses held votes on such resolutions or referenda in the 2014-15 academic year. Although none of the resolutions or referenda are binding or are likely to alter university policy, support for these initiatives in some cases created a divisive atmosphere on campus.

While weeklong programs like Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraeli Apartheid WeekÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestine Awareness WeekÃ¢Â€Â continued to wane in popularity among anti-Israel students over the past year Ã¢Â€Â“ as indicated by fewer schools participating and less general buzz around these programs Ã¢Â€Â“ there was a significant increase in anti-Israel events overall. Ã‚Â 520 explicitly anti-Israel events and programs took place nationwide on college campuses, representing a 30% increase from the previous academic year. Ã‚Â Well over 50% of these events focused various aspects of the BDS movement.

Ã‚Â 

Below is an alphabetically organized list of the universities that considered divestment resolutions or referendums this year, including the results of these votes:'

Bowdoin College: A BDS referendum was voted down at Bowdoin College where 85% of the total student body reportedly voted. 71% were opposed to the referendum and 14% voted in favor of it.
DePaul University:Ã‚Â  A BDS referendum was passed at DePaul University during the 2013-14 academic year, but their request was denied by the DePaul University Fair Business Practices Committee in January 2015.
Earlham College: A BDS resolution was reportedly endorsed by the Student Senate at Earlham College on Tuesday, April 21, 2015.
Loyola University:Ã‚Â  A BDS resolution was passed by the student government at Loyola University on Tuesday, March 24, 2015. The final vote was 16-15-2.Ã‚Â 
Marquette University:Ã‚Â  A resolution titled Ã¢Â€ÂœRecommendation #1 Socially Responsible InvestmentÃ¢Â€Â was passed at Marquette University on April 28, 2015 with a vote of 25-3-0. The resolution did not mention the word Ã¢Â€Â˜divestmentÃ¢Â€Â™ or name specific corporations that are allegedly responsible for Palestinian human rights violations.
Northeastern University:Ã‚Â  A BDS resolution was voted down by the Student Senate at Northeastern University with a 25-9 vote.
Northwestern University:Ã‚Â  The Northwestern student government passed a BDS resolution on Wednesday, February 18, 2015. The vote was 24-22-3.
Oglethorpe University: The Student Government Association (SGA) at Oglethorpe University reportedly passed a BDS resolution submitted by Students for Justice in Palestine on Friday, May 1, 2015.
Princeton University:Ã‚Â  A BDS referendum at Princeton University was voted down with 965 (47.5%) for divestment and 1,067 (52.5%) against divestment.
San Diego State University (SDSU): A BDS referendum proposed by SJP failed at SDSU. The vote count was 1701-1500 and SJP did not gain the 2/3 majority that they needed in order to pass it.
Stanford University: The Undergraduate Senate of Stanford University voted 10-4-1 to pass a BDS resolution submitted by the student group Stanford Out of Occupied Palestine on Tuesday, February 17, 2015.
University of California-Davis (UC Davis): The UC Davis Student Senate passed a divestment resolution that was submitted by the Students for Justice in Palestine chapter on Thursday, January 29, 2015. The vote on the resolution was 8-2-2, but it was challenged and overturned by the student-led Court of Associated Students.
University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA): Ã¢Â€ÂœA Resolution to Divest from Corporations Engaged in Violence against PalestiniansÃ¢Â€Â was passed by the UCLA student government. The resolution, which was reportedly sponsored by 15 student organizations and endorsed by another 17, was passed by an 8-2-2 margin on November 18, 2014.
University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB): A vote on a BDS resolution took place on April 22, 2015 at UC Santa Barbara. The result of the vote was 12-12-1 and the Internal Vice President Angela Lau broke the tie by voting no against the resolution.
University of California Student Workers Union (UAW 2865): The University of California Student Workers Union (UAW 2865) endorsed a divestment resolution on Thursday, December 4, 2014 calling on the UC Board of Regents to divest from companies that are allegedly profiting from or aiding in the Israeli occupation. The resolution also called for an end of U.S. aid to Israel and for UAW International to divest from the same corporations. The vote was 1411-749.
University of Michigan: A BDS resolution failed to pass at the University of Michigan after the Central Student Government voted 15-25 against endorsing the resolution which was presented by SAFE on April 3, 2015.

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Efforts to Counter BDS

Since September 2014, ADL has been running a program called Words to Action: Empowering Jewish Students to Address Bias on Campus, which is an interactive education program for college and pre-college students that is designed to empower and equip them with constructive and effective responses to combat anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias on campus;Ã‚Â 
ADL launched a new Twitter account (@CampusADL) to directly engage with Jewish and pro-Israel groups and students on college and university campuses throughout the country. Through this account, ADL has provided students with ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s perspectives, backgrounders, and other resources to help them address anti-Israel activity, as well as to alert them about upcoming events and campaigns;
ADL trained students on how to lobby against divestment and present a pro-Israel viewpoint. ADL also provided students with factsheets, research and talking points about the BDS movement;
ADL encouraged university chancellors and administrators to speak out against divestment resolutions and assert that the campus in question will not entertain divestment;
ADL issued public statements condemning divestment resolutions that had passed and praising university leaders for speaking out against them;
ADL advised high-level university administrators about proactive measures to create a safe and comfortable campus environment for all students, reminding them that Jewish and pro-Israel students can feel isolated or intimidated by extreme.",[4],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.5}",HIGH

In 2015, 80 U.S. residents were linked to terror plots and other activity motivated by Islamic extremist ideology.Ã‚Â  They were either arrested, charged or otherwise publicly identified for their involvement in crimes ranging from providing support, attempting to fund or traveling to join terrorist groups abroad, or planning or assisting in plots here at home.

This is a level of activity by U.S. residents inspired by foreign terrorist organizations never before seen. The 2015 numbers Ã¢Â€Â“ up 180% from 2014 Ã¢Â€Â“ are a result of a confluence of global trends, technological advances and the constant tide of terrorist messages and propaganda.

In 2015 for the first time, nearly as many Americans were killed by domestic Islamic extremists as by white supremacists.

And the spike in arrests and violence does not seem to be confined to 2015. In the first month of 2016, at least 6 U.S. residents were linked criminal activity motivated by Islamic extremist ideologies. Following on the heels of the record-breaking number of terror related arrests in 2015, these new arrests further underscore the persistent nature of the threat.

Ongoing unrest in the Middle East, particularly in relation to the ongoing Syrian civil war, continued to provide opportunities for terrorist organizations to operate and gain strength. As in 2014, the majority of the U.S. residents linked to terror in 2015 supported the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS, also known as IS or ISIL), which is based in Syria and Iraq and has affiliates in a number of other countries including Egypt, Libya and Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, ISIS and other terrorist groups continue to take advantage of technology to mobilize followers, spread their messages and expand their influence worldwide. The internet and social media sites in particular, remain a pivotal element of the modern radicalization process. Online social interactions facilitate the spread of extremist messages Ã¢Â€Â“ making them available to almost anyone, virtually anywhere Ã¢Â€Â“ and create a climate where susceptible individuals are simultaneously targeted by recruiters and are able to develop remote networks that reinforce their burgeoning extremist allegiances.

Understanding the progression of U.S. residents engaged in activity motivated by Islamic extremist ideology can provide valuable insights into future security challenges.",[],"{1: 0.0, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.0}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/anatomy-standoff,"Read the full comprehensive report,Ã‚Â Anatomy of a Standoff:Ã‚Â  The Occupiers of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HeadquartersÃ‚Â (PDF).

On January 2, a loosely organized group of armed anti-government extremists led by Ammon Bundy seized control of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters buildings located near the town of Burns in remote southeastern Oregon.Ã‚Â  They did it because two local ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, had been ordered to report to federal prison to serve a sentence for arson.Ã‚Â 

Since seizing the headquartersÃ¢Â€Â”empty at the timeÃ¢Â€Â”the extremists have refused to leave and have instead used social media extensively in an effort to gather support from other right-wing extremist groups and individuals.Ã‚Â  Mainstream media outlets have also flocked to the scene, interviewing many of the participants in the takeover.Ã‚Â 

After several days, the extremists finally gave themselves a name:Ã‚Â  Citizens for Constitutional Freedom.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  But who are these Ã¢Â€ÂœCitizensÃ¢Â€Â and what are their beliefs and backgrounds?Ã‚Â  Experts with the Anti-Defamation LeagueÃ¢Â€Â™s Center on Extremism have attempted to identify as many of the participants in the takeover as possible, watching and reading many interviews and scouring hundreds of profiles and videos on social media.

This report provides mini-profiles on 30 different occupiers and allies who have been at the wildlife refuge headquarters examining their backgrounds, ideologies, and activities.Ã‚Â  It also analyzes the composition of the occupiers, illustrating a number of important aspects to the participants in the takeover, including:

The importance of the 2014 Bundy Ranch standoff.Ã‚Â  Of the 30 occupiers detailed in this report, more than half (17 of 30) appear to have actually participated in the earlier standoff between Cliven Bundy and the federal government in Nevada in 2014, including almost all of the key participants.Ã‚Â  The 2016 Oregon standoff is a direct sequel to its 2014 predecessor.
The ideological backgrounds of the extremists.Ã‚Â  About two-thirds of the occupiers appear to have the anti-government ""Patriot"" movement - and more specifically, the militia wing of that movement - as their primary ideological affiliation.Ã‚Â  The remaining one-third of the occupiers have an anti-government ideology centered on opposition to federal regulation of public lands, a movement often referred to as the Sagebrush Rebellion or the Wise Use movement.Ã‚Â  Some of the occupiers also have associations with other right-wing extremist movements, such as anti-immigrant border vigilantes or the sovereign citizen movement.Ã‚Â  Almost a quarter of the takeover participants have expressed some sort of racism, anti-Semitism, or anti-Muslim bigotry.
The lack of local participation.Ã‚Â  The overwhelming majority of the identified occupiers (25 out of 30) came from out of state, mostly from Arizona, Utah, and Nevada.Ã‚Â  Only five were from anywhere in Oregon.Ã‚Â  The takeover is an example of outsiders coming into a local areaÃ‚Â to pursueÃ‚Â their own agenda.Ã‚Â 
The relative lack of leadership and experience. Most of the extremists involved in the takeover are not prominent or well known, even to other extremists.Ã‚Â  Many of them are also relatively newly radicalized.Ã‚Â  Few have any leadership experiences with extremist groups or causes.Ã‚Â  This may have accounted for the general indecisiveness and uncertainty that has characterized much of their activity since the initial seizure.","[1, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/bds-american-college-campuses-2013-14-year-review,"Anti-Israel activity on American college campuses was largely dominated by Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns in the latest academic year. Student groups that are well-known for their outspoken opposition to Israeli policy advocated for a variety of BDS-related initiatives in an effort to isolate and delegitimize Israel.

The most prevalent BDS initiative on campus involved the introduction and debate of divestment resolutions by the campusÃ¢Â€Â™s student government. Fifteen campuses experienced such resolutions in the 2013-14 academic year. In addition, two academic associations voted to boycott Israeli academic institutions and one school in South Florida circulated a petition to divest from Israel that reportedly received more than 10,000 signatures. Moreover, the vast majority of the approximately 400 explicitly anti-Israel events and programs that took place on college campuses this year focused on BDS as the best tactic available to dismantle the so-called Ã¢Â€ÂœapartheidÃ¢Â€Â state of Israel.

While weeklong programs like Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraeli Apartheid WeekÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestine Awareness WeekÃ¢Â€Â seem to have waned in popularity among anti-Israel students in recent years Ã¢Â€Â“ as indicated by fewer schools participating and less general buzz around these programs Ã¢Â€Â“ BDS initiatives are clearly on the upswing. A comparison from just one year earlier is startling. Eight college campuses considered BDS resolutions in the 2012-13 academic year as opposed to fifteen, representing a nearly 100% increase in the tactic.

Although this data indicates a proliferation of BDS-related activity, it does not necessarily portend increased success for the BDS movement. Indeed, four of the resolutions passed in 2012-13 (50%) while only five passed this year (33%).

Perhaps more concerning, however, is the extent to which support for BDS has seeped into the realm of scholars. In 2013 resolutions calling for the boycott of Israeli academic institutions were passed by two academic associations, the American Studies Association and the Asian American Studies Association.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Divestment Resolutions and Referenda

Below is an alphabetically organized list of the universities that considered divestment resolutions or referendums this year, including the results of these votes:

Arizona State University: Resolution was tabled indefinitely on March 18, 2014.

Members of the pro-Israel community can take comfort in the fact that BDS efforts continue When the ASA passed boycott its Ã‚Â resolution, for example, more than 200 university presidents issued public statements denouncing the measures and distancing their universities from the results of these votes. More broadly, student-driven BDS resolutions cannot compel the university to alter its investments and are almost always summarily rejected by the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s administration as inconsistent with the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s policies

The New Black Panther Party for Self Defense (NBPP) is the largest organized anti-Semitic and racist Black militant group in America. Since October 2013, Hashim Nzinga, who preÃ‚Â­viÃ‚Â­ously served as the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s Chief of Staff, has led the group.

By taking on racially-charged issues, the NBPP has received national media attention for its efforts, garnered some support from prominent members of the African-American community, and attempted to attract followers. The group's demonstrations, conferences, and other events often blend inflammatory bigotry with calls for violence, tarnishing its efforts to present itself as a responsible voice that addresses concerns in the African-American community.

The group often attracts attention for its threats against police, which the NBPP views as culpable for Black suffering in the U.S.Ã‚Â  Most recently, the group made several threats against local law enforcement in response to the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri.

Ã‚Â 

The NBPP's divisive positions have been condemned by members of the original Black Panthers. Co-founder Bobby Seale believes that the NBPP has Ã¢Â€Âœhijacked our name and are hijacking our history.Ã¢Â€Â David Hilliard, a former Panther and executive director of the Dr. Huey P. Newton Foundation, has said that the racism that the group Ã¢Â€Âœespouse[s] flies directly in the face of the Black Panthers' multicultural ideology and purpose.Ã¢Â€Â The NBPP continues to use the Panther name and logo in spite of a permanent injunction prohibiting them from using either, which the original Panthers obtained in May 1997.","[2, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.1, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Panelists were selected based on their expertise in curriculum, multicultural education and teaching.

Findings

The findings of the panel were very favorable. Overall, they rated the Anti-Bias Study Guide a 4.2 on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). General conclusions were:

The Anti-Bias Study Guide offers a comprehensive approach to anti-bias education.
The Guide offers a ""user friendly"" format for teacher's use in the classroom.
The Guide is easily infused into a standards-based curriculum.
The lessons of the Guide are appropriate for all students and can be easily used within a variety of courses.
Comments from the Panelists

Ã¢Â€ÂœI found this Guide extremely easy to follow and understand. Not only were the procedures clearly written and logically organized, but the resource lists, handouts, and discussion questions greatly support appropriate instruction, conceptual depth and student engagement.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœStrengths (of the Guide) include opportunities for students to learn from example and applicationÃ¢Â€Â¦and to move from self to knowledge to action plans.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Study Guide links so directly to the kinds of thinking and work current standards emphasizeÃ¢Â€Â”namely analysis and critical thinking, performance and experiential learning, and integration of multiple disciplines.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Guide is comprehensive in its scope and content. In particular, Units I, II and III draw from real life scenarios adding an authentic flavor to the wide range of teacher and learning strategies.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœStudents (using the Guide) learn about bias conceptually, they think about it personally, they learn how to recognize it in their environments and lives, they study its history, they examine examples of social action, and they engage in planning for initiating social action themselves.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Guide deals with personal values, different perspectives and looking below the surface. These emphases help students understand bias and anti-bias actions as complex and evolving.Ã¢Â€Â

The University of California, Irvine (UCI) has become a center for anti-Semitic activity in recent years. Much of this activity has been organized by the Muslim Student Union (MSU), a vocal student group at UCI, which is responsible for staging large events every spring featuring virulently anti-Semitic speakers.

In July 2010, the MSU was suspended for one year because of its involvement in disrupting a speech by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren in February of that year. Ã‚Â The university's investigation into the matter uncovered evidence that MSU organized a calculated demonstration at Ambassador Oren's speech that was in violation of university policy against disorderly conduct, obstructing university activities, furnishing false information and other campus policies. Eleven studentsÃ¢Â€Â”9 from UCI and 2 UC RiversideÃ¢Â€Â”were arrested at the time. The group was eventually only suspended for the Fall 2010 semester. Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/report/schooled-hate-anti-semitism-campus,"The Issue

The university has traditionally served as an enclave for intellectual expression, insulated from the distractions of the world outside. It has also served as a trendsetter for that outside society, a laboratory where social change first begins to ferment and find an outlet. To a large extent, the excitement and passion on American campuses stem from the combination of scholarly debate and student activism in a sheltered environment.

In recent decades, Jews have generally found the American campus to be a positive environment. Gone are the days of quotas limiting the number of Jewish students at our nation's top colleges and universities. It is now common to find flourishing Jewish life on many campuses, anchored by vibrant Hillel programs and increasingly popular Jewish Studies Departments. Jewish faculty have thrived at many of the nation's top institutions, both as teachers and administrators.

Institutionalized discrimination against Jews is a thing of the past. Jewish students and faculty are found in great numbers at elite universities which once resisted their presence. A majority of Ivy League universities and many others now have or have had Jewish presidents. There are few if any positions in American higher education that are not open to Jewish talent. Therefore, it is paradoxical that the American college and university campus recently emerged as one of the major sites for the expression and dissemination of anti-Semitism.

At hundreds of institutions of higher learning, the concepts of academic freedom and student activism (which have been part of the Jewish success story on campus) have been invoked to shield hatred. No longer the ivory towers they were once considered, colleges and universities are proving all too porous to the prejudices emerging in our society. In recent years, campuses have become a new proving ground for the tactics of all manner of extremists, forcing some colleges and universities onto the frontline in the fight against extremism and anti-Semitism.

Why Campus Anti-Semitism?

The Nation of Islam, or far-right extremists denying the existence of the Holocaust, for example, may not have had their geneses at universities, but their speakers and advertisements have found fertile ground there. As students form their sense of self at college and seek a niche in the world, some are especially vulnerable to hatemongers who either stir their developing political passions or couch bigotry in academic terms designed to appeal to their intellectual curiosity. Controversial speech is often welcomed at universities more than in other venues; students see their campuses as havens of free expression, with the right to speak near sacred.

Racists and demagogues have ably exploited schools' commitment to free speech, cloaking their propaganda in the guise of academic freedom. They have two objectives: hooking the country's future leaders on the ideas they preach, and generating mainstream media coverage through the controversy that inevitably erupts over particularly incendiary events.

Among America's students are many who grew up with little or no contact with Jews and who have a limited personal background to fall back upon when professional anti-Semites come to campus. For instance, young adults with little knowledge of the Holocaust might cast an uncritical look at a campus newspaper advertisement or scholarly-looking text claiming to prove that the murder of 6 million Jews is an historical hoax.

All too eager to prove their commitment to a free exchange of ideas, many students -- and sadly, school administrators as well -- in their idealism and naivetÃƒÂ©, fail to distinguish adequately between debate that enriches and elevates the mind and speech that lowers the level of discourse to name-calling and lies. Many tend to treat all opinions and statements of fact as meriting equal consideration. This mind-set is often encouraged by the current academic vogue of deconstruction and post-modernism, which emphasize relativism and the social construction of ""truth."" The resulting intellectual atmosphere has provided fertile ground for the airing of conspiracy theories, newly invented mythologies and, in some instances, anti-Semitic propositions.

Another factor that has allowed anti-Semitic arguments to proliferate on campuses is the notion that the First Amendment requires their airing. But the Constitution does not oblige universities to host everyone who wants to speak or write there, nor does it require campus newspaper editors to publish every item submitted to them. Campus leaders and journalists have the job of responsibly drawing a line between valid, fact-based opinions and outright bigotry. Moreover, free speech is a two-way street. Students and school administrators have the right and responsibility to condemn and counter hatred. Their failure to do so not only contributes to the spread of hate-filled rhetoric, but causes victimized students to feel defensive, angry and isolated.

Instead of remaining a place where ideas and backgrounds mix harmoniously, or at least contend civilly, many campuses are becoming polarized along ethnic lines and riven by suspicions. The symptoms range from acts of vandalism to hate-filled rallies to ethnic stereotypes that are tolerated in student publications.

While a growing number of university presidents have responded strongly to the importation of bigotry to their campus, many others, regrettably, have not used their platforms to forcefully counter the hatemonger. Some college presidents have issued anemic and generic responses to naked anti-Semitism, using the shield of free expression as an excuse not to condemn extremism at their schools. Responses are often delayed, and then come only as a reaction to pressure from students, alumni, faculty and the surrounding community. Some college heads seem to believe that a response from the president will only fan the flames and keep an unwelcome incident in the public eye.

But just as student groups may exercise their right of free speech by sponsoring a controversial speaker or printing an incendiary opinion, university administrators may exercise their right of free speech by publicly criticizing both the message and the messenger. Criticism is not censorship. The fact that prejudice sometimes comes from a disadvantaged minority group does not give university heads carte blanche to ignore it. Most presidents would presumably want to uphold and elevate the level of debate on their campuses, not protect the racists who would turn the schools into battlefields of name-calling. Leaders must not abdicate their obligation to lead.

Administrators also do a disservice to their students when they hesitate to criticize students' spoken or printed words that eschew the standards of accountability and accuracy applied in most American workplaces. Instead of preparing them for the professional world, where one's work is usually subject to scrutiny and corrective review, these school officials allow students to think that their actions will never have consequences or ramifications beyond the walls of academia.

The hesitancy on the part of certain school heads in responding to anti-Semitism only seems that much more glaring when compared to the positive, timely statements made by some of their peers. University presidents who unequivocally and immediately condemn expressions of bigotry on their campuses send a clear message to students about the line that separates academic freedom from racism.

Washington, D.C., March 20, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â“ The U.S. Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is opening investigations into complaints filed byÃ‚Â The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law andÃ‚Â Anti-Defamation League (ADL) againstÃ‚Â Yale University;Ã‚Â University of Massachusetts Amherst; andÃ‚Â Scripps College. In addition, the Department is opening complaints againstÃ‚Â American University, filed by theÃ‚Â Brandeis Center andÃ‚Â Jewish on Campus (JOC), and theÃ‚Â Fulton County School District filed by theÃ‚Â Brandeis Center and theÃ‚Â National Jewish Advocacy Center (NJAC) for allegations of anti-Semitism against students.

Yale University (Connecticut)

The Yale complaint, filed by the Brandeis Center and ADL, alleges that Jewish and Israeli students have been pushed, obstructed and threatened trying to move about campus. Jewish and Israeli students have been repeatedly harassed in the classroom and elsewhere on campus, precluded from using YaleÃ¢Â€Â™s main library and Yale Law School library, obstructed and prevented from moving freely around campus, and had counterfeit Ã¢Â€ÂœbloodyÃ¢Â€Â hundred-dollar bills that accused Israel of genocide dropped on their heads at the main dining hall. The association of Jews and money has fueled anti-Semitism throughout history. Jewish students have missed numerous classes, meetings, and extracurricular activities. Some hide out in their dorm rooms; others avoid campus altogether. More information can be foundÃ‚Â here.

University of Massachusetts Amherst (Massachusetts)

Per the UMass-Amherst complaint, filed by the Brandeis Center and ADL with the help of Holzman Vogel and Libby Hoopes Brooks & Mulvey law firms, the Department of Education will be investigating a violent and disturbing physical assault where a Jewish student was called a Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist s***bagÃ¢Â€Â and then punched and kicked repeatedly. After initiallyÃ‚Â condemning the attack, the university spent nearly six months ignoring the victimÃ¢Â€Â™s requests to address the matter and hold his attacker accountable. Making matters even worse, the victim was bizarrely subject to a no-contact directive without any basis provided, told he must stay away from members of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), but the SJP members could still approach him, creating a dangerous dynamic. More information on the complaint can be foundÃ‚Â here.

Scripps College (California)

The Scripps complaint, filed by the Brandeis Center, ADL and Arnold & Porter, alleges the university repeatedly abandoned Jewish and Israeli students targeted by anti-Semitic harassment. A student wearing a Star of David was told to remove her Jewish necklace. That student hears anti-Semitic comments two to three times a week, including that Jews are immoral and Ã¢Â€Âœrich and control the media.Ã¢Â€Â Her peers have ostracized her, and she has lost friends for attending weekly Shabbat dinners and studying Torah with the campus rabbi. Multiple articles in the Scripps student newspaper contain shocking examples of anti-Semitic tropes. And the Motley Coffeehouse, the primary location for Scripps students to study together, socialize, and host events, described as the heart of the Scripps College campus, has repeatedly excluded and become an unwelcoming place for Scripps Jewish students. More information on the complaint can be foundÃ‚Â here.

American University (Washington, DC)

The American University complaint, filed by the Brandeis Center and JOC, alleges that AU was fully aware of the pervasive and hostile environment for Jewish students, and not only ignored it, in some cases, it chose to retaliate against Jewish whistleblowers by subjecting them to disciplinary proceedings. The complaint details vandalism, an Israeli student being spat on repeatedly, and Jewish students being harassed, targeted and discriminated against. Swastikas have been drawn on the dorm doors of Jewish students, a Jewish studentÃ¢Â€Â™s recital poster was vandalized with anti-Semitic language and symbols, posters of innocent hostages have been continually torn down without consequence, and Jewish students have been shunned and marginalized in classrooms by peers and faculty.Ã‚Â  More information on the complaint can be foundÃ‚Â here.

Fulton County School District (Georgia)

Filed by the Brandeis Center in conjunction with Jewish Americans for Fairness in Education (JAFE) and NJAC, this Title VI complaint with the OCR against the Fulton County School District (FCSD) was filed over persistent anti-Semitic bullying and harassment against Jewish and Israeli students that took place in elementary, middle, and high schools across the District. The complaint documents numerous incidents showing how FCSD fostered a hostile climate that has allowed anti-Semitism to thrive in its schools at the hands of students, teachers and administrators. FCSD has ignored pleas from Jewish and Israeli parents whose children have faced increasing physical and verbal harassment, and the District has denied the anti-Semitic nature of the incidents. More information on the complaint can be foundÃ‚Â here.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThere has been some concern around what changes to the Department of Education would mean for fighting campus and K-12 anti-Semitism. We are pleased to see the Department continuing to move forward rapidly on Title VI complaints, and in some cases, they are well exceeding historical norms for prompt action,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â said Hon. Kenneth L. Marcus, chairman of the Brandeis Center and the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education who ran OCR during two administrations.Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœWhile the Anti-Semitism Task Force is investigating ten campuses and OCR has warned sixty of them, the federal government has the bandwidth and the will to expand its investigations well past the initial campuses Ã¢Â€Â“ and they are clearly just getting started. These public-private partnerships remain vital.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe welcome the Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s move to open investigations into ADL and the Brandeis CenterÃ¢Â€Â™s joint filings at UMASS Amherst; Yale University; and Scripps College,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â said ADL VP of National Litigation, James Pasch. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe experiences of the Jewish students at these institutions have been emblematic of what we have seen across the country, and that must change, and it must change now. Jewish students being threatened, harassed, and in some instances assaulted, have no place on our campuses, and we hope these investigations will yield positive changes that reverberates on campuses coast-to-coast.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish students deserve equal access to a safe campus environment. American University has failed to provide that, so we took action,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â said Jewish on Campus CEO and Co-Founder Julia Jassey. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe welcome this investigation from the Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s Office for Civil Rights, which we expect to hold the university administration accountable and lead to a safer campus environment for all. We also echo the call from students that with impending changes and restructuring to the Department of Education, the federal government must continue to protect the rights of and access to educational opportunities for students from all protected backgrounds.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are thrilled that the Department of Education has opened an investigation into Fulton County, and we are encouraged that the OCR is not falling for the typical excuses,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â said Mark Goldfeder, CEO of NJAC. Ã¢Â€ÂœThere is a difference between protected political speech and thinly-veiled anti-Semitism, and this case highlights the very real danger of what can happen when perpetrators and administrators alike are allowed to confuse speech with acts and conflate politics with demonizing and discriminatory hatred. God willing the final result will be a safer space for all.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/new-adl-report-finds-evidence-biased-coordinated-campaign-wikipedia-related,"New York, NY, March 18, 2025, Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã‚Â  Through anÃ‚Â extensive investigation, ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society (CTS) researchers found widespread antisemitic and anti-Israel bias on Wikipedia, including clear evidence of a coordinated campaign to manipulate WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s content related toÃ‚Â the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in likely violation of WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s policies.

The report further found that pro-Hamas perspectives inform Arabic-language Wikipedia content on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœMost readers assume Wikipedia is a reliable online encyclopedia, but in reality, it has become a biased platform manipulated by agenda-driven editors on many topics,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœRecent Wikipedia efforts toward neutrality are nothing but a Band-Aid on a problem thatÃ¢Â€Â™s getting worse, with persistent antisemitic and anti-Israel bias still far too present. We urge Wikipedia and policymakers to act quickly before rampant disinformation on one of the most visited sources of information leads to tragic consequences.Ã¢Â€Â

Coordinated anti-Jewish, anti-Israel bias and manipulation

ADL has found clear evidence that a group of at least 30 editors acted in concert to circumvent WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s policies to introduce antisemitic narratives, anti-Israel bias, and misleading information:

These 30 editors were much more active than other comparable groups of editors, on average, by a factor of at least two, based on total edits made over the past 10 years.
The 30 editors were much more likely than other editors to communicate with each other on Wikipedia: they were as much as 18 times more active in group communications than comparable groups of editors.
The editors appeared to coordinate to change pages related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, downplaying Palestinian antisemitism, violence, and calls to destroy Israel while promoting criticism of Israel.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
These edits have ramped up since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and include the systematic removal of citations to reputable sources and tandem voting to keep content critical of Israel but remove coverage of Palestinian violence and terrorism.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœItÃ¢Â€Â™s clear that Wikipedia needs to do far more to address the very active antisemitic and anti-Israel bias and coordination,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â said Daniel Kelley, Interim Head, ADL Center for Technology and Society. Ã¢Â€ÂœAnd until then, other platforms that rely on Wikipedia as a sourceÃ¢Â€Â“ from Google Search to large language models like ChatGPT Ã¢Â€Â“ must deprioritize unvetted WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s content on issues related to Jews, Israel and the Middle East conflict so that they do not perpetuate this bias.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Bias in Arabic-language Wikipedia content on Hamas

In addition to this campaign of anti-Israel manipulation and disinformation found on English-language Wikipedia pages, WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s policies are not adequately preventing widespread bias and partiality on its Arabic-language pages related to Hamas. ADL analyzed pages on the terrorist organization in Arabic and found that both the primary page and related pages glorify Hamas, perpetuate pro-Hamas propaganda, and flout WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s rules for neutrality.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Policy Recommendations

The report provides detailed recommendations for Wikipedia, companies like Google and those with LLMs, and for government, including:

For Wikipedia:

Reputable expert program: Wikipedia should develop a program for experts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, vetted by the Wikimedia Foundation, to review contentious pages for accuracy and bias.
Pre-screening special closure editors: For contentious topics on Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a special committee of administrators should vet and appoint Wikipedia editorsÃ‚Â with the sole right to close talk page discussions concerning disputes about article content.
Closure cannot be decided by a majority vote: Decisions on controversial content that become the subject of talk page discussions should be decided on the merits by specially designated closure editors, rather than by majority vote (as is the current policy but not always actual practice).
Inauthentic behavior/state actors: Wikipedia should evaluate their existing tools against inauthentic behavior and foreign influence to determine whether theyÃ¢Â€Â™re adequate to address current issues and concerns.

For Policymakers:

Convene academics, Wikipedians, computer scientists, and civil society to draw recommendations and policy options for limiting bias and antisemitism on Wikipedia, including pushing for greater transparency and reporting requirements on efforts by Wikipedia to root out bias.
Create a task force aimed at combating antisemitic bias on Wikipedia.Ã‚Â 
Hold hearings on the topic of bias and antisemitism on Wikipedia.
Raise awareness with constituents and colleagues about bias and antisemitism on Wikipedia by writing public letters to the Wikimedia Foundation, highlighting issues and demanding answers on how they will work to ensure the site does not become a haven for hate.

The manipulation and disinformation problem on Wikipedia is wide-spread and touches multiple topics, highlighting the urgency of addressing this broad platform-wide issue.Ã‚Â 

Recently, WikipediaÃ¢Â€Â™s arbitration committee (ArbCom) banned several editors from the Israel-Palestine topic area (known as a topic ban, rather than a more comprehensive site-wide ban). AÃ‚Â World Jewish Congress report on Wikipedia also detailed ongoing issues of anti-Israel and antisemitic bias on English-language Wikipedia, such as Holocaust revisionism. In one instance, a group of Polish editors appears to have engaged inÃ‚Â coordinated efforts to insert a Polish nationalist narrative into articles on the Holocaust in Poland, downplaying Polish responsibility and blaming Polish Jews. Separately, there have also been similarÃ‚Â campaigns to eraseÃ‚Â Native American history.

This research was conducted in partnership with Builders for Tomorrow (BFT), a venture philanthropy and research organization focused on combating anti-Jewish and anti-West ideologies.

This initiative aims to create a united front to reinforce shared values of democracy and human dignity.

Top legislators from five participating countries took part in the ALAS launch event, working collectively to formulate policies and legal frameworks that strengthen the fight against hate and discrimination.

Ã¢Â€ÂœAntisemitism poses a serious threat to democracy and must be confronted with a firm coordinated response across all sectors of society.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/tov-first-ever-jewish-advocacy-etf-tops-100-million-assets-days-after,"NEW YORK, NY, March 11, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â“ The JLens 500 Jewish Advocacy U.S. ETF (NYSE:TOV; the Ã¢Â€ÂœFundÃ¢Â€Â), a groundbreaking exchange-traded fund designed to empower investors to combat antisemitism, support Israel and embody Jewish values, announced today that it has exceeded $100 million in assets, less than two weeks after its launch. The Fund, whose ticker symbol Ã¢Â€ÂœTOVÃ¢Â€Â is the Hebrew word for Ã¢Â€Âœgood,Ã¢Â€Â began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 27, 2025. TOV aims to deliver performance comparable to other U.S. Large Cap index funds while also amplifying the Jewish voice in the corporate arena.

TOV achieved the $100 million milestone partly through the support of several U.S. Jewish organizations, along with the ADL Foundation, who invested seed capital to launch the Fund.

The Fund was sponsored by JLens, a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) and affiliate of ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), to offer investors a way to align their financial goals with Jewish values, while investing in America's largest companies. TOV tracks the JLens 500 Jewish Advocacy U.S. Index, which provides exposure to the 500 largest U.S. public companies. The Fund screens and scores companies based on how their activities align with Jewish values. JLens then uses this information to advocate for Jewish communal interests through engagement with management and boards of directors, proxy voting, and other forms of shareholder advocacy.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe dramatic growth of TOVÃ¢Â€Â™s assets to $100 million Ã¢Â€Â“ in just the short time since its launch Ã¢Â€Â“ clearly demonstrates that investors see the value in having an additional tool to respond to the rising tide of antisemitism and hate. TOV provides a powerful platform for the Jewish community to make its voice heard, and the availability of this new resource to directly confront antisemitism is a vital addition to our mission,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of ADL.

The creation of TOV was inspired by the need for non-traditional tools to combat the dramatic spike in antisemitism following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, particularly the wave of actions against corporations by the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement, and increasing hostility toward Jewish employees in some workplaces.

Ari Hoffnung, Managing Director of JLens, the RIA and non-profit organization serving as the ETFÃ¢Â€Â™s sponsor, noted, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are deeply grateful for the tremendous show of support for TOV. Our Ã¢Â€Â˜own and advocateÃ¢Â€Â™ approach resonates with those who recognize that we can have the greatest impact by engaging directly with companies and encouraging them to champion values that benefit both the Jewish community and society at large.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/letter-american-association-university-professors-over-scholasticide,"Dear President Wolfson, Vice President Lumbantobing, and Council Members,

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Academic Engagement Network (AEN), the American Jewish Committee (AJC), Hillel International and the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) are writing to express our deep concern regarding the American Association of University ProfessorsÃ¢Â€Â™ (AAUP) March 6, 2025, webinar titled ""Scholasticide in Palestine"" which was endorsed by a Council Member and promoted to the full AAUP membership. While we fully support academic freedom, open inquiry, and the right to discuss a range of complex geopolitical issues, we are troubled by the framing of and publicity surrounding this event, which promotes a one-sided narrative demonizing Israel, and perpetuates falsehoods that have no place within a scholarly association.

As organizations that represent faculty nationwide, including longtime AAUP members, and which are fiercely committed to the principle of unfettered academic exchange, we have waited to share our concerns until after the webinar took place so that our correspondence with you would not be misread or misinterpreted as a call to have this misguided event cancelled. Accordingly, we are now writing to you to highlight how we, and many professors with whom we have engaged in recent days about this webinar, feel that this event undermined the work of the AAUP in numerous ways:

Disseminating highly contested information with no opportunity for rebuttal:Ã‚Â The language used in the eventÃ¢Â€Â™s description Ã¢Â€Â“ including Ã¢Â€ÂœscholasticideÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœexterminationistÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â“ suggests the adoption and promotion of a one-sided and inflammatory narrative which deviates from the mission of the AAUP to promote balanced and informed discourse. There is no evidence of any intent by Israel to Ã¢Â€Âœsystemically destroyÃ¢Â€Â the education system in Gaza or elsewhere. The destruction of institutions, including educational ones, is a tragic byproduct of war, exacerbated when terror groups like Hamas embed their operations within school buildings and other civilian centers. Furthermore, the lack of any reference in the eventÃ¢Â€Â™s promotional material to the October 7, 2023 massacre in Israel, the worst instance of the mass murder of Jews on a single day since the Holocaust, which instigated the Israel-Hamas war and all of its attendant destruction, is a serious omission. It ignores the traumas, suffering, and lived experiences of Israelis and others on that horrific day, thereby disrespecting many Jewish members of your organization for whom an attachment to Israel and global Jewry is a core component of their faith identity.
Contributing to the alienation of Jewish members:Ã‚Â With antisemitism already on the rise, such inaccurate, demonizing language as is found in the publicity promoting the March 6 webinar can contribute to a polarized and hostile environment, particularly in academic spaces where tensions are already high. In the last year, many Jewish and Zionist faculty have reported feeling isolated, marginalized, and even targeted within the AAUP and other professional associations and scholarly societies. It is crucial that discussions around such sensitive topics are grounded in factual evidence and presented in a manner that encourages constructive debate and dialogue rather than division.
Deviating from AAUPÃ¢Â€Â™s mission:Ã‚Â The AAUP's admirable mission is to advance academic freedom and define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education. Yet, when AAUP leadership hosts and promotes an event that frames the complex IsraelHamas war in a one-sided manner, the association deviates from this mission by stifling intellectual exchange and critical inquiry. It is essential for academic institutions to foster learning environments where diverse perspectives are explored and debated, rather than promoting partisan orthodoxies and unsubstantiated and contested theories as settled truth. Indeed, the Ã¢Â€ÂœscholasticideÃ¢Â€Â charge has not been subjected to rigorous empirical scrutiny and has been widely challenged, including by prominent scholars who are longtime AAUP members. By endorsing biased events, the AAUP risks undermining its commitment to fostering an inclusive and intellectually rigorous academic community and alienates many members who joined the AAUP based on its stated mission.
Eroding credibility and reputation:Ã‚Â The credibility and reputation of an academic association are built on its ability to support nuanced, principled, and evidence-based discourse. The endorsement of highly contested terms like ""scholasticide"" can erode this credibility, as it suggests a departure from the association's responsibility to uphold rigorous academic standards. Such framing not only risks alienating members of the academic community but also diminishes the association's standing as a reliable and trustworthy source of scholarly dialogue. At a time when many perceive the American academy to be under unfair attacks, professional associationsÃ‚Â  such as the AAUP should appreciate the importance of holding fast to, and uniting membership around, the core and fundamental principles of the academy.Ã‚Â 

We note with dismay that this divisive event is taking place within a wider context of the AAUP being perceived as increasingly moving in a virulently anti-Israel direction, and as a result, growing insensitive and even hostile to the concerns of its Jewish and Zionist members. From accepting the validity of academic boycotts, despite those being in fundamental opposition to academic freedom, to endorsing one-sided events such as the one that took place on March 6, the AAUP has of late departed from its values of promoting open inquiry and unfettered intellectual exchange.

We urge you to consider the broader impact of this event, reassess its polarizing stances, and use this opportunity to reaffirm the associationÃ¢Â€Â™s commitment to its core values and to ensure that it remains a welcoming, inclusive, and intellectually rigorous space for all academics and scholars. Specifically, we call on you to implement the following next steps:

Organize a webinar event featuring scholars, including Israeli and Palestinian academics, who would refute the Ã¢Â€ÂœscholasticideÃ¢Â€Â charge and other claims presented in the March 6 webinar, including the ways in which academic freedom has long been violated on campuses in the West Bank and Gaza by Palestinian governing authorities and societal groups. We urge you to promote and to publicize this online event to the AAUP membership in the same manner as the March 6 event.
Offer professional development opportunities and trainings to AAUP leadership and staff so that they can better understand contemporary antisemitism and the needs and concerns of the associationÃ¢Â€Â™s Jewish and Zionist members.Ã‚Â 
Forcefully and unequivocally condemn the uptick in the shunning, ostracizing, and marginalizing of Israeli academics, a concerning development which has been well documented in recent studies and surveys published in recent months. Notwithstanding the AAUPÃ¢Â€Â™s reversal of its longstanding categorical opposition to the boycott of academic institutions, which we and many other organizations committed to academic freedom and open inquiry have criticized, we hope that your new stance will not prevent you from standing with individual Israeli academics who are now facing severe professional costs as a result of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions).
Facilitate opportunities for AAUP members to share their experiences encountering antisemitism and anti-Israel bias within their disciplines and academic communities. Recent studies, reports, and testimony by faculty across multiple areas of study in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Medical and related fields, highlights a pernicious rise of anti-Jewish hate, harassment, and discrimination. We hope that the AAUP will support the efforts of its members to expose and address this intolerable situation.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â 

We look forward to the possibility of working together to create a more inclusive and informed academic community. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if we can be of further assistance in implementing the next steps that we have highlighted above as critically important and necessary.Ã‚Â  Sincerely,

Among them were married couple Khaled Barakat and Charlotte Kates, leaders of the terror-connected group Samidoun; far-right influencer Jackson Hinkle and his fellow American Communist Party leaders Christopher Helali and Haz Al-Din; and former British academic and anti-Zionist conspiracy theorist David Miller.

The normalization of open and explicit support for terror has been one of the most prominent trends in the international anti-Israel activist space since HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. The in-person attendance of multiple prominent anti-Zionist activists at the Hezbollah funeral and the additional glorification it received from abroad demonstrates the extent to which these concerning pro-terror beliefs have become entrenched in the movement.

A WhoÃ¢Â€Â™s Who of International Anti-Israel Activists on the Ground in Lebanon

Khaled Barakat and Charlotte Kates:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â SpousesÃ‚Â Khaled Barakat and Charlotte Kates are both leaders of Samidoun, an international anti-Israel organization that since October 2024 has been sanctioned by the Canadian government and the U.S. Department of the TreasuryÃ¢Â€Â™s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as a Ã¢Â€Âœsham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for The Popular Front for The Liberation of PalestineÃ¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â (PFLP), a U.S.-designated terror group. Barakat, a Canadian citizen who was born and raised in Jerusalem, is also sanctioned by the U.S. government as a Specially Designated National (SDN) as Ã¢Â€Âœa member of the PFLPÃ¢Â€Â™s leadership.Ã¢Â€Â He is also a leader of Masar Badil, an extreme anti-Zionist international organization that is closely tied to Samidoun.

Ã‚Â 

Barakat appeared on the antisemitic, Iranian state-controlled Press TV network sanctioned by the U.S. government, to speak about his experience at the funeral. HeÃ‚Â praised Nasrallah as Ã¢Â€Âœan exceptional historical leaderÃ¢Â€Â and said Ã¢Â€Âœwe are very lucky that we lived in his timeÃ¢Â€Â¦He represents the project of liberation, the project of people in equality, the liberation of Palestine from the river to the seaÃ¢Â€Â¦He represents that future, that goal, that we all are striving and struggling to see.Ã¢Â€Â

Kates, who was raised in the United States and is now based in Canada with Barakat, posted photographs of herself at the funeral on X. She wrote: Ã¢Â€ÂœIt is such an honor to be here in Beirut today, one among a sea of over a million people in collective tribute, mourning, love and commitment to the road of resistance and liberation exemplified by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hisham Safieddine.Ã¢Â€Â Kates further venerated Nasrallah asÃ‚Â  Ã¢Â€Âœthe great anti-imperialist leader of our day, the great Arab and international revolutionary, the beloved speaker of truth and warrior of justice.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

SamidounÃ¢Â€Â™s main Telegram account also posted about its Ã¢Â€ÂœmembersÃ¢Â€Â participating in the funeral procession, writing that Ã¢Â€Âœthe embrace of the resistance, the depth of its popular cradle, is palpable everywhereÃ¢Â€Â and noting Ã¢Â€Âœthe extremely warm welcome to international participants as people flock from across the region and the world to mourn, honor and continue on the path of the great martyrs of resistance.Ã¢Â€Â

Jackson Hinkle, Christopher Helali and Haz Al-Din: Three of the founding members of the American Communist Party (ACP) Ã¢Â€Â” a group that was formed in 2024 as a breakaway faction of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and which platforms a fringe ideology sometimes referred to as Ã¢Â€ÂœMAGA communismÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” were also in attendance at Nasrallah and SafieddineÃ¢Â€Â™s funeral.

In the days leading up to and during the event, the trio shared numerous posts glorifying Hamas and praising Nasrallah. The ACP X account posted a photograph of the three together at the stadium in Beirut on February 23, noting that they were attending Ã¢Â€Âœthe funeral of the martyred Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah as a show of solidarity to the people of the region from America.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Al-Din wrote on X that attending the funeral was a Ã¢Â€Âœgreat honorÃ¢Â€Â and claimed Ã¢Â€ÂœHezbollah arenÃ¢Â€Â™t terrorists.Ã¢Â€Â Al-Din also echoed classic antisemitic tropes in denouncing Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist scum,Ã¢Â€Â stating, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t able to parasitically leech off our own country, America, the Zionist p*ssies [sic] would be nothing.Ã¢Â€Â He added, Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Zionist media wants you to believe all these people are terrorists. Nasrallah's funeral was a reflection of the soul of an entire people.Ã¢Â€Â

Hinkle, Helali and Al-DinÃ¢Â€Â™s support for Hezbollah is unsurprising, as their attendance at the funeral was not the ACPÃ¢Â€Â™s first foray into making direct contact with terrorists. In the past six months, Hinkle and Helali also traveled to Doha, Qatar, to interview Hamas leaders.

In August 2024, Helali Ã¢Â€Â” a local elected official in Orange County, VT, and a high school social studies teacher in nearby Hanover, NH Ã¢Â€Â” interviewed senior Hamas officials Basem Naim and Osama Hamdan, both sanctioned by the U.S. government for activities conducted on behalf of the terrorist group. Hinkle, a far-right influencer and commentator, then interviewed Naim again in Doha in mid-February 2025, days before the Beirut funeral. Hinkle lavished Naim and Hamas with praise, ending the interviewÃ‚Â by saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou have my full support and the support of many Americans, the tide is shifting, and we just love you guys.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Hinkle in particular has gained prominence on social media Ã¢Â€Â” accumulating more than two million new followers on X in the six months after the October 7 Hamas attack Ã¢Â€Â” by sharingÃ‚Â extensive anti-Israel and anti-Zionist rhetoric, including explicit pro-terror content and false, antisemitic narratives. Hinkle previously interviewed a leader of the antisemitic U.S.-designated terror group the Houthis (AKA Ansar Allah)Ã‚Â  remotely in October 2024.

Traveling to Qatar and Lebanon to meet with Hamas and Hezbollah representatives was a notable escalation in the brazenness of Hinkle and his associatesÃ¢Â€Â™ activities. It is unclear at this time how these trips were funded.

David Miller:Ã‚Â British anti-Zionist and discredited academic David Miller, who in 2021 was fired from his position as a political sociology professor at the UKÃ¢Â€Â™s University of Bristol over antisemitism allegations, was also on the ground in Beirut the week of the funeral. On February 22, 2025, Miller participated in a roundtable discussion with other international anti-Zionists recorded in Lebanon for the Free Palestine TV program Ã¢Â€ÂœWartime Cafe.Ã¢Â€Â

Moderated by Canadian anti-Zionist and Free Palestine TV founder Laith Marouf, Miller Ã¢Â€Â” alongside Canadian lawyer and activist Dimitri Lascaris; Iranian-American professor at the University of Tehran, Mohammad Marandi; and Lebanon-based journalist Leila Hatoum Ã¢Â€Â” discussed the upcoming funeral and their plans to attend. Marouf and Lascaris were among those who also assembled at the site of the funeral the day before it took place, as well.

Ã‚Â 

On the day of the funeral, Miller posted his account of the funeral on X, describing the masses of people waving Hezbollah flags and related paraphernalia as, Ã¢Â€ÂœA tide of humanity. Yellow flags fluttering in the sun.Ã¢Â€Â After returning to the UK, Miller shared further details about his trip to Lebanon on an episode of Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestine Declassified,Ã¢Â€Â an antisemitic video series produced by Press TV for which Miller serves as a producer and lead presenter. Marouf also appeared remotely on the same Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestine DeclassifiedÃ¢Â€Â episode.

Additional Praise for Nasrallah from Activists Abroad

Anti-Zionist activists outside of Lebanon also made their support for Hezbollah, Nasrallah and Safieddine known in response to the funeral. A few dozen anti-Israel activists in New York, led by the anti-Israel groups Bronx Anti-War Coalition and Misandry Committee, held a Ã¢Â€ÂœvigilÃ¢Â€Â in Washington Square Park on February 23, 2025, to memorialize the two terror group leaders.

Protesters displayed Hezbollah flags and photographs of Nasrallah and Safieddine and chanted antisemitic and pro-terror slogans, including Ã¢Â€ÂœWe don't want no Zionists here,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœStrike, strike Tel AvivÃ¢Â€Â (in Arabic) and Ã¢Â€ÂœKhaybar, Khaybar, oh Jews, the army of Mohammed will returnÃ¢Â€Â (also in Arabic; an antisemitic chant which references a battle fought in 628 CE in which Jews were massacred).

Ã‚Â 

The veneration of Nasrallah and Safieddine by American anti-Israel activists follows a similar pattern of responses over the past year and a half. Activists engaged in similar activities following the initial news of NasrallahÃ¢Â€Â™s death in the fall of 2024, as well as after the deaths of Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar.

Calla Walsh Ã¢Â€Â” an anti-Israel activist who recently served jail time after being convicted of vandalizing a New Hampshire facility belonging to the Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems Ã¢Â€Â” participated in the New York vigil for Nasrallah and expressed her admiration for him on social media.

Numerous other anti-Israel activists also praised Nasrallah and Safieddine online. Lamis Deek, a New York-based leader of the anti-Zionist group Al-Awda, shared a video of the funeral on X and described it as Ã¢Â€Âœthe most epic farewell.Ã¢Â€Â

Anti-Zionist activist and author Susan Abulhawa also shared footage of the funeral in a post on X in which she placed Nasrallah in a category of praiseworthy Ã¢Â€ÂœleadersÃ¢Â€Â¦who dedicate their lives in service of othersÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœwho inspire and give us hope.Ã¢Â€Â She contrasted this statement with a denunciation of various other world leaders whom she condemned as Ã¢Â€Âœmass murder[ers],Ã¢Â€Â including Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu (referring to him by the antisemitic moniker Ã¢Â€ÂœBenjamin Meilekowski (Satanyahu),Ã¢Â€Â a reference to his familyÃ¢Â€Â™s original Polish surname that was changed before NetanyahuÃ¢Â€Â™s birth).

The most recent outpouring of support for Nasrallah and Safieddine underscores how self-described Ã¢Â€Âœanti-IsraelÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœanti-ZionistÃ¢Â€Â activism can frequently veer into outright support for terror and antisemitism.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/federal-antisemitism-complaints-filed-against-three-california-schools,"Brandeis Center, ADL, StandWithUs, Jewish on Campus Allege California Schools Willfully Ignored Severe Anti-Semitic Harassment & Intimidation, Urge Feds to Intervene

Ã‚Â 

Washington, D.C., March 6, 2025Ã¢Â€Â¦ Leading Jewish organizations, today, announced they have filed three federal complaints with the U.S. Department of Education againstÃ‚Â California State Polytechnic,Ã‚Â Scripps College, and CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â Etiwanda School District alleging the schools are in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Cal Poly

According to theÃ‚Â complaint filed today against California State Polytechnic (Cal Poly), Humboldt by the Brandeis Center and Jewish on Campus, Jewish students have been attacked verbally and physically, excluded and forced out of areas on campus, and subjected to vicious anti-Semitism. Anti-Israel campus protestors have thrown fake blood on Jewish students; spray painted anti-Semitic graffiti; shouted anti-Semitic slurs at Jewish students; vandalized campus property, including frightening acts of violence like shattering glass doors; and harassed Jewish students celebrating a Jewish holiday by shouting anti-Semitic invectives at them through a megaphone, glorifying Hamas and chalking inflammatory anti-Semitic messages.

Instead of addressing the anti-Semitism, Cal PolyÃ¢Â€Â™s administration has encouraged Jewish students to hide their Jewish identity to avoid being targeted. In one instance, a Cal Poly student approached the Chabad, a Jewish student group that was tabling at a club fair. He began shouting that the Jewish students were baby killers, genocide supporters and land stealers. The student grabbed items off the table and blocked other students from approaching the table with his intimidating rhetoric and by placing his body in front of the table.Ã‚Â  The perpetrator also inserted himself physically between the rabbi and students who were engaged in discussion, blocking their conversations.Ã‚Â  Instead of addressing the anti-Semitic incident, the Associate Dean for Student Life told the Jewish students that they should pack up and leave the fair. In another instance, a ritual item was stolen from Jewish students and, instead of addressing the anti-Semitic act, the administration told the Jewish students they should take additional steps to avoid further theft.Ã‚Â  These are just two examples of many where the university encouraged Jewish students to keep their heads down and retreat. According to the complaint, Ã¢Â€Âœ[t]he message from the University to Jewish students is clear: downplay your Jewish identity on campus or hide to avoid being targeted because the University will not protect you.Ã¢Â€Â Jewish students report fearing for their safety and being denied opportunities.Ã‚Â  Some have left campus.

Scripps College

The ScrippsÃ‚Â complaint, filed recently by the Brandeis Center, ADL and Arnold & Porter, alleges Scripps repeatedly abandoned Jewish and Israeli students targeted by anti-Semitic harassment. A student wearing a Star of David was told to remove her Jewish necklace.Ã‚Â  That student hears anti-Semitic comments two to three times a week, including that Jews are immoral and Ã¢Â€Âœrich and control the media.Ã¢Â€Â Her peers have ostracized her, and she has lost friends for attending weekly Shabbat dinners and studying Torah with the campus rabbi. Multiple articles in the Scripps student newspaper contain shocking examples of anti-Semitic tropes. And the Motley Coffeehouse, the primary location for Scripps students to study together, socialize, and host events, described as the heart of the Scripps College campus, has repeatedly discriminated against and become an unwelcoming place for Scripps Jewish students.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

The Motley staff were overheard boasting that they refused to hire a Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist.Ã¢Â€Â Its student employees complained they did not want to associate with Ã¢Â€Âœcrazy Zionists.Ã¢Â€Â The coffeehouse has been plastered with anti-Israel flyers and the Motley staff hung a Palestinian flag on its walls, yet they refused to hang an Israeli flag. Requests to host Jewish events at the Motley were ignored or rejected, while anti-Israel student organizations were permitted to hold weekly meetings. The Motley refused to allow its space to be used for a vigil to honor the victims of October 7, yet it closed for an entire day in memory of a Hezbollah terrorist. Ã¢Â€Âœ[R]ich Jewish donorsÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistsÃ¢Â€Â were blamed when the Scripps Administration closed the Motley. Scripps failed to correct this blatantly false information, and anti-Semitic tropes spread like wildfire across campus. Ã‚Â 

While Pomona College,Ã‚Â another member of the Claremont College Consortium, banned Scripps students who vandalized buildings and disrupted classes during a demonstration venerating the October 7 Hamas attacks, and referred those students to Scripps for disciplinary action, Scripps bent over backward to ensure PomonaÃ¢Â€Â™s bans would have as limited an impact on them as possible. According to the complaint, Ã¢Â€ÂœScrippsÃ¢Â€Â™s failure to condemn and disciplineÃ¢Â€Â”coupled with its active scrambling to support the anti-Semitic protestersÃ¢Â€Â”sends a message of support for the purveyors of anti-Semitism.Ã¢Â€Â As one Jewish student stated: Ã¢Â€ÂœI felt like maybe itÃ¢Â€Â™s best if I donÃ¢Â€Â™t engage with my Judaism here, so I donÃ¢Â€Â™t feel ostracized.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Jewish students have transferred from Scripps and chosen to study abroad or graduate early to escape the hostile environment. One Jewish student who stayed at Scripps noted she learned to hide her Jewish identity and suppress her views. In her words: Ã¢Â€ÂœI stopped wearing anything that would identify me as a Jew. I regret not transferring to a school that takes the concerns of Jewish students seriously.Ã¢Â€Â

Etiwanda

The EtiwandaÃ‚Â complaint, also filed today by the Brandeis Center, ADL and StandWithUs, involves a 12-year-old girl who was subjected to repeated anti-Semitic bullying, harassment, and discrimination that continued to escalate due to inaction from the school. Outdoors on school grounds, a student struck her repeatedly with a stick and then with her bare hands. When the Jewish student called out for help, she was told to Ã¢Â€Âœshut [her] stupid Jewish ass up.Ã¢Â€Â She was then pinned against a table and choked for several seconds, until she escaped, red-faced and coughing. Subsequent harassment based on her Jewish identity went on to occur in her classroom. She was humiliated and marginalized by a different peer and told, Ã¢Â€ÂœThis wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be an issue if you werenÃ¢Â€Â™t Jewish.Ã¢Â€Â She was then bullied by yet another student who purposefully harassed and taunted her with a Hitler joke.Ã‚Â  The bullying took place over several weeks and in public in front of the girlÃ¢Â€Â™s peers.Ã‚Â  The school was aware of the incidents but failed to discipline the offenders or take steps to preventÃ‚Â further targeting. This is the first complaint brought through the Brandeis, ADL, StandWithUsÃ‚Â K-12 helpline, a pro-bono service open to parents and students.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœWhile an increasing number ofÃ‚Â  schools recognize that their Jewish students are being targeted both for their religious beliefs and due to their ancestral connection to Israel, and are taking necessary steps to address both classic and contemporary forms of anti-Semitism, some shamefully continue to turn a blind eye,Ã¢Â€Â stated Brandeis Center Chairman Kenneth L. Marcus, a civil rights expert appointed by Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump to run the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education.Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœThe law and federal government recognize Jews share a common faith and they are a people with a shared history and heritage rooted in the land of Israel. Schools that continue to ignore either aspect of Jewish identity are becoming dangerous breeding grounds for escalating anti-Jewish bigotry, and they must be held accountable.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœADL and our partners will not sit idly by as Jewish students are attacked for their identity Ã¢Â€Â“ from our college campuses to our K-12 schools, our educational institutions have an obligation to protect their Jewish students and ensure that all its students receive an education free of harassment and discrimination, said James Pasch, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Vice President of National Litigation. Ã¢Â€ÂœStudents and parents continue to reach out to ADL, Brandeis and StandWithUs through our expanded K-12 helpline, and we will continue to use administrative filings and the courts to ensure the safety of all Jewish students.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

""Too many of our nation's young minds are being corrupted by the disease of antisemitism. It is the duty of K-12 educators and administrators to provide the necessary education to inoculate themÃ¢Â€Â”not indoctrinate them,"" said Roz Rothstein, CEO and co-founder of StandWithUs. ""As long as students continue to find themselves on the receiving end of anti-Jewish hate and bigotry from their peers or teachers, and their appeals to administration continue to fall on deaf ears, we will continue to show up and support them in holding their schools accountable.""

Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish students deserve consistent support from their university administrators, not calls to hide their Jewish identity,Ã¢Â€Â said Jewish on Campus CEO Julia Jassey. Ã¢Â€ÂœOn campuses across the country, Jewish students have faced an unprecedented rise of antisemitism since the October 7th massacre, including at Cal Poly. We urge a swift investigation and a campus climate where no student has to endure such intimidation.Ã¢Â€Â

The Brandeis Center, ADL and StandWithUs, along with the American Jewish Committee, recently prevented the Santa Ana Unified School District from teaching ethnic studies courses developed in secret and infected with anti-Semitism.Ã‚Â 

Harvard University, in response to aÃ‚Â lawsuit filed by the Brandeis Center, recently tookÃ‚Â significant measures to protect its Jewish students from contemporary anti-Semitism.Ã‚Â  The university will apply the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism with its examples to its non-discrimination and anti-bullying policies, recognize the centrality of Zionism to Jewish identity, and explicitly state that targeting Jews and Zionists constitutes a violation of school rules. OtherÃ‚Â schools have also settled recent complaints with similar concrete action.

The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law is an independent, unaffiliated, nonprofit corporation established to advance the civil and human rights of the Jewish people and promote justice for all. LDB engages in research, education, and legal advocacy to combat the resurgence of anti-Semitism on college and university campuses, in the workplace, and elsewhere.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/picture-and-chapter-books-celebrate-jewish-american-heritage-month,"Jewish American Heritage Month takes place every year in May. Similar to other themed months focused on communities of people, it is important to acknowledge and teach about Jewish people, identity and culture throughout the school year and not just isolate that learning to May. At the same time, Jewish American Heritage Month is a time to uplift and provide learning experiences for students to explore the Jewish experience. ChildrenÃ¢Â€Â™s books, both picture books and chapter books, are a useful opening to introduce elementary students to the Jewish experience. This can include an exploration of holidays, traditions, culture, history, notable people, antisemitism faced by the Jewish community and more. Using books to learn about Jewish people will enhance studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ understanding of our diverse society and world.Ã‚Â

Delivered: March 4, 2025Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

(As delivered)

Thank you! Thank you for this incredible recognition, and an enormous thank you to the ADL. Jonathan, thank you so much for your kind words.

As we all know, hatred, intolerance and bigotry are on the rise. Most of us will never have experienced a worse time for antisemitism in our lifetimes.

But we should feel safer knowing that the ADL has our backs. So thank you ADL for the work you do for all of us.

My name is GalÃ¢Â€Â¦I am a mother, a wife, a sister, a daughter, an actress, I am an Israeli - and I am Jewish.

IÃ¢Â€Â™ll say it again. My name is Gal. And IÃ¢Â€Â™m Jewish.

IsnÃ¢Â€Â™t it crazy that just saying that, just expressing such a simple fact about who I am feels like a controversial statement? But sadly, this is where weÃ¢Â€Â™re at today.

I grew up in Rosh HaAyin in the center of Israel. My mother was the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. Her father, my grandfather, Abraham Weiss, may he rest in peace, was born in what was then Czechoslovakia. He was the only one of his family who survived. His father died fighting for the Czech army when the Nazis invaded. His mother and brother were murdered in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. He came to Israel with nothing and built a life for himself, and despite the horrors he endured, he always taught me the values of love, compassion and tolerance. Ã¢Â€ÂœYou donÃ¢Â€Â™t win anything with anger and hateÃ¢Â€Â he used to tell me.

On my fatherÃ¢Â€Â™s side, I am the eighth generation to be born in the Land of Israel. One of my ancestors was the very first chemist at the Shaare Zedek hospital in Jerusalem.

IÃ¢Â€Â™m very proud of both sides of my family and they show two sides of Israel. On the one hand, a country that provided a life-raft for refugees fleeing the horrors of persecution, pogroms and the Holocaust. On the other hand, the historic homeland of the Jewish people, where our roots run deep and where we are an indigenous people.

I am proud to be Israeli and I am proud to be Jewish.

But this is a time when many of us in the Jewish community have had to find our voice, and confront the hatred against us even if itÃ¢Â€Â™s extremely uncomfortable. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s been the case for all of us, in every walk of life, and every profession - including my own.Ã‚Â 

IÃ¢Â€Â™d never really wanted to talk about politics. I kind of tried really hard to avoid it, because no one wants to hear celebrities going on and on about political issues, right?

But also, I always regarded myself as a citizen of the world, an equal among equals. IÃ¢Â€Â™m Israeli, of course, and I knew that antisemitism and anti-Israel hate existed. And like all of us, sometimes IÃ¢Â€Â™d caught a whiff of it. But I never thought of myself as beingÃ‚Â where I came from. It was an aspect of who I am but it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t define me.Ã‚Â 

And then October 7 happened, and everything since.

Never did I imagine that we would witness such a day of such death and destruction of Jews in our lifetime. And never did I imagine that on the streets of the United States, and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating, justifying and cheering on a massacre of Jews.

I know IÃ¢Â€Â™m not the only one in this room when I say that it was a wakeup call.

And hereÃ¢Â€Â™s the thing Ã¢Â€Â“ however much you tried to avoid it before, even if speaking up wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t really your thing, none of us can ignore the explosion of Jew-hatred around the world anymore.

And that is what I am doing. No AI needed. It really is me, standing in front of you today, saying, simply, that my name is Gal, and I am Jewish. And we have had enough of Jew-hatred.

We will confront antisemitism. We will call it out. But we will never let it, not only defeat us, but define us, because our love is stronger than their hate.

In the days after October 7 we were all distraught. Like many of you, I was glued to the horrors coming out of Israel and the hatred spilling over here. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not a religiously observant person. But I found myself in Temple Ã¢Â€Â“ in the synagogue. And it was then that I was comforted. I felt the embrace of the Jewish people and the power and the warmth of our community.

And I will never forget that feeling. Because even though I was a long way from Israel in a Temple in Los Angeles, I felt at home, like I was among family. And for those few precious moments, the chaos and violence of the outside world felt just a little easier to deal with.

October 7 showed us that what happens to Jews anywhere affects Jews everywhere. And this goes both ways. Not only what happens there affects us here, what we do here affects them there.

So we are here, together calling for the release of every single one of our hostages. We have to bring them home!

With every hostage release we hear new testimonies of the horror they have been through. Every minute for them is hell. Their lives are in danger. We need them home.

We want the hostages and their families to know, that we have your back, and that we are here for you. I want you to know, that wherever you go in the world where there is a Jewish community, you will find people who campaigned for you, who love you and who will always be there for you.

Because this is who we are and who we will always be: taking responsibility for each other.

Along with my husband Yaron, IÃ¢Â€Â™m bringing up four daughters to also be proud of who they are: to take responsibility, to love themselves and to love others. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re raising strong independent Jewish women.Ã‚Â Strong women who stand with other women.

I know that many women in this room and in our community, have always stood strong for the rights of women and girls. On October 7th, Jewish women were sexually terrorized, murdered, raped and kidnapped by Hamas. We were all listening out, hoping to hear support from our sisters around the world, and too often heard silence.

We canÃ¢Â€Â™t wait any longer. We canÃ¢Â€Â™t hold our breaths, pray or beg for support from people groups or communities that donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to be there for us. We need to be there for ourselves.

And this is why every single Jew must lean in now, in whatever way we can. Speak up. Learn more about our history Ã¢Â€Â“ we can always do that. Join a temple. Find your tribe, get connected. And as we support our own community, never stop reaching out to the world.

Rabbi Hillel famously said:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã—ÂÃ—Â Ã—ÂÃ—Â™Ã—ÂŸ Ã—ÂÃ—Â Ã—Â™ Ã—ÂœÃ—Â™ Ã—ÂžÃ—Â™ Ã—ÂœÃ—Â™Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Âœif I am not for myself then who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, then what am I? So even if we donÃ¢Â€Â™t hear others speaking up for us, we have to keep speaking up for ourselves and reaching out our hand for everyone to join us.

That is what I tell my daughters. First, learn to love yourselves, who you are and where youÃ¢Â€Â™re from and then the rest will follow. It is time to pass onto our children a love of who they are.

So who are we? We, the Jewish people, are an ancient people, with an ancient story in an ancient homeland. We are the people that celebrate live. We work to see a better and more peaceful future.Ã‚Â  We challenge the hate we face but we do it with love, while always striving to make the world a better place.

And who am I? My name is Gal. And I am Jewish.

Am Yisrael Chai.

Thank you!","[1, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH

The summit, which took place at the Javits Center in New York City on March 3-4, drew more than 4,000 attendees, including global leaders, activists, students, policymakers, and business executives.

Gadot was recognized for her fearless and outspoken advocacy against antisemitism and hate, as well as her unwavering support for Israel and Jewish communities worldwide. In the wake of the October 7th terrorist attacks, she used her platform to amplify the voices of survivors, call for the release of hostages, and hold global institutions accountable for addressing violence against Israeli women. Her efforts included hosting a groundbreaking private screening to reveal the realities of the attacks and urging international leadersÃ¢Â€Â”including the United Nations and major womenÃ¢Â€Â™s rights organizationsÃ¢Â€Â”to demand justice.

""A hero both on screen and off, Gal Gadot has been an unshakable force in the fight against antisemitism,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of ADL.

In implementing this partnership, the two organizations will work together on multiple initiatives, starting with surveys of faculty networks to replicate ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s efforts surveying students on campuses; toolkits and best practice guides for leaders and members of academic and professional associations; and the development of a staff network for Jewish and Zionist staff members on campus.

Thank you. Thank you all for coming here today.

It feels as if a lifetime has elapsed since we last convened a year ago. Then, we were reeling from the horrors and pain of October 7th and its aftermath.

Now, a year later. We find ourselves in a different world.

First and foremost, many of the hostages Ã¢Â€Â“ thank, God -- have come home, including many these past few weeks.

Like you, nothing made me happier than to see those families hug their loved ones. I can watch those videos all day.

And let me just say: we cannot rest until every single one of them -- the living and the deceased -- are back in Israel. Bring them home now.Ã‚Â 

Another thing thatÃ¢Â€Â™s different: after months of allowing the harassment, intimidation, and even violence against Jewish students and faculty, many university presidents, certainly not all, but many have rediscovered the virtues of actually enforcing their policies on encampments and harassment.

And now- Ã‚Â a new administration has taken office in Washington and made it abundantly clear that it will redouble the federal governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s efforts to fight antisemitism on campus, in K-12 schools, and in international organizations. And you know, regardless of who you voted for, this is something to celebrate and support.

As we convene here today, Sinwar and Nasrallah no longer walk the Earth.

Assad is in exile.

The Islamic Republic of Iran -- the world's largest state-sponsor of antisemitism and terror -- is in retreat, and its proxies are shells of what they once were.

So maybe, just maybe, we are turning the cornerÃ¢Â€Â¦coming out of one of the darkest periods in Jewish history since the end of World War II.

But to think that everything can go back to normal is a fantasy.

We still have right-wing extremists Ã¢Â€Â“ freed from prison and emboldened in the United StatesÃ¢Â€Â¦and their compatriots organizing and mobilizing in political parties across Europe.Ã‚Â 

Beyond our shores, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember a time when Diaspora communities faced more uncertainty. We are seeing waves of violence in once-safe places like Sydney and Toronto. Synagogues torched, homes defaced, cars vandalized Ã¢Â€Â“ this is the new norm for Jews in so many liberal democracies.

College campuses in US may not be aflame, but not a single day goes by without ADL getting a call about a student who was harassed or attacked, or about a campus group that wants to glorify Hamas terroristsÃ¢Â€Â¦kick Hillel off campusÃ¢Â€Â¦or force their university to adopt BDS.

We still have self-described Ã¢Â€ÂœprogressivesÃ¢Â€Â -- in major non-profits, professional associations, news outlets, and in elected office --- who see themselves as the Ã¢Â€Âœparity police,Ã¢Â€Â refusing to acknowledge anti-Jewish hate on its own and gaslighting us about what is or is not antisemitic.

Suffice to say, all of us at ADL are still very, very busy.

Because, no matter where you stand, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s no going back. The ground beneath us has profoundly shifted since 10/7.

We are in a new era.

One author went so far as to argue that the Ã¢Â€Âœgolden ageÃ¢Â€Â of American Jewry is over.Ã‚Â 

A distinguished historian noted that for the first time since 1948, Jewish Americans are now feeling something our ancestors in Poland, Germany, Tunisia, Iraq, or wherever they lived knew far too well: fear.

Fear.

Many of us are old enough to remember when our grandparents would lower their voices when talking about Jewish things in publicÃ¢Â€Â¦I remember being to behave so as not to bring shame on the JewsÃ¢Â€Â¦Others actually changed their names to something more Ã¢Â€Âœacceptable.Ã¢Â€Â

That was done out of fear.

And over the years its true, these old behaviors faded away -- they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t necessary. They seemed as outdated as plastic covering the living room couches or rotary phones.

But let me ask you, as you're sitting here today:

How many of you have changed vacation plans in the past year? Maybe decided not to travel to London or Paris? Or if you did, you probably took off your Star of David necklace or thought twice before visiting a Jewish site.

How many of us have children looking at colleges and find ourselves crossing off the list amazing, world-class universities -- places that many of us attended or wish we could have Ã¢Â€Â“ because of their antisemitism?

How many of our synagogues and JCCs now have bulletproof glass, metal detectors, and armed security?

Let me ask you: do the churches in your town or YMCAs have take these precautions?

IÃ¢Â€Â™m willing to bet: not one.

How many of you have changed your account names on Uber or DoorDash so they don't sound Jewish.Ã‚Â 

Or removed a mezuzah from your front door?

That, my friends, is the return of fear.

Check the date. Regardless of what your calendar might say, today is October 8th -- and we live in a very different world.

Here in the US, the percentage of Americans with Ã¢Â€ÂœsignificantÃ¢Â€Â or ""elevated"" antisemitic attitudes jumped last year to 24 percent, more than double the 2019 figure and the highest level weÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen since 1964.

And for the first time since we started doing these analyses , the younger generation is now notably more antisemitic than the older generation. That is an ominous sign if there ever was one.

Unsurprisingly, the number of anti-Jewish incidents in the US has reached record levels in four of the past five years. And in the 12 months after 10/7, there were more thanÃ‚Â 10,000 antisemitic incidents in America; thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the highest number ADL has ever recorded in any single 12-month period since we started tracking such data in the 1970s.

Or again, on college campuses, more than 83 percent of Jewish students have witnessed or experienced antisemitism since 10/7.

1 in 4 actually have taken extra security measures to protect themselves.

Here. In America.Ã‚Â 

If fear is back, we know why.

It is shocking.

It is unreal.

And it is unacceptable.

And so, in the face of this very real fearÃ¢Â€Â¦we must do better.

We canÃ¢Â€Â™t keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. As the old saying goes, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the very definition of insanity.

And at ADL and at all organizations, we must identify what works and what doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t deliver results, fix what has fallen short, stop doing what flat-out doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t work, and constantly, relentlessly, ruthlessly innovate.

We canÃ¢Â€Â™t rest on our laurels. We simply canÃ¢Â€Â™t keep doing something because itÃ¢Â€Â™s tradition or because some donor likes it.Ã‚Â 

Hard times force us to make hard choices.

And that's exactly what weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing at ADL.

When I stood before you a year ago, I said we would pivot. I said that a new world requires new strategies and new approaches to fight antisemitism -- and that is whatÃ¢Â€Â™s happening at ADL.

Let me give you some specific examples.

First, in a world where it is increasingly acceptable to be antisemitic, condemnation is not enough.

Because when there is no moral shame, you canÃ¢Â€Â™t just scold someone into action.Ã‚Â 

But data doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t lie.Ã‚Â 

Data is what drives change.

So, last year, we launched an annual campus report card to document and judge college campuses on how they treat their Jewish community. We developed a rigorous rubric and gave out grades from A to F -- something these academic institutions definitely understand.

We hoped that bad grades would prod these colleges and universities into action, and eventually everyone would get an A -- not because of grade inflation, but because they were able to see how they were failing -- and ideally they would want to fix it.

In the past year since we published the first report card, ADL offices across the country engaged, on a sustained basis, with 70 percent of the schools we rated.Ã‚Â 

We provided concrete recommendations on new policies and gave hands-on advice to administrators. I myself spoke to dozens of university presidents one-on-one, giving them counsel and criticism, pushing them to do better.

And today, I am proud to announce we just released our second annual report card, and IÃ¢Â€Â™m delighted to share that more than one-third of the schools we assessed in 2024 improved by one-whole letter grade.

Ten percent jumped two grades.

You can check it out yourself. Go toÃ‚Â  ADL.org/CampusReportCard Ã¢Â€Â“ to see all the grades, but after do it after this session, if you don't mind.

Seeing how this approach is working, ADL has launched the Ratings and Assessment Institute to apply this same model of rigorous, data-based evaluations to new sectors, such as: state governments, public companies, and professional associations.

We will hold them all accountable.

Second example of our pivot, we are going to court.

Ã‚Â ADL has filed more lawsuits in the last 12 months than we had done in our first 112 years of existence.

These actions include litigation against extremist groups, universities, school districts, corporations and aÃ‚Â landmark $4 billion lawsuit that we filed, on behalf of American victims of 10/7, against Iran for the Islamic RepublicÃ¢Â€Â™s role in facilitating the attack.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

And let me tell you, we are going to win.

We also realized that it was too difficult for people to get the legal help they needed. So we partnered with our friends at the Brandeis Center, Hillel International, the law firm Gibson Dunn and numerous other white shoe firms toÃ‚Â create and set up CALL, a first-of-its-kind legal hotline for students and staff at colleges and universities who have been victimized by antisemitism, but previously did not know where to go.

In less than 18 months, the CALL system has handled more than 800 individual Title VI complaints. Ã‚Â 

And IÃ¢Â€Â™m happy to report that, based on its success, we have begun to expand CALL to handle cases of discrimination against students, parents, and teachers in K-12 school districts where the issues also are rampant and virtually unmonitored.

Third example of our pivot, we are moving upstream to interrupt antisemitism before it even happens.

The ADL Center on Antisemitism Research quietly has matured into a world-class center of excellence in social science, conducting a wide range of research from highly targeted focus groups to large-scale surveys to randomized control trials, all focused on practical issues such as how we improve the efficacy of our programs or how we interrupt intolerance before it takes root.

Their insights now inform everything we do at ADL from our Instagram feed to our educational curricula.

Fourth example of our pivot, we are finding new ways to harness our power.

Many companies are now targeted by BDS campaigns that seek to demonize Israel and create hostile workplaces for Jewish employees.

Last year alone, 75 percent of the Fortune 500 were targeted by BDS efforts.Ã‚Â 

ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why JLens, a subsidiary of ADL, launched the first-ever Jewish exchange-traded fund or ETF just last week.

It started trading this past Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange -- with the ticker of Ã¢Â€ÂœTOVÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â“ the Hebrew word for good.

ItÃ¢Â€Â™s the first Jewish ETF in the world and, beyond the financial benefits, TOV will unlock the latent power of shareholder advocacy in a way that the Jewish community has never tapped.

So, when the BDS hooligans try to schedule a die-in at a shareholdersÃ¢Â€Â™ meetings or to propose some preposterous resolution to force a company to divest from Israel, TOV will give us a seat at the table so we can punch back.

And believe me, we will.

Finally, ADL doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t just innovate in a lab, we show up and step right into the ring.

Hours after the horrific pogrom against Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam late last year, I was there on the ground in that cityÃ¢Â€Â¦having a one-on-one with the Dutch Prime Minister in his residence, telling him that he must take action to protect his Jewish citizens.

Showing up is what ADL does, day in and day out, in your cities and towns across America and around the world.Ã‚Â 

Take what happened last summer, when our Center on Extremism learned that there would be far-right, extremist demonstrations in Nashville, Tennessee.

Our Atlanta office took that intel, alerted local law enforcement and elected leaders in Nashville that these groups planned to march and disturb city council meetings. We gave them the details, we shared with them the specifics, so they could stop it from happening, and we also helped prepare them for any eventuality.

And we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t stop there.

We also provided model ordinances to the Nashville City Council that would help that city combat these groups.

And guess what happened? They passed new laws, and now Nashville is a safer and more inclusive city using the ADL modeled legislation.Ã‚Â 

Or look at what happened in Chicago, Illinois last year.Ã‚Â 

A group of anti-Israel therapists took it upon themselves to compile a Facebook list of Zionists, targeting mental health professionals simply for the offense of being Jewish or supporting the Jewish state, threatening their livelihoods and reputations.

This wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just an attack on individuals; it was an attack on the integrity of an entire profession. And we werenÃ¢Â€Â™t going to let that stand.

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Incident Response Team leapt into action, working with our Center for Technology and Society to press Meta to have the group removed for violating platform policies around doxxing.

But this wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just about shutting down a Facebook page Ã¢Â€Â” it was about real accountability.

So we engaged directly with Illinois state regulators, pushing them to sanction the therapists behind the page, who initiated the campaign, including stripping them of theirÃ‚Â licenses.

We are tracking the outcome closely, but a message has been sent and delivered -- and now, others will think twice before they target the Jewish community.

You see, this is what ADL does. Sometimes out in front, sometimes behind the scenes, but always, always, always being true to our core purpose: to protect the Jewish people.

Look at some of last yearÃ¢Â€Â™s numbers, our score board, if you will:

Our analysts provided law enforcement with more than 2,700 assists to law enforcement, actionable intelligence that helped police to prevent crimes and protect endangered communities.
Our Synagogues in Action program reached more than 150,000 households through more than 450 synagogues in 45 states plus DC and Canada.
And ADL's educational materials reached more than five million schoolchildren across America.

I know and I appreciate it, that a lot of attention gets paid to our statements and many of you might not agree with every position we take or every item we post.

And you know, that's just fine, because we donÃ¢Â€Â™t just tweet about bigots. We take them on and take their bigotry apart, piece by piece.Ã‚Â 

And so, I know, I feel the fear that's out there. We all wish we could turn back the clock to October 6.

But, when I think about this past year, yes there is fear, but there is hope.

Hope in the ordinary Americans who know itÃ¢Â€Â™s wrong to vandalize synagogues and to harass their Jewish neighborsÃ¢Â€Â¦

Hope in the silenced majority, many of whom have never even met a Jew, but know itÃ¢Â€Â™s wrong to attack students on campus or seniors walking to worship.

And so I know there is hope.Ã‚Â 

And while we are inspired by this hope, I also acknowledge that hope is not a strategy.

That is why we at ADL will not cede a single inch to the antisemitesÃ¢Â€Â¦

We will not stop finding new ways to prevent bigotry Ã¢Â€Â“ and stop the bigots in their tracksÃ¢Â€Â¦.

And we will never relent in fighting for our community with everything we've got.Ã‚Â 

For our kidsÃ¢Â€Â¦

For our futureÃ¢Â€Â¦

because never is now.

Thank you. Thank you.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/anti-defamation-league-honors-farah-pandith-2025-daniel-pearl-award,"New York, NY Ã¢Â€Â“ March 2, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â“ Today ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) honored Farah Pandith, former diplomat and world-renowned foreign policy strategist, with the prestigious Daniel Pearl Award at the 2025 National Leadership Summit. Pandith, whose work in countering violent extremism has garnered global recognition, was honored for her significant contributions to promoting peace, understanding, and resilience against hatred and intolerance.

The ADL Daniel Pearl Award was established in 2004 by longtime ADL leaders George and Ruth Moss and their son, Richard, following the horrific murder of Wall Street JournalÃ‚Â reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002 at the hands of antisemitic terrorists in Pakistan. The award honors his memory and commitment through his work to build cultural bridges and promote understanding.

Pandith, the first-ever Special Representative to Muslim Communities under Secretaries Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, has spent decades in public service, including as a senior advisor at the ADL. Her role as a thought leader in the fight against violent extremism has been integral to U.S. and global policy. As the author of How We Win, she highlights the importance of entrepreneurial, political, and social innovations in overcoming the threats of extremism.

As a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, Pandith is widely recognized for her expertise in creating impactful solutions to complex global issues. Her work has had a lasting impact on policy and society, as she works to unify communities and dismantle extremist ideologies.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are thrilled to honor Farah Pandith with the 2025 Daniel Pearl Award,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœHer valiant efforts in fighting extremism, promoting peace, and advocating for the dignity of all people have made her an invaluable force for good. Farah's work is a testament to the importance of leadership and empathy in the face of hatred.Ã¢Â€Â

PandithÃ¢Â€Â™s leadership extends far beyond her work in government. She was named the first-ever Muhammad Ali Global Peace Laureate in 2020, a fitting acknowledgment of her dedication to promoting humanitarian values and fostering compassion. Her leadership on the Department of Homeland SecurityÃ¢Â€Â™s Advisory Council and her role in founding the Ali Index on Compassion further exemplify her commitment to creating a more peaceful world.

Ã¢Â€ÂœIt is truly an honor to present the Daniel Pearl Award to Farah Pandith,Ã¢Â€Â said Richard Moss, ADL Board Member. Ã¢Â€ÂœFarahÃ¢Â€Â™s devotion to countering violent extremism, fostering dialogue, and promoting peace embodies the spirit of Daniel PearlÃ¢Â€Â™s legacy. Her leadership is a reminder that we all have the power to make a meaningful difference in the world.Ã¢Â€Â

PandithÃ¢Â€Â™s extraordinary achievements, both in the public and private sectors, continue to inspire individuals worldwide to take action against bigotry and violence. Her tireless efforts and advocacy for a more inclusive global community make her a deserving recipient of the Daniel Pearl Award.

Previous recipients of the ADL Daniel Pearl Award includeÃ‚Â Nuseir Yassin, Israeli-Palestinian content creator; Imam Abdullah Antepli, scholar and interfaith leader; Mohammed Al Samawi, Yemeni refugee and author; The Aladdin Project; journalist Henrique Cymerman; Spanish journalist Pilar Rahola; Rabbi Harold M.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-honors-judge-carlos-mahiques-bold-ruling-irans-role-amia-bombings,"New York, New York, March 2, 2025 ... Today ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) honored Argentinian Judge Carlos A. Mahiques with the ADL Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation Award at the 2025 National Leadership Summit.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Judge Mahiques received this honor for authoring the majority opinion in the landmark ruling by the Argentinian Court of Cassation on March 11, 2024. This decision boldly confronted the cover-up by Argentinian officials related to the 1994 AMIA Jewish community center bombing in Buenos Aires, which claimed 85 lives and injured hundreds more. The ruling also reaffirmed longstanding accusations against Iranian officials, specifically implicating high-ranking Iranian government members and Hezbollah operatives in orchestrating the attack.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Judge Mahiques leveraged legal mechanisms to secure accountability and justice, shedding light on the crucial role that courts play in countering terrorism, alongside military, intelligence, and policy efforts. His decision underscored the involvement of Iranian officials and Hezbollah operatives, urging Argentinian authorities to collaborate with international entities, to bring these perpetrators to justice. This ruling marks a pivotal step in the ongoing 30-year quest for accountability and parallels the enduring pursuit of justice for Leon Klinghoffer, murdered 40 years ago by Palestinian terrorists on the Achille Lauro cruise ship.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ilsa and Lisa Klinghoffer, co-founders of the Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation of the Anti-Defamation League, said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are honored to present this year's Klinghoffer Award to Judge Carlos Mahiques for his landmark ruling on the AMIA bombing. This is the first time we are recognizing an individual who has used the judiciary to combat terrorism. Especially now, 40 years after our father, Leon Klinghoffer, was brutally murdered by Palestinian terrorists aboard the Achille Lauro cruise ship, we commend Judge Mahiques for his relentless pursuit of justice and unwavering commitment to holding those responsible for the horrific AMIA bombing accountable.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The award was presented by ADL Senior Vice President of International Affairs, Amb. Marina Rosenberg, who commended Judge Mahiques for his unwavering dedication to justice and his significant contribution to global efforts against terrorism. ""While there is still a long path until justice is fully served to the AMIA bombing victims, Judge MahiquesÃ¢Â€Â™s ruling on an issue that has been repeatedly covered up and ignored, is an important and courageous step forward, and speaks to the need for courts to hold terrorists and their supporters fully accountable,"" said Marina. ""For his courage, integrity and unwavering commitment to justice, it is my honor and privilege to present Judge Carlos Mahiques with the 2025 Klinghoffer Award.""Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

In his acceptance speech, Judge Mahiques stated, ""The terrorist attack against AMIA was a tragedy for Argentina and for the worldÃ¢Â€Â”a turning point in understanding radical Islamist terrorism and its method of extreme violence. Terrorism is not merely a security or legal issue; it is primarily a political one; which, as a judge, I analyze like an archaeologistÃ¢Â€Â”tracing its remnants and reconstructing its original design. In such an endeavor, we cannot afford errors."" He concluded by saying, 'Receiving the 2025 Klinghoffer Award is both humbling and an immense honor.'""Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Established in 1987, the ADL Klinghoffer Award celebrates individuals who have made outstanding contributions toward combating antisemitism and securing justice. Past recipients include Stuart A. Levey, the 9/11 Commission, and Former Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Richard Schifter.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Judge MahiquesÃ¢Â€Â™ legacy, epitomized by this significant ruling, serves as a beacon of hope and a reminder of the persistent need for legal avenues in the fight against antisemitism and terrorism.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/some-schools-improved-protecting-jewish-students-while-many-still-failing,"New York, NY, March 3, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â” ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) gaveÃ‚Â 36 percent of schools an A or B in itsÃ‚Â 2025 Campus Antisemitism Report Card,Ã‚Â up from 23.5 percent in 2024. TheÃ‚Â updatedÃ‚Â evaluation of how U.S. colleges and universities are addressing antisemitism assessed 135 schoolsÃ¢Â€Â”50 more than last yearÃ¢Â€Â”using 30 evaluation criteria to assign letter grades from A to F.

Additional Key Findings:Ã‚Â 

21 percent of schools received a D, and 9.6 percent received an F.
Ã‚Â 
45 percent of previously graded schools improved, while only 9 percent declined.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Notable changes:Ã‚Â CUNY Queens College, Georgetown University, Harvard University, Michigan State University, SUNY Purchase College, SUNY Rockland Community College, Tufts University, University of Michigan, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Vanderbilt University all moved up two grades.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Top-performing schools (A Grades): Brandeis University, CUNY Queens College, CUNY Brooklyn College, Elon University, Florida International University, University of Alabama, University of Miami and Vanderbilt University.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Failing schools (F Grades): California Polytechnic State University, DePaul University, Evergreen State College, Haverford College, Loyola University New Orleans, Pitzer College, Pomona College, Portland State University, Scripps College, The New School, University of California Santa Barbara, University of Illinois Chicago and University of Minnesota.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœI said it last year and IÃ¢Â€Â™ll say it again: every single campus should get an Ã¢Â€Â˜AÃ¢Â€Â™, this isnÃ¢Â€Â™t a high bar Ã¢Â€Â“ this should be the standard,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœWhile many campuses have improved in ways that are encouraging and commendable, Jewish students still do not feel safe or included on too many campuses. The progress weÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen is evidence that change is possible Ã¢Â€Â“ all university leaders should focus on addressing these very real challenges with real action.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Why Are Some Schools Improving?Ã‚Â 

More than 50 percent of the schools assessed in 2024 have enacted major policy changes in response to rising campus antisemitism; almost all have revised their demonstration policies.

Universities that strengthen and consistently enforce policies, mandate antisemitism education, and improve bias reporting have seen the most progress.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe improvement on campus is largely due to new administrative initiatives implemented in response to the campus antisemitism crisis,Ã¢Â€Â said Shira Goodman, ADL VP of Advocacy. Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™re glad that improving the campus climate for Jewish students was a priority for many of these schools, and we hope all colleges and universities understand the importance of developing and enforcing strong policies and procedures to create a safe and welcoming environment for Jewish students and all students.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

A recent ADL survey conducted with partners found 83 percent of Jewish college students experienced or witnessed antisemitism since the Oct. 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, and thatÃ‚Â 66 percent of Jewish students were not confident in their universityÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to prevent antisemitic incidents.Ã‚Â 

New Features & ResourcesÃ‚Â 

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2025 Campus Antisemitism Report Card not only assesses campuses, it also provides tools to empower stakeholders and hold universities accountable.Ã‚Â 

Expanded School Evaluations Ã¢Â€Â“ This yearÃ¢Â€Â™s report covers 135 schools, up from 85 in 2024, expanding the analysis to more institutions with significant Jewish student populationsÃ‚Â as well as schools of particular concern and those viewed as exemplary in combating antisemitism.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Enhanced Evaluation Criteria Ã¢Â€Â“ The 30-point grading system categorizes schoolsÃ¢Â€Â™ responses into three critical areas:
Ã‚Â 
Administrative Action & Policies Ã¢Â€Â“ Examines institutional responses and policy changes.
Ã‚Â 
Campus Conduct & Climate Concerns Ã¢Â€Â“ Measures the prevalence of antisemitic incidents, protests, and anti-Zionist groups on campus.
Ã‚Â 
Jewish Life on Campus Ã¢Â€Â“ Assesses the support, inclusion, and safety of JewishÃ‚Â members of the campus community through campus organizations and cultural engagement.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Qualitative Analysis Ã¢Â€Â“ Beyond hard metrics, the 2025 Report Card incorporates qualitative assessments, evaluating how well universities enforce policies, engage Jewish communities, and respond to real-world incidentsÃ¢Â€Â”capturing factors that raw data alone might miss.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Not On My Campus Campaign Ã¢Â€Â“ The Report Card is a key part of ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s work urging colleges and universities to commit to no tolerance for antisemitism. Launched in response to the surge in antisemitic incidents after October 7, 2023, this campaign provides:
Ã‚Â 
Digital advocacy tools to help students, parents, and alumni pressure school leadership to take action.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Policy recommendationsÃ‚Â and best practices to guide universities in strengthening their efforts to combat antisemitism.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
A framework for ongoing accountability, ensuring that institutions remain under scrutiny beyond the reportÃ¢Â€Â™s release.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/farrakhans-influence-and-absence-mark-nation-islams-annual-conference,"The Nation of Islam (NOI) held its annual SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day conference in Chicago, IL, from February 21Ã¢Â€Â“23, 2025. In a marked departure from over forty years of tradition, longtime NOI leader Louis Farrakhan, 91, was mostly absent from the weekendÃ¢Â€Â™s activities, which were also smaller in scale than usual.

Nonetheless, Farrakhan and NOIÃ¢Â€Â™s familiar brand of conspiratorial and antisemitic rhetoric Ã¢Â€Â” including some of the same claims that Farrakhan made during his 2024 SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day address about Israel and HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7 terrorist attack Ã¢Â€Â” reverberated in the messages shared by his followers.

Breaking from SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day Traditions

SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day (originally spelled SaviourÃ¢Â€Â™s Day) was first established during the tenure of former NOI leader Elijah Muhammad to commemorate the birth of NOI founder W. Fard Muhammad and reflect on his teachings. Following Elijah MuhammadÃ¢Â€Â™s death, Farrakhan took over the leadership of the NOI and revived the SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day tradition beginning in 1981.

SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day serves as one of the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s most significant annual platforms to promote its hateful ideology. FarrakhanÃ¢Â€Â™s SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day addresses routinely contain extensive and wide-ranging antisemitism, including characterizing Jews as satanic liars, making claims about alleged Jewish power and control, promoting conspiratorial allegations about the Holocaust and 9/11, and more.

SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day, which has grown over the years to include multiple days of programming ahead of the traditional Sunday keynote address, has historically drawn upwards of 40,000 attendees and received national news coverage. In recent years, however, the scale has diminished to some extent.

After decades of hosting the conference at large arenas or convention centers, the NOI instead held a mostly virtual SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day for the first time in 2021 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to 2025, 2021 was also the only other SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day at which Farrakhan chose to hand off the primary keynote address duties to Student National Assistant Minister Ishmael Muhammad, though Farrakhan did still speak for more than an hour after MuhammadÃ¢Â€Â™s remarks concluded. After another semi-virtual conference led by Farrakhan in 2022, SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day returned to an arena setting in 2023 (at Wintrust Arena in Chicago) and 2024 (at Huntington Place in Detroit).

This year, the combination of venue and keynote speaker lent SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day a decidedly diminished profile. The NOI hosted the weekendÃ¢Â€Â™s events at its Mosque Maryam and National Center headquarters in Chicago, after reportedly failing to secure a larger, offsite venue. Ishmael Muhammad was again tapped to deliver the address, but this time without any supplementary remarks by Farrakhan himself. Farrakhan did speak briefly during a closed session in front of NOI members earlier in the weekend and greeted conference attendees, but did not appear to be in the room during the keynote session.

Louis Farrakhan made an appearance during the private graduation ceremony of the NOIÃ¢Â€Â™s Fruit of Islam (FOI) and Muslim Girls Training and General Civilization Class (MGT and GCC) as part of SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day weekend on Saturday, February 22, 2025 but did not appear at the public keynote address on Sunday, February 23. (Screenshot/X)

Ã‚Â 

Familiar Rhetoric in the Keynote Address

The keynote address that Ishmael Muhammad delivered on behalf of Farrakhan was titled Ã¢Â€ÂœRepent, For the Kingdom of God Is at Hand,Ã¢Â€Â and featured familiar NOI talking points about the alleged imminent fall of America and the world, pointing to unusual weather events as Ã¢Â€Âœevidence.Ã¢Â€Â

Muhammad also appealed directly to President Donald Trump, saying ""Death is what approaches and God wants you, Mr. President, to listen. You are in the position to help America escape the wrath of God."" Muhammad added, ""Trump is the last president to receive the offer of God, the plea of God, to repent. Because itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to get terrible.""

Muhammad also spoke about IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s imminent destruction, repeating many of the same antisemitic and conspiratorial claims that Farrakhan made in his 2024 SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day address. This included the accusation that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had advance knowledge of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, but that Netanyahu allowed it to happen to have a ""pretext"" to force Palestinians out of Gaza, annex land throughout the region and form a ""Greater Israel.""

Muhammad stated: Ã¢Â€ÂœNetanyahu [and] his military commandersÃ¢Â€Â¦They knew Hamas was gonna attackÃ¢Â€Â¦And they were willing to sacrifice their own people for their greedy gain.Ã¢Â€Â He alleged that Netanyahu is Ã¢Â€Âœin jeopardy of reaping the total destructionÃ¢Â€Â of Israel and its people. Muhammad also repeated the familiar NOI defense of Farrakhan against longstanding antisemitism accusations.

Notable SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day attendees recognized during MuhammadÃ¢Â€Â™s speech included longtime Farrakhan allies Father Michael Pfleger, Bishop Frank Reid and Yosef Asiel (son of the late Prince Asiel Ben Israel). In addition to the overflowing crowd on the grounds of the NOI headquarters, more than 15,000 viewers tuned in to the keynote address across livestreams on the NOIÃ¢Â€Â™s website and platforms that included X, Rumble, Odysee and Twitch.

Looking Ahead to the NOIÃ¢Â€Â™s Future

Commenting on FarrakhanÃ¢Â€Â™s absence on Sunday, Ishmael Muhammad reassured followers that Farrakhan is not ""on a death watch,"" but acknowledged that the group is looking to a future Ã¢Â€Âœwith the Minister [Farrakhan] not being here physically.Ã¢Â€Â Muhammad reflected, Ã¢Â€Âœthis is one of the greatest signs of perhaps how we will be, and how we should be. Even if [FarrakhanÃ¢Â€Â™s] not here with us, we will continue to stand. We will continue to work the work of our Lord and Saviour.Ã¢Â€Â

Farrakhan and the NOI have indicated at various times over the years that the longtime leader would be stepping back from his public role as the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s leader Ã¢Â€Â” including in 2007, 2016 and 2022 Ã¢Â€Â” but each time, he has reemerged to speak again at the next SavioursÃ¢Â€Â™ Day or during other NOI events.","[2, 4, 5, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.9, 6: 0.6}",HIGH

Ã‚Â 

February 27, 2025 -- San Francisco -- ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff LLP (Benesch) today filed a federal lawsuit against the operators of Jerusalem Coffee House of Oakland Calif., on behalf of a Jewish customer, Michael Radice, alleging the cafe violated his civil rights and denied him full and equal accommodations by refusing him service simply for being Jewish. This marks the first case ADL has filed to halt discriminatory business practices by establishments refusing to serve Jewish customers.Ã‚Â 

The Complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges Jerusalem Coffee House violated Mr. RadiceÃ¢Â€Â™s civil rights under both federal and California law.

Ã¢Â€ÂœNo one should have to hide who they are to order a cup of coffee, but at Jerusalem Coffee House, antisemitism was literally on the menu,Ã¢Â€Â said Marc Levine, Regional Director for ADL Central Pacific. Ã¢Â€ÂœBigotry against Jews is on the rise, but we will not be turned away Ã¢Â€Â“ this behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere.Ã¢Â€Â

Mr. Radice, who runs a local nonprofit, visited Jerusalem Coffee House twice and was subjected to antisemitic harassment both times. The first time, in July 2024, he wore a baseball cap with a Star of David icon and the phrase Ã¢Â€ÂœAm Yisrael ChaiÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” or Ã¢Â€Âœthe people of Israel liveÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” emblazoned on the cap in Hebrew. A man sitting outside demanded, Ã¢Â€ÂœAre you a Jew?Ã¢Â€Â After Mr. Radice answered affirmatively, the man then spewed a series of claims about the Israel-Hamas war and loudly accused Mr. Radice of being Ã¢Â€ÂœresponsibleÃ¢Â€Â for Ã¢Â€Âœkilling children.Ã¢Â€Â As Mr. Radice, concerned for his safety, turned to walk away, he noticed the coffee shop owner talking with the man.

Believing that the coffee shop owner had intervened on his behalf, Mr. Radice returned the following month to make a purchase at the cafÃƒÂ©. When he entered the coffee shop, however, he discovered the man who harassed him in July was working there, along with the owner and a third employee. According to the Complaint, instead of being able to make a purchase, Mr. Radice found himself being ejected by all three employees as they yelled, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™re the guy with the hat. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re the Jew. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re the Zionist. We donÃ¢Â€Â™t want you in our coffee shop. Get out.Ã¢Â€Â As Mr. Radice walked away, three men followed him, and he heard them calling him Ã¢Â€ÂœJewÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m proud to be Jewish, and I was stunned to experience such overt discrimination,Ã¢Â€Â said Mr. Radice. Ã¢Â€ÂœI donÃ¢Â€Â™t want any other Jews to have to experience such bigotry at Jerusalem Coffee House or at any establishment. This lawsuit is about accountability and sending a clear message that antisemitism is unacceptable.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are proud to work with the ADL to rid the community of discrimination,Ã¢Â€Â added Benesch Partner Michael Meuti. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe took on this case pro bono because not only is it illegal to refuse service to anybody because of their religion or ethnicity, itÃ¢Â€Â™s simply not ok.Ã¢Â€Â

Jerusalem Coffee HouseÃ¢Â€Â™s behavior toward Mr. Radice was part of a pattern of antisemitic discrimination. Around the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks, the cafe introducedÃ‚Â new menu items seemingly celebrating the murder of Jewish people, including drinks called Ã¢Â€ÂœIced In Tea FadaÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœSweet Sinwar,Ã¢Â€Â with Hamas symbols decorating the menu. The owner was also videotaped ejecting a Jewish man and his child while proudly declaring that he could refuse to serve customers simply because they are Jewish.

Ã¢Â€ÂœNobody deserves to be discriminated against simply for being who they are, and Benesch will stand up for anyone who is,Ã¢Â€Â said Benesch Senior Managing Associate Dave Hopkins.

The Complaint urges the court to declare that the defendants violated Mr. RadiceÃ¢Â€Â™s civil rights and award him damages.

This action is the latest in ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s expanded effort to fight antisemitism and extremism through the legal system. The organization filed more lawsuits in a 12-month period than in its first 111 years of existence, including litigation against corporations, extremist groups, universities, school districts, and state sponsors of terror.

Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is Ã¢Â€Âœto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.Ã¢Â€Â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/jlens-launches-first-ever-jewish-advocacy-etf-tov-nyse-backed-adl,"NEW YORK, NY, February 27, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â“ TheÃ‚Â JLens 500 Jewish Advocacy U.S. ETF (NYSE:TOV), a groundbreaking exchange-traded fund that aims to empower investors to combat antisemitism, support Israel and embody Jewish values, is set to begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol Ã¢Â€ÂœTOVÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â“ the Hebrew word for Ã¢Â€ÂœgoodÃ¢Â€Â.

Created by JLens,Ã‚Â an affiliate ofÃ‚Â ADL (the Anti-Defamation League),Ã‚Â TOV offers investors a way to align their financial goals with Jewish values while investing in America's largest companies. Several U.S. Jewish organizations, along with the ADL Foundation, have committed to invest over $100 million in seed capital to launch the new Fund. The supporting organizations include the Atlanta Jewish Foundation, Goodman Family Foundation, Jewish Community Partners (Memphis), Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, Libitzky Family Foundation, and Newton and Rochelle Becker Charitable Trust.

TOV tracks the JLens 500 Jewish Advocacy U.S. Index, which provides exposure to the 500 largest U.S. public companies and screens out companies whose activities do not align with Jewish values.Ã‚Â  The remaining companies are then assessed based on their performance on Jewish values scorecards. JLens uses this information to advocate for Jewish communal interests through engagement with management and boards of directors, proxy voting, and other forms of shareholder advocacy. The Fund aims to deliver performance comparable to other US Large Cap index funds and amplify the Jewish voice in the corporate arena.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe launch of TOV reflects the need for a strong, deliberate and innovative response to the unprecedented spike in antisemitism following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of ADL. Ã¢Â€ÂœIn the aftermath of this event, we have seen a wave of actions against corporations by the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement, as well as more Jewish employees finding themselves in hostile workplaces, which demands a robust response.Ã¢Â€Â

According to ADL, there haveÃ‚Â been more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in the year following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. This is the highest number of incidents ever recorded in any 12-month period since ADL started tracking in 1979. In addition, many leading U.S. companies have been targeted by campaigns associated with the BDS movement, which has used shareholder proposals and other tactics to pressure corporations to suspend or withhold economic interaction with Israel. According to JLens research, more than 75 of the 500 largest U.S. public corporations were targeted by the BDS movement in the past year.

Ã¢Â€ÂœFor over 100 years, ADL has pursued a mission to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all. New challenges call for new tools and strategies, and thanks to JLens the TOV will allow us to stand up to hate using a wide array of shareholder advocacy tools,Ã¢Â€Â Mr. Greenblatt added.

Ã¢Â€ÂœGiven their profound influence on societyÃ¢Â€Â”now rivaling that of governmentsÃ¢Â€Â”corporations have an obligation to ensure their products, platforms, and workplaces remain free from antisemitism and all forms of hate,Ã¢Â€Â noted Ari Hoffnung, Managing Director of JLens, the non-profit organization serving as the ETFÃ¢Â€Â™s sponsor. Ã¢Â€ÂœTOV provides a new investment vehicle for the Jewish community to hold corporations accountable, while also giving investors and shareholders the ability to Ã¢Â€Â˜invest JewishlyÃ¢Â€Â™.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are proud to be among the first investors in TOV, which provides the Atlanta Jewish communityÃ¢Â€Â“and all those across the U.S. who share Jewish valuesÃ¢Â€Â“with a new tool to stand up against antisemitism and anti-Israel bias,Ã¢Â€Â stated Lindsay Kopecky, Chief Advancement Officer of the Atlanta Jewish Foundation.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are proud to bring this innovative investment strategy to the Memphis Jewish community and the Jewish Foundation of Memphis investment platform,Ã¢Â€Â said Charles Jalenak, Investment Chair, Jewish Community Partners. Ã¢Â€ÂœBy investing philanthropic funds in TOV, our donors are provided an effective tool to take meaningful action against antisemitism and support Israel.Ã¢Â€Â

""As one of the first institutional investors in TOV, we're proud to align our endowment with the Jewish values that TOV represents,"" said Peter Chiswick, Director, JUF Investments, Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/houthis-long-tradition-antisemitism-and-anti-israel-hate,"On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump designated the Houthis (also called Ã¢Â€ÂœAnsar AllahÃ¢Â€Â), the Islamic Republic of IranÃ¢Â€Â™s terror proxy in Yemen, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). This adds to their previous designation under the Biden administration as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT). Together, the FTO and SDGT designations allow the US Government to target the Houthis more effectively.

The Houthis have been launching missile and drone attacks against Israel in direct alliance with Hamas since October 19, 2023. Since then, they have regularly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea, leading to a drop in overall Suez Canal traffic of at least 50 percent, and the case of dry-bulk, up to 80 percent. US and Royal Navy vessels sent to protect international shipping and help intercept Houthi missile attacks on Israel have also come under attack. In fact, the USÃ‚Â  NavyÃ¢Â€Â™s activities against the Houthis now count as the most intense US Naval running sea battle since World War II.

For the most part, Israel and its allies have been able to intercept many of these attacks, such as the ballistic missile destroyed in mid-air by Israeli defense systems on September 28, 2024. Tragically, however, some Houthi attacks have found their mark. For example, on July 19, 2024, the Houthis launched a drone attack on Tel Aviv which killed 50-year-old Yevgeny Ferder and wounded 10 others.

In response, the Israeli Air Force has bombed the Yemeni port of Hodeida on multiple occasions, including on July 21, 2024, and September 29, 2024. The port is used to receive long-range weapons smuggled from the Iranian regime. Indeed, the drone that killed Ferder was an adapted Iranian-made Samad-3 drone, which the Houthis renamed a Ã¢Â€ÂœJaffaÃ¢Â€Â drone. IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s retaliations led to further threats from the Houthis and other Iranian-regime proxies of continued attacks against Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Nasser Kanaani called IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s retaliations Ã¢Â€Âœcriminal actsÃ¢Â€Â which would not go Ã¢Â€Âœunanswered.Ã¢Â€Â

This has led to open support for the Houthis by some demonstrators on American and European streets.

Mobilizing Around October 7, 2023:

On October 7, the Houthis immediately began relaying press releases from Hamas on their website, beginning with a statement from Mohammed Deif, then chief of staff of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ Qassam Brigades, announcing the start of the October 7 massacre. The statement included a call to Ã¢Â€Âœthe Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and YemenÃ¢Â€Â to join in the attack.

For almost a year after October 7, the official Houthi website had a permanent headline banner featuring images of Hamas spokesmen and Israeli soldiers murdered during the initial Hamas incursion into Israel.

On October 19, 2023, the Houthis began their first direct attack against Israeli cities by launching a barrage of missiles and drones at Israeli territory. In January 2024, footage emerged of Houthi militias conducting an October-7-style attack drill, using images of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Star of David.

In an address in December 2023, Abdel Malik al-Houthi stated that Ã¢Â€Âœthe thing we want most, the thing we have been wishing for from day-one is for the war between us and the Americans and Israelis to be a direct confrontation.Ã¢Â€Â

Since then, the Houthis have claimed responsibility for numerous attacks against Israel. They have also become a significant threat to shipping in the Red Sea, attacking international cargo ships with the intention of causing economic harm to Israel and limiting IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s access to rearmaments. This is what protestors in the West are referencing when they chant, Ã¢Â€ÂœYemen, Yemen, make us proud; turn another ship around!Ã¢Â€Â

In line with their desire for direct confrontation with the United States, the Houthis have also attacked more than 50 US naval vessels in the Red Sea, leading US military officials to characterize the situation as the Ã¢Â€Âœthe most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II.Ã¢Â€Â

The HouthisÃ¢Â€Â™ enthusiasm for attacking Israel has earned them prestige from Iran and its regional proxies. The Houthi attacks were praised by the former leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, in every one of his public addresses following October 7, 2023. On November 3, 2023, Nasrallah stated his hope that the Houthi missiles and drones:

Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â¦will reach Eilat and the south [of Israel], and the occupying Israeli bases in the south [of Israel] and they [the Houthis] have all our respectÃ¢Â€Â.

In an address on January 5th, Nasrallah again praised the Houthi attacks for forcing Israel to:

Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â¦redirect part of its air defenses, Iron Dome, and Patriot missiles from the north and south of [Israel] to the Eilat region. This had the effect of making [Eilat] also insecure, which means more displacement and eviction of Israelis from the Gaza Strip border areas. This helps exert more pressure on the enemy government.Ã¢Â€Â

Hamas has also directly praised the Houthis, publishing a letter on September 16, 2024 in which Yahya Sinwar congratulated Abdul Malik al-Houthi for his Ã¢Â€Âœsuccess in reaching the depth of the enemy entityÃ¢Â€Â with missile and drone attacks. Sinwar went on to reiterate HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ unity with other Iranian proxies, stating Ã¢Â€Âœour efforts, along with the resistance in Yemen, Lebanon, and Iraq, will defeat the enemy.Ã¢Â€Â

The Houthis therefore see themselves Ã¢Â€Â“ and are seen by other Iranian proxies Ã¢Â€Â“ as part of a concerted effort to destroy Israel and America, an aim that has been embedded in the Houthi ideology since the 1990s. October 7, 2023 and its aftermath have simply given the Houthis a pretext to act out their ideology, and thereby both consolidate their hold on Yemen and garner greater trust and patronage from Iran.

Who are the Houthis?

The Houthi attacks on Israel are motivated by a deep and intense hatred of Jews that predates the Gaza conflict by decades.

Indeed, antisemitism and violent antipathy towards Israel are central to the Houthi identity, and in large part are a product of both ideological influence and material support from the Islamic Republic of Iran which have shaped the movement over the years.

The Houthis, or Ã¢Â€ÂœAnsar AllahÃ¢Â€Â (Supporters of God), belong to the minority Zaydi sect of Shia Islam. The Houthi movement began in the 1990s as a Zaydi-Shia religious and political reaction to what was seen as an encroachment into Yemen by Saudi Arabian-educated clerics spreading Sunni Salafism.

Both Hussein al-Houthi Ã¢Â€Â“ after whom the movement is named Ã¢Â€Â“ and his brother, and current leader of the movement, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, studied in Qom in Iran. Abdul Malik also spent time in Hezbollah-controlled Southern Lebanon in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As a result, while the Houthis remain Zaydi in their faith, their movement took on the broader political outlook of the Khomeinist ideology that defines the regional and global aims of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its primary regional proxy, Hezbollah.

The political influence of Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran helped establish antisemitism and anti-Americanism as core defining principles of the Houthi movement Ã¢Â€Â“ something that is very evident in Hussein al-HouthiÃ¢Â€Â™s sermons as early as the 1990s.

After the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Houthis adopted their current flag, whose slogan is:

Ã¢Â€ÂœGod is Great

Death to America

Death to Israel

A curse Upon the Jews

Victory to Islam.Ã¢Â€Â

This slogan represents the centrality of antisemitism to the Houthi ideology - a zero-sum world view in which Arabs and Muslims exist in perpetual enmity towards Jews, and where the problems of the Arab and Muslim world are entirely the responsibility of Israel and the United States.

According to the Houthis, turmoil in the Arab and Muslim world is because a previous, natural order Ã¢Â€Â“ in which Jews were subjugated by Arabs and Muslims Ã¢Â€Â“ has been relinquished.

In one of his most cited sermons, Hussein al-Houthi said:

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Jews, by themselves, couldn't control or secure their own existence. They needed to live under the protection of Arab leadership and Arab powers [Ã¢Â€Â¦] The Arabs are surrendering now, and with each passing day, we witness more achievements for America and Israel in their policies. Every time they lead the Arabs towards concessions, towards more submission [Ã¢Â€Â¦] If the Arabs united, if the leaders came together, they could strike Israel.Ã¢Â€Â

[Hussein al-Houthi, Ã¢Â€Â˜Lessons from the guidance of the Holy Quran - Quranic culture.Ã¢Â€Â™ August 4 2002]

In another sermon from 2001, Hussein al-Houthi cites the infamous forgery, Ã¢Â€Â˜TheÃ‚Â Protocols of the Elders of ZionÃ¢Â€Â™, to claim that Jews are constantly plotting against Muslims: Ã¢Â€ÂœTheir aim is to corrupt us, to make us into disbelievers; that is what they want.Ã¢Â€Â He went on to declare that Ã¢Â€ÂœJews and Christians are our true enemies.Ã¢Â€Â

In the sermon, Hussein al-Houthi directly quoted Khomeini to say:

Ã¢Â€ÂœI call upon all Muslims across the world and Islamic nations to unite in order to sever the hand of this oppressor and its supporters, referring to Israel.Ã¢Â€Â

He went on to cite KhomeiniÃ¢Â€Â™s call for genocide against the Jews: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Islamic world could only be safe from the evil of the Jews by eradicating them and eliminating their creation (Israel).Ã¢Â€Â

Houthi Statements About Jews:

On November 17, 2023, the Houthi television channel, Al-Masirah TV, hosted a Swedish-Algerian commentator named Yahya Abu Zakariya who stated that Ã¢Â€Âœaggression is part of the Jewish personality.Ã¢Â€Â He continued by saying that Europeans had freed themselves from such Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish aggressionÃ¢Â€Â by expelling the Jews from Europe, because during the Sabbath, ""Jews would kidnap a European child, slaughter him and offer his blood to their god, JehovahÃ¢Â€Â and that this led Europeans to write of Jews as Ã¢Â€Âœpigs, murderers, filthy, criminals, violent, and the destroyers of state institutions.Ã¢Â€Â

On November 2, 2023, the Houthi representative Mohamed Ali Al-Houthi stated that Ã¢Â€ÂœJews have been continuously working to eradicate humanity in its entirety.Ã¢Â€Â

A childrenÃ¢Â€Â™s cartoon broadcast in March 2024 on the HouthisÃ¢Â€Â™ Shaba TV network, entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Temporary Entity,Ã¢Â€Â featured antisemitic indoctrination including child-characters swearing to Ã¢Â€Âœfight and annihilate [the Jews].Ã¢Â€Â When a child character says Ã¢Â€ÂœI would like to know about the most cunning enemies of the Muslims,Ã¢Â€Â his counterparts reply Ã¢Â€Âœdo you mean the Jews?Ã¢Â€Â A group of child characters is then transported to 19th Century Budapest, where they are told Ã¢Â€Âœyou should know that the whole world hated the Jews [...] because of their evil moral values and because they are treacherous.Ã¢Â€Â The cartoon goes on to portray Theadore Herzl as dreaming of the Ã¢Â€Âœpolitical and economic control of the world.Ã¢Â€Â

Under these policies, teaching must be based on fact and allow for alternative views; teachers must ensure all sides of a controversial issue are impartially presented; students must be taught to separate opinion from fact; and no teacher or speaker may use the classroom or materials to advocate their own religious, political, economic or social views.Ã‚Â 

In addition, the SAUSD Ethnic Studies Steering Committee will be permanently disbanded; the district will stop working with the outside consultant who expressed anti-Semitic views; and SAUSD will allow for meaningful, substantive input from members of the public before any new courses are presented to the Board for approval.

The lawsuit was filed a year ago in the Superior Court in Orange County, California, by the Brandeis Center, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and the American Jewish Committee (AJC), on behalf of the Brandeis Center and its membership group,Ã‚Â  So-CUE, comprised of Orange County and Santa Ana residents, alleging SAUSD had violated CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s open meeting laws to approve these biased, anti-Semitic courses. With outside counsel from Covington & Burling LLP aggressively pursuing discovery from the District, the Jewish organizationsÃ‚Â uncovered anti-Semitic statements by Board and Committee members through depositions, affidavits, documents, text messages, and emails.Ã‚Â 

For example, Ethnic Studies Steering Committee officials mused about using Jewish holidays to approve courses at the board level to make it difficult or impossible for Jews to attend. The pejorative term Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish QuestionÃ¢Â€Â appeared on a committee agenda. Members of the Steering Committee reportedly said, Ã¢Â€ÂœJews are the oppressorsÃ¢Â€Â and do not belong in ethnic studies, referred to Jewish organizations as Ã¢Â€ÂœracistÃ¢Â€Â and urged that SAUSD not Ã¢Â€ÂœcaveÃ¢Â€Â to their concerns.Ã‚Â  That same committee member reportedly refused to call Hamas a terrorist organization even after the October 7 terrorist attack, arguing that it would be Ã¢Â€Âœdehumaniz[ing]Ã¢Â€Â to call Hamas members Ã¢Â€Âœterrorists.Ã¢Â€Â Another Committee leader referred to the only Jewish member as a Ã¢Â€Âœcolonized Jewish mindÃ¢Â€Â and a Ã¢Â€Âœf---ing babyÃ¢Â€Â for expressing concerns over anti-Semitism on the Committee.

The Steering Committee also hired an external ethnic studies consultant who equated Israel with Ã¢Â€Âœsettler colonialismÃ¢Â€Â and used social media to actively promote anti-Israel bias with anti-Semitic tropes, including a post about Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist controlÃ¢Â€Â and a comment that Ã¢Â€Âœthe Zionist CA Jewish Caucus hijacked Ethnic Studies.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Jewish staff at SAUSD complained about the Ã¢Â€Âœthinly veiled antisemitismÃ¢Â€Â coming from Steering Committee leaders and the hurtful comments said about Jews. When members of the community discovered the covert actions of the school board to approve the material, they appeared at a meeting to publicly comment but were harassed with anti-Semitism.Ã‚Â  For example, classic anti-Semitic tropes as well as threatening and violent language were used against Jews; applause broke out in response to anti-Semitic slurs; audience members hissed as the names of Jewish attendees were called; a Jewish speaker was called racist; a Jewish student who spoke at the meeting was derided as a Ã¢Â€ÂœJew boy;Ã¢Â€Â and another speaker was followed to her car and harassed by a meeting attendee.

Under the Brown Act (CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s open meeting law), AB 101 (the statute making ethnic studies a requirement for high school graduation), and other California state and federal laws, school districts are required to create courses free from bias, bigotry and discrimination, and allow for public input before approving new courses.Ã‚Â 

The Brandeis Center, ADL, AJC, and Covington & Burling LLP served as the plaintiffsÃ¢Â€Â™ counsel for this case. The StandWithUs Saidoff Legal Department supported the litigation as a legal consultant.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœEthnic studies should never become a vehicle for sneaking dangerous, anti-Semitic materials into our schools. That is the law, plain and simple, and weÃ¢Â€Â™re glad to have stopped this in Santa Ana schoolsÃ¢Â€Â said Brandeis Center Vice Chair L. Rachel Lerman.Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœUnfortunately, this dangerous and deceitful behavior is being attempted in other school districts as well. This should serve as a cautionary tale.Ã‚Â  We are watching those jurisdictions and will not hesitate to address similar violations of the law. School boards must operate in the light of day, and not Ã¢Â€Â˜under the radarÃ¢Â€Â™ as SAUSD described its own conduct.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœAnti-Semitism has no place in our communities Ã¢Â€Â“ and especially not in our schools. Here, Santa Ana, CAÃ¢Â€Â™s past Board & Committee members knew that anti-Semitism was infecting their curriculum process, and intentionally excluded the public from it,Ã¢Â€Â said James Pasch, ADL Vice President, National Litigation. Ã¢Â€ÂœOpen meeting laws exist to prevent exactly what unfolded in Santa Ana. This case sends a message Ã¢Â€Â“ not just in Santa Ana, but from coast-to-coast Ã¢Â€Â“ that if school leaders proceed with implementing anti-Semitic curriculum and material in violation of the law, we will use the courts to protect the community.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis case should serve as a warning to other California districts that try to conceal ethnic studies materials that are anti-Zionist or outright anti-Semitic,Ã¢Â€Â said AJC Chief Legal Officer Marc Stern. Ã¢Â€ÂœEthnic studies are acceptable only if adopted in the light of day and, if in the end, all sides of a controversial issue are taught by educators free of judgment. Classrooms must be places for education, not indoctrination.Ã¢Â€Â

Roz Rothstein, co-founder and CEO StandWithUs, said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIt has been our privilege to provide legal support to this effort. This lawsuit allowed us to uncover serious issues with the SAUSD's implementation of California's ethnic studies laws, leading to the critical results of ensuring that anti-Semitic material will no longer be included in these courses and improving the district's process for adopting such future courses.Ã¢Â€Â

Daniel Shallman, lead counsel for the plaintiffs from Covington & Burling LLP, added: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are honored to have joined forces with the ADL, Brandeis, AJC, and StandWithUs to hold SAUSD to account for egregious violations of CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s open meeting laws. The settlement will bring necessary sunlight to SAUSDÃ¢Â€Â™s curriculum development process and will ensure that biased, anti-Semitic content will stay out of the classroom.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/confronting-antisemitic-bullying-schools-steps-toward-understanding,"In recent years, antisemitism has been increasing and intensifying in many segments of our daily lives: on the streets, in rhetoric, through the media, in politics, workplaces and in digital spaces.

Schools have not escaped this surge. In 2023, antisemitic incidents at K-12 schools increased by 135% from the previous year to 1,162 incidents overall. Further, FBI data reveals that hate crimes in schools have more than doubled over the past five years; the most frequent victims of these hate crimes are Black, LGBTQ+ and Jewish students. With antisemitism growing in schools, in November 2023 the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights issued a Dear Colleague letter reminding school leaders of their legal obligation to address discrimination against Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, and other students.

As students move through the hallways, classrooms and lunchrooms of our K-12 schools, antisemitism shows up in a variety of ways, including bullying. Bullying is often the way that different forms of bias (e.g., antisemitism, racism, anti-Muslim bias, ableism) target young people in schools.

We define bullying as the repeated actions or threats of action directed toward a person by one or more people who have (or are perceived to have) more power or status than their target in order to cause fear, distress or harm. Unfortunately bullying is common in schools.Ã‚Â  Bullying can include verbal actions like taunting, teasing and name-calling; social interactions such as exclusion and spreading rumors; and physical actions including hitting, pushing, or breaking or taking someoneÃ¢Â€Â™s things. In addition, more than 54% of young people face cyberbullying over their lifetimes, which can take place during the school day, after school or when students go home.

The targets of bullying and cyberbullying are often young people in various marginalized communities, including Jewish students. Much of the bullying we see take place in schools is identity-based bullying, which is bullying related to a personÃ¢Â€Â™s identityÃ¢Â€Â”their religion, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, etc. Because identity-based bullying targets who the student isÃ¢Â€Â”a core part of their identityÃ¢Â€Â”it can be especially harmful. Antisemitic bullying focuses on a personÃ¢Â€Â™s Jewish identity and uses antisemitic actions, language and behaviors to cause fear, distress and harm.

There are a variety of ways that antisemitic bullying shows up in schools and targets Jewish students. Some examples include: writing a swastika on a Jewish studentÃ¢Â€Â™s notebook; taunting Jewish students with antisemitic remarks; spewing insults by blaming Jewish students for the war in Gaza; targeting Jewish students using stereotypes, tropes and conspiracy theories; pulling off a Jewish studentÃ¢Â€Â™s kippah; directing praise for Hitler or Holocaust Ã¢Â€ÂœjokesÃ¢Â€Â and concentration camp references toward Jewish students; and more. Because our online lives often mirror our in-person realities, exclusion, harassment and attacks follow young people home and into their digital lives, making the bullying constant and perpetualÃ¢Â€Â”24/7. Because bullying behavior is repeated over and over and its threat is always looming, there is compounded and ongoing harm caused to those who are targeted.

As young people face antisemitic bullying and prolonged feelings of stress and fear, they will likely be impacted in harmful ways that can interfere with their daily well-being in school, at home and in their community. The negative impact on Jewish students experiencing antisemitic bullying can be emotional (e.g., pessimism, anxiety, depression), physical (e.g., fatigue, nightmares, headaches), behavioral (e.g., clinging, aggression, withdrawing) and academic (e.g., decreased engagement, school avoidance, lower grades).

Here are some suggestions for what schools, educators, community youth programs and others who work with young people can do proactively to address and reduce antisemitic bullying:

Work as a school (or organization) to be proactive. Make sure that your schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s policies and procedures regarding bullying, harassment and discrimination are up to date and all staff are aware of their responsibilities. Because antisemitic bullying can often happen in the context of antisemitic school-based incidents, it is important to review policies and practices to empower educators and school administrators to strengthen school responses to school-based incidents.
Be more approachable for students to report bullying to you and other trusted adultsÃ¢Â€Â”and take them seriously when they do. Research shows that students are reluctant to report bullying and that reluctance increases with age. Their hesitation stems from their concern that reporting will not improve their situation and in fact, it will make it worse and they may face retaliation.
As an educator, learn about antisemitism, so that you can support Jewish students and teach others. Increase your confidence to recognize, discuss and learn more about antisemitism. Spend time in your classroom discussing antisemitism and how to counteract it and how to address bullying specifically.
Teach students the skills, knowledge and mindset for how to act as allies for when they or their peers experience bullying. Because so much of bullying takes place when adults are not around or watching and students are reluctant to report, young people can act as allies when they face or encounter bullying.
Learn more and teach students about Jewish people, culture, identity and the Jewish experience in its diversity and complexity. Learning about Jewish people and the Jewish experience can have an impact on reducing antisemitism, helping to dispel misconceptions and stereotypes and increasing understanding and empathy.

All students deserve to feel safe at schoolÃ¢Â€Â”both physically and emotionally. In order to help Jewish students feel safe, it is critical that we address and counteract all forms of bullying, including bullying that targets Jewish students and spreads antisemitism.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/numerous-anti-israel-wikipedia-editors-including-instigators-who-targeted,"New York, NY, January 17, 2025 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the disciplinary action taken against multiple editors by the Wikipedia arbitration committee in the wake of a massive effort by anti-Israel editors to spread misinformation and hate across the platform.

Among those topic-banned by Wikipedia from the Israel-Palestine discussion were Iskandar323, Selfstudier, Nableezy, Levivich and Nishidani Ã¢Â€Â“ all of whom ADL has identified as being part of a bad-faith campaign in an attempt to undermine the credibility of ADL.

Another editor, Ivana, who also participated in the campaign against ADL and was caught advocating for editorial changes offline during the bad-faith campaign, was previously banned outright from editing the online encyclopedia.

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™re pleased that the Wikipedia arbitration board has taken disciplinary action against some editors who, in our view, have spread malicious, false and biased information about Zionism and Israel across the platform. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s worth noting that several of the chief instigators of the campaign against ADL are among those now facing topic bans or outright bans for their behavior.

Ã¢Â€ÂœIn light of this, it is now imperative for Wikipedia to begin work immediately to undo the harm caused by these rogue but prolific editors who literally have wreaked havoc across the platform, causing untold harm to potentially hundreds of entries about Israel, the Oct. 7 massacre, Zionism and topics relating to antisemitism.

Ã¢Â€ÂœAs we have said before, Wikipedia needs to wake up to the reality that this is a systemic problem across the platform that needs immediate action. There is still a lot more that must be done to ensure that Wikipedia can live up to its policy around the encyclopedia holding a neutral point of view.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/tommy-robinson-five-things-know,"1. Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is a British anti-Muslim bigot with ties to far-right groups in Europe.

Stephen Yaxley-Lennon is a formerÃ‚Â soccer hooligan who, around 2009, adopted the name Tommy Robinson from another infamous soccer hooligan associated with a football club in his hometown of Luton. In October 2024, he began serving an 18-month prison term for contempt of court related to an anti-Muslim libel lawsuit he lost in 2021.

In 2004, Robinson joined the fascist British National Party (BNP), but left after one year, later claiming he didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know the group held white supremacist views. In 2009, he founded the English Defence League (EDL), an anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant organization made up of hundreds of his fellow former soccer hooligans. RobinsonÃ‚Â said he formed the group to fight radical Islam in the streets of Great Britain.

EDL, now defunct, opposed Muslim immigration to the U.K. and vilified the Muslims already living there. The group held frequent, violent protests against the Muslim community. In 2011, RobinsonÃ‚Â declared, Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Islamic community will feel the full force of the EDL if we see any of our citizens killed, maimed or hurt on British soil ever again.Ã¢Â€Â Robinson left the EDL by 2013 due to infighting and other internal problems but remained an anti-Muslim activist.Ã‚Â Hope Not Hate, a British organization that monitors extremism,Ã‚Â reported that in 2016, Robinson tweeted, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™d personally send every adult male Muslim that has come into the EU over the past 12 months back tomorrow if I could.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â In early 2017, Robinson became a reporter for the Canadian far-right website Rebel Media, where he produced anti-Muslim videos.

Robinson was arrested in May 2018 after livestreaming outside a trial involving Muslim men who were charged with sexually grooming young British girls (see below for more information). In addition, prosecutorsÃ‚Â alleged that RobinsonÃ¢Â€Â™s social media posts influencedÃ‚Â Darren Osborne, who deliberately drove a van into a group of Muslims near a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, in June 2017, killing one person and injuring several others. In a separate case in November 2018, Robinson publicly accused a Muslim teen, who was a refugee, of being aÃ‚Â violent school bully. That teen successfully sued Robinson for libel in 2019 and won in 2021. RobinsonÃ¢Â€Â™s current prison term stems from that case; he reiterated his claims against the teenager, even after being found guilty of libel.

2. RobinsonÃ¢Â€Â™s anti-immigrant rhetoric and protests in the U.K. attracted the attention and support of anti-immigrant activists in the U.S.

The EDLÃ¢Â€Â™s anti-immigrant views, mostly directed at Muslims, mobilized Britons and attracted support from xenophobic groups in the U.S. At its peak and under RobinsonÃ¢Â€Â™s leadership, EDL attracted thousands of people, including neo-Nazis and other white supremacists, to anti-Muslim demonstrations, becoming what Media Matters referred to in aÃ‚Â 2010 media report as Ã¢Â€Âœthe most significant far-right street movement in the UK since the National Front in the 1970s.Ã¢Â€Â Hope Not HateÃ‚Â reported that EDL created alliances with other anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim groups in Europe and the United States, Ã¢Â€Âœincluding neo-conservative organisations and the anti-Islam wing of the Tea Party movement.Ã¢Â€Â

Pamela Geller, an anti-Muslim activist who founded the groupÃ‚Â Stop Islamization of America in 2009, repeatedly praised EDL, and in 2010 wrote in the conservative publicationÃ‚Â American ThinkerÃ‚Â that ""Free people should support the English Defence League in its efforts to stand for England and the West against the belligerent invaders and Islamic imperialists."" Ann Coulter, another American anti-immigration activist, also praised the EDL and Robinson inÃ‚Â a 2013 article in the Daily Caller, a conservative publication.

Former Fox News personality Bill OÃ¢Â€Â™ReillyÃ‚Â gave Robinson a platform to express his views in a 2013 interview, in which Robinson described his anti-Muslim activity as a Ã¢Â€Âœfight for Christianity, fight for our children's future, fight for our culture, and fight for our country's identity, which is completely under attack."" After serving time in prison for mortgage fraud in 2014,Ã‚Â Robinson joined the German anti-immigrant group Pegida, establishing a local branch in England, where he tried (unsuccessfully) to replicate their tactics and strategies.Ã‚Â 

3. RobinsonÃ¢Â€Â™s anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views have drawn support from far-right figures in the U.S.

Far-right figures in the U.S. have expressed admiration and support for Robinson. In 2018, when Robinson was jailed on a contempt of court charge for livestreaming outside a trial of Muslim men charged with grooming British girls (see below), tens of thousands of Britons signed petitions for his release. In addition, many American far-right figures claimed (falsely) that Robinson was arrested because of his comments about Muslims and that British officials violated his free speech rights. Robinson received support in 2018 from a range of figures. Donald Trump, Jr., tweeted, Ã¢Â€ÂœDonÃ¢Â€Â™t let America follow in those footsteps.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Steve Bannon, a former advisor to the Trump administration, told a reporter, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou lose guys like Tommy Robinson youÃ¢Â€Â™re not going to have a country.Ã¢Â€Â Daniel Pipes, the head of the conservative think tank Middle East Forum and David Horowitz of the right-wing David Horowitz Foundation, also vocally supported Robinson.

U.S. RepresentativeÃ‚Â Paul Gosar (R-AZ) also bolstered Robinson and made disparaging remarks about Muslims at a pro-Robinson rally in London in July 2018 which attracted thousands of supporters as part of the Ã¢Â€ÂœFree TommyÃ¢Â€Â movement. Afterwards, Pipes and HorowitzÃ‚Â invited Robinson to the U.S., while GosarÃ‚Â invited Robinson to address the Congressional Conservative Opportunity Society. RobinsonÃ‚Â was denied a visa afterÃ‚Â dozens of British MembersÃ‚Â of Parliament and organizations (including the ADL) warned about the potential rise in extremism and violenceÃ‚Â among his supporters in the U.K. if he was allowed into the United States.

4. Robinson has a laundry list of criminal activity, including using a false identity, fraud and contempt of court.

Robinson has been arrested and imprisoned numerous times in Great Britain. Most recently, authoritiesÃ‚Â jailed Robinson in October 2024 for 18 months for contempt of court after violating an injunction forbidding him to show Ã¢Â€ÂœSilenced,Ã¢Â€Â a self-produced documentaryÃ‚Â that repeated libelous charges Robinson originally made against a Muslim refugee teen in 2018. Robinson publicly labeled the teen aÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Âœviolent school bully,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â and was found guilty of libel.

In 2021, a five-year order of protection was entered against RobinsonÃ‚Â for stalking a female British journalist who was doing an expose on his handling of supportersÃ¢Â€Â™ contributions. In January 2014, Robinson was jailed for 18 months for mortgage fraud. In January 2013, Robinson was sentenced to jail time for trying to enter the U.S.Ã‚Â with a false identity document. In July 2011, Robinson was arrested and handed a 12-month community rehabilitation order after he was convicted of leadingÃ‚Â a brawl involving more than 100 football fans.Ã‚Â 

5. RobinsonÃ¢Â€Â™s recent activity demonstrates his ongoing anti-Muslim bigotry.

In January 2022, RobinsonÃ‚Â created a series of documentaries about the sexual grooming of young girls in Britain. About 1,500 people attended the screening for the first documentary, and he followed up with four more which did not attract as much attention.

While a court injunctionÃ‚Â prevented him from showing his film, Ã¢Â€ÂœSilenced,Ã¢Â€Â Robinson moved to Spain in 2023 and subsequentlyÃ‚Â showed a version of the film, released by MICE Media, at a meeting with the Danish Parliament in Copenhagen. The meeting was hosted by the Danish PeopleÃ¢Â€Â™s Party, a right-wing populist party that focuses on immigration, and The Free Press Society. He also gave numerous interviews about the film, where he repeated his false claims.

Robinson returned to the U.K. in late 2023. After the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, RobinsonÃ‚Â called on his supporters to protect British monuments from pro-Palestinian marchers during a protest held on Armistice Day (November 11). Robinson, however, allegedly fled the scene when confrontations between his supporters and the police turned violent.Ã‚Â 

In July 2024, RobinsonÃ‚Â screened his film Ã¢Â€ÂœSilencedÃ¢Â€Â to thousands of supporters in LondonÃ¢Â€Â™s Trafalgar Square, declaring that he would not be silenced. In October 2024,Ã‚Â he received his jail sentence for violating the injunction to not spread false allegations about the Muslim teen.","[1, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/hate-and-harassment-present-almost-half-online-multiplayer-gaming-sessions,"New York, NY, January 16, 2025, Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã‚Â  Hate and harassment was recorded in almost half of online multiplayer game sessions tested with a range of religious, ethnic and national identity-based usernames, shows new research conducted by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society. Examples of hate and harassment includedÃ‚Â racial slurs, trash-talking or disrupted play.

Identity-based harassment was present in one-third of play sessions across the four games (Valorant, Counterstrike 2, Overwatch 2Ã‚Â and Fortnite) played by participants (student researchers) using usernames Ã¢Â€ÂœProud2bJewishÃ¢Â€Â, Ã¢Â€ÂœProud2bMuslimÃ¢Â€Â, Ã¢Â€ÂœProud2bChineseÃ¢Â€Â, Ã¢Â€ÂœProud2bIsraeliÃ¢Â€Â, and Ã¢Â€ÂœProud2bMexicanÃ¢Â€Â. In some sessions, people were not just harassed based on their specific username but also encountered instances of general identity-based harassment or harassment toward multiple other identities.


Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe unacceptable normalization of harassment in online games is not only concerning because of how widespread it is and because so many teens and young people are exposed to hate in these spaces, but also because of the intensity of the verbal abuse weÃ¢Â€Â™ve recorded,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœHearing phrases such as Ã¢Â€Â˜gas the JewsÃ¢Â€Â™, calling people the Ã¢Â€Â˜n-wordÃ¢Â€Â™ or seeing a player named Hitler is not inconsequential; itÃ¢Â€Â™s pure, unabashed hatred andÃ‚Â gaming companiesÃ‚Â need to step up and make it stop.Ã¢Â€Â
Ã‚Â 


Among the four games tested, Valorant and Counterstrike 2 stood out for resulting in some type of harassment in about two-thirds of the game sessions; half had identity-based harassment. Overwatch 2 and Fortnite, in contrast, showed the least amount of identity-based harassment (8 percent for Overwatch 2 and 20 percent for Fortnite). In Valorant and Counterstrike 2, over half (57 percent) of the play sessions with the Ã¢Â€Â˜Proud2bJewishÃ¢Â€Â™ username included some level of Jewish identity-based harassment.

ADL has been investigating hate and harassmentÃ¢Â€Â”as well as prosocial behaviorÃ¢Â€Â”in online multiplayer games since 2019. Six out of ten people (ages 5-90) in the U.S. play video games, according to theÃ‚Â Entertainment Software Association, and there are over 3 billion players around the world.Ã‚Â In 2023, ADL found that 76 percent of adult participants (aged 18-45) and 75 percent of teens (ages 10-17) in online multiplayer games reported experiencing any harassment in online games.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœAs increasing numbers of people engage in online gaming spaces, we need to find ways to minimize disruptive behavior, hate and harassment,Ã¢Â€Â said Daniel Kelley, Interim Head & Director of Strategy and Operations, ADL Center for Technology and Society. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe gaming industry and government have a responsibility to make sure people feel safe while engaging in competitive online gaming. As shown in our research, these spaces can lead to prosocial behavior, which should not be overshadowed by the rampant abuse weÃ¢Â€Â™re recording. At the same time, itÃ¢Â€Â™s alarming that one of the main responses across all participants in the study was that they expected there to be even more hate than there was.Ã¢Â€Â

The report also included detailed recommendations for the gaming industry, government, researchers and caregivers. The full list is available at the end of the report.

Recommendations for industry:

Implement industry-wide policy and design practices to better address how hate targets specific identities.
Incentivize and promote prosocial behavior through design.
Rather than reducing Trust & Safety headcount, as many companies have done in 2023 and 2024, companies must expand resources in this important area.
Improve reporting systems and support for targets of harassment.
Strengthen content-moderation tools for in-game voice chat.
Release regular, consistent transparency reports on hate and harassment.

Recommendations for government:

In February 2024, ADL released its annual report Hate is No Game: Hate and Harassment in Online Games 2023Ã‚Â in which the need for governments to take a more active role in fighting hate and harassment in games was highlighted:

Prioritize transparency legislation in digital spaces and include online multiplayer games.
Enhance access to justice for victims of online abuse.
Establish a National Gaming Safety Task Force.
Resource research efforts.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-statement-announcement-israel-hamas-deal,"New York, NY, January 15, 2025 ... ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today issued the following statement in response to the agreement between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of 33 hostages held captive in Gaza since October 7, 2023.

ADL issued the following statement:

We welcome the agreement that has been reached between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of 33 hostages who were inhumanely kidnapped and cruelly held captive by Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza since October 7, 2023.

For over 15 months, family members, friends, and many across Israel and the world, fought tirelessly and unwaveringly on behalf of the hostages, and today there is finally hope that they will return home.Ã‚Â 

We are deeply appreciative to all those involved in helping this agreement come to fruition, including President Biden and President-elect Trump, who have long committed to ensure the release of the hostages.

We call on the incoming Trump Administration, and relevant global and regional actors, to make certain that Hamas upholds its commitments and releases all hostages.Ã‚Â 

We reiterate our pledge to not rest until all 98 hostages held captive in Gaza are freed and returned to their families.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/terrorgram-collective-international-terrorists-promoting-violence-and-white,"On January 13, 2025, the United States Department of State designated the Terrorgram Collective and three of its foreign leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), formally including Terrorgram among other international terrorist groups. Ã‚Â 

Terrorgram is a decentralized network of white supremacist, neo-Nazi and accelerationist groups and individuals connected primarily through the encrypted social networking app Telegram, with the collective goal of promoting stochastic terrorism and inspiring individuals to conduct either group-oriented or Ã¢Â€Âœlone wolfÃ¢Â€Â terror attacks. The network first began to take shape in 2019 and 2020, in the wake of Australian white supremacist Brenton TarrantÃ¢Â€Â™s deadly terror attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Terrorgram members seek to convince more white supremacists to conduct similar violent attacks in service of their accelerationist ideology.Ã‚Â 

Key Facts to Know:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

The white supremacist ideology behind Terrorgram promotes violent actions and sabotage to achieve goals.

Accelerationism, the main ideology promoted by Terrorgram, is a belief system within some segments of the white supremacist movement that promotes violent actions and sabotage as means to accelerate a perceived inevitable collapse of society, allowing followers to establish a white ethno-state in the aftermath. Since its emergence and spread in the late 2010s, white supremacist accelerationism has inspired multiple terrorist plots and attacks in countries around the world. Ã‚Â Adherents of the ideology generate propaganda, shared primarily online, that venerates past far-right killersÃ¢Â€Â”often referring to them as Ã¢Â€ÂœsaintsÃ¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Â”and encourages people to emulate them, suggesting that they too would be remembered as saints after committing their violent acts.

Terrorgram propaganda is designed to inspire readers to commit extreme violence against marginalized groups. Ã‚Â 

The Terrorgram Collective is an inner circle of Terrorgram propagandists, who create and disseminate zine-style digital publications called the Terrorgram Publications, which contain instructional manuals and creative works of fiction with distinctive layouts and design. They are designed to inspire readers to commit acts of extreme violence against people and acts of sabotage and destruction against critical infrastructure targets. The publications frequently demonize Jews, Muslims, people of color, immigrants, and the LGTBQ+ community, and particularly glorify acts of violence, such as mass shootings, committed against these communities. Ã‚Â 

Terrorgram Collective and their publications have directly inspired multiple terror acts and plots in the U.S. and abroad.

The Terrorgram Collective and their publications have directly inspired multiple recent terror attacks and plots both in the United States as well as abroad, including a shooting outside an LGBTQ+ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, in 2022; a mass stabbing attack at a mosque in EskiÃ…ÂŸehir, Turkey, in 2024; and an alleged plot to destroy an energy facility in East Brunswick, New Jersey, in 2024.

U.S. authorities designated the Terrorgram Collective and its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).

On September 5, 2024, federal authorities arrested Matthew Allison of Boise, Idaho, and Dallas Humber of Elk Grove, California, for their alleged leadership roles in the Terrorgram Collective, charging them with soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. Ã‚Â When the U.S. Department of State designated the Terrorgram Collective as SDGTs in January 2025, they specifically designated three of their foreign leadersÃ¢Â€Â”Ciro Daniel Amorim Ferreira of Brazil, Noah Licul of Croatia, and Hendrik-Wahl Muller of South Africa--as SDGTs, as well.","[2, 3, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.2, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/los-angeles-wildfires-trigger-conspiracy-theories-and-hate,"As devastating wildfires continue to decimate sections of Los Angeles, California, extremists and conspiracy theorists are spreading familiar falsehoods, blaming the blaze on common scapegoats such as diversity initiatives, Jews and nefarious government Ã¢Â€Âœfalse flags.Ã¢Â€Â

Fires that began in the Pacific Palisades area on January 7, 2025, are now part of a broader set of blazes across the city. Officials believe the fires were caused primarily by drought conditions, high winds and the cumulative effects of climate change.

Despite these facts, extremists and promoters of hate continue to spread false narratives about the fires to target marginalized groups and sow distrust Ã¢Â€Â” a tactic theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve deployed following disasters and extreme weather phenomena for years.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #1: Fires were caused by prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion

One of the most prevalent false narratives suggests the fires are linked to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

Many targeted Los Angeles fire chief Kristin Crowley, the first female and openly LGBTQ+ person in her position, suggesting Ã¢Â€Â” without evidence Ã¢Â€Â” that she favored DEI initiatives over disaster preparedness, or hired unqualified candidates in the name of diversity. Ã‚Â 

On Telegram, one Proud Boys chapter shared a meme featuring Crowley that read, Ã¢Â€Âœ0% contained 100% DEI.Ã¢Â€Â Another Proud Boys chapter posted an image of flames near Sunset Boulevard with the caption, Ã¢Â€ÂœWoke has consequences.Ã¢Â€Â

Similar theories also circulated after the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Extremists often blame disasters on factors like DEI and female leadership, a narrative that allows them to promote racism, misogyny and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric while denying the impact of climate change. Ã‚Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #2: Jews are responsible forÃ¢Â€Â” and deserve to suffer because of Ã¢Â€Â” the wildfires

Invoking classic tropes about disproportionate Jewish influence, antisemitic figures on social media blamed Jews at large for the Los Angeles wildfires. Ã‚Â 

On X, antisemitic conspiracy theorist Stew Peters reshared a post that referred to Stewart and Lynda Resnick Ã¢Â€Â” owners of the Wonderful Company Ã¢Â€Â” as a Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish billionaire coupleÃ¢Â€Â with the caption, Ã¢Â€ÂœIt really is one group causing all the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s problems.Ã¢Â€Â Rumors about the Resnicks have falsely accused them of Ã¢Â€ÂœcontrollingÃ¢Â€Â the water in California, suggesting they contributed to water shortages that have made it harder to contain the fires.Ã‚Â 

Stew Peters alluding to Ã¢Â€Âœone group causing all the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s problemsÃ¢Â€Â in post mentioning Resnick couple. Source: X

On Telegram, antisemitic conspiracy theorist Ali Alexander asked why Jews were not fighting fires or acting as Ã¢Â€Âœpublic servantsÃ¢Â€Â and questioned Jewish ownership of the insurance companies that are denying claims, implying that Jewish people act solely out of self-interest, even at the expense of others. While homeowners affected by the fire have indeed struggled with getting adequate insurance coverage, the notion that the companies in question are all controlled by Jews is based in antisemitic tropes about Jewish control and greed.Ã‚Â 

Others expressed glee over the fires, specifically pointing out impacted areas with large Jewish populations. On Telegram, Christopher Pohlhaus, leader of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, shared a post alluding to the destruction of Ã¢Â€Âœexpensive Jewish neighborhoods,Ã¢Â€Â simultaneously promoting a misleading (and debunked) GAI image showing the iconic Hollywood sign in flames.

Christopher Pohlhaus sharing a post with GAI image, referencing Ã¢Â€Âœexpensive Jewish neighborhoods.Ã¢Â€Â Source: TelegramÃ‚Â 

Some even suggested that Jews brought the destruction upon themselves after making God angry. On X, one antisemitic influencer shared images of the Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center, which burned down in the blaze, stating, Ã¢Â€ÂœGod is mad at the jews [sic].Ã¢Â€Â On Telegram, accelerationist platform The American Futurist shared similar sentiments, claiming the fires Ã¢Â€Âœare a divine act against our jewish [sic] overlords and they deserve it.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #3: IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s war in Gaza caused the fires

Anti-Zionist influencers and groups are blaming Israel as a key catalyst for the wildfires. Ã‚Â 

For example, on X, far right and anti-Zionist influencer Jackson Hinkle suggested that U.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has taken away from the Los Angeles Fire DepartmentÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to combat the fires; his post has garnered over 26K likes. Similar narratives followed the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in 2024, when false claims suggested that FEMA had insufficient funds for hurricane relief due to U.S. aid towards Israel.

Anti-Zionist groups including Code Pink and certain chapters of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) attempted to draw explicit connections between IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s war in Gaza and the Los Angeles wildfires. On Instagram, these groups suggested that IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s military actions are a form of ecocide, meaning that IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s actions in Gaza are contributing disproportionately to global warming or that aid to Israel means the U.S. government doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t have adequate funds to fight the fires and climate change generally.

While there is evidence that armed conflict impacts climate change, singling out Israel speaks to an agenda of demonizing and scapegoating Israel Ã¢Â€Â” rather than highlighting the actual climate crisis. Ã‚Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #4: The wildfires are the product of an Ã¢Â€Âœinside jobÃ¢Â€Â by Hollywood or the government

Purveyors of mis- and disinformation are leveraging the Los Angeles wildfires to spread Ã¢Â€Âœfalse flagÃ¢Â€Â conspiracy theories. Ã‚Â 

On X, Stew Peters argued that these Ã¢Â€Âœgeo-engineered firesÃ¢Â€Â are a deliberate weaponization of weather modification by the government, which he alleges is Ã¢Â€Âœtrying to kill us.Ã¢Â€Â Far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones echoed similar claims, blaming the fires on Ã¢Â€ÂœA Larger Globalist Plot To Wage Economic Warfare [sic].Ã¢Â€Â

Alex Jones suggests wildfires prove that Ã¢Â€ÂœglobalistsÃ¢Â€Â are plotting against the United States. Source: X

This narrative also surfaced following the Maui wildfires in 2023, which conspiracy theorists similarly blamed on Ã¢Â€Âœdirected energy weaponsÃ¢Â€Â and government-controlled weather. Posts on X mentioning Ã¢Â€Âœdirected energy weaponsÃ¢Â€Â have increased considerably since the fires began, with nearly 47K mentions on the platform since January 7.

Others claimed the fires were set deliberately to cover up evidence of prominent AngelenosÃ¢Â€Â™ nefarious activity. QAnon believers claimed that Hunter BidenÃ¢Â€Â™s home was destroyed in the fires Ã¢Â€Â” an event they called Ã¢Â€ÂœconvenientÃ¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â€Â” and that the destruction was a deliberate attempt to cover up crimes. Ã‚Â While BidenÃ¢Â€Â™s home was indeed in the path of the fires, the scale of damage is not yet clear and there is no indication that it was deliberately targeted.

Similar theories suggested that the fires were coordinated to cover up evidence of sex trafficking in Hollywood, pointing out fires near the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, confusing that location with the Getty Museum. The latter is frequently cited by QAnon and Ã¢Â€ÂœSave The ChildrenÃ¢Â€Â conspiracy theorists, who for years have promoted the unfounded claim that thousands of children are being held in tunnels under the museum.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/46-adults-worldwide-hold-significant-antisemitic-beliefs-adl-poll-finds,"The survey shows that anti-Jewish sentiments are at an all-time high globally, revealing areas where governments must take action to tackle antisemitic hate.

New York, NY, January 14, 2025 ... Nearly half of all people worldwide hold elevated levels of antisemitic attitudes, according to the latest Global 100 survey conducted by ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and coordinated with Ipsos and other research partners. The survey found that 46 percent of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s adult population Ã¢Â€Â“ an estimated 2.2 billion people Ã¢Â€Â“ harbor deeply entrenched antisemitic attitudes, more than double compared to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s first worldwide survey a decade ago and the highest level on record since ADL started tracking these trends globally.

First launched in 2014, the ADL Global 100 remains the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s most extensive study of antisemitic attitudes globally. For the latest survey, over 58,000 adults from 103 countries and territories were surveyed, representing 94 percent of the global adult population.

The survey also found that 20 percent of respondents worldwide have not heard about the Holocaust. Less than half (48 percent) recognize the HolocaustÃ¢Â€Â™s historical accuracy, which falls to 39 percent among 18- to 34-year-olds, highlighting a worrying demographic trend. Respondents younger than 35 also have elevated levels of antisemitic sentiments (50 percent), 13 percentage points higher than respondents over 50.

Despite the alarming findings about antisemitic attitudes and Holocaust awareness, Global 100 data highlights areas where governments can take action to begin to reverse these trends. Governments can count on the support of an encouraging majority (59%) of respondents globally who recognize that hate towards Jews is a serious problem in the world. This also holds true for a majority of respondents across all seven geographical regions, age groups, education levels, and political orientations.

Ã¢Â€ÂœAntisemitism is nothing short of a global emergency, especially in a post-October 7 world. We are seeing these trends play out from the Middle East to Asia, from Europe to North and South America,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœNegative attitudes towards Jews are an important pillar that ADL uses to assess overall levels of antisemitism within a country, and our findings are deeply alarming. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s clear that we need new government interventions, more education, additional safeguards on social media, and new security protocols to prevent antisemitic hate crimes. This fight requires a whole-of-society approach Ã¢Â€Â“ including government, civil society and individuals and now is the time to act.Ã¢Â€Â

The Global 100 Index Score represents the percentage of respondents who answered Ã¢Â€Âœdefinitely trueÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœprobably trueÃ¢Â€Â to six or more of the 11 negative stereotypes about Jews that were tested. Three quarters (76%) of respondents inÃ‚Â the Middle East and North Africa believe most of the 11 tropes to be true. Around half of the respondents in Asia (51%), Eastern Europe (49%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (45%) harbor high levels of antisemitic attitudes. The Americas (24%), Western Europe (17%), and Oceania (20%) have relatively lower levels of antisemitic attitudes, yet still around one in five adults harbor these sentiments.

According to the survey, the countries and territories with the highest Index Scores include the West Bank and Gaza (97%), Kuwait (97%), and Indonesia (96%), while those with the lowest Index Scores are Sweden (5%), Norway (8%), Canada (8%), and the Netherlands (8%).

Ã¢Â€ÂœAntisemitic tropes and beliefs are becoming alarmingly normalized across societies worldwide. This dangerous trend is not just a threat to Jewish communitiesÃ¢Â€Â”itÃ¢Â€Â™s a warning to us all. Even in countries with the lowest levels of antisemitic attitudes globally, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen many antisemitic incidents perpetrated by an emboldened small, vocal and violent minority. This is a wake-up call for collective action, and we are committed to continuing our work with our partners around the world to confront and mitigate this deeply ingrained antisemitism,Ã¢Â€Â said Marina Rosenberg, ADL Senior Vice President for International Affairs.

In addition to the 11 Index questions, the survey asked other questions related to Jews, as well as attitudes towards Israel and engagement with Israeli people and businesses. While sentiments toward Israel are mixed, more than seven in ten respondents believe their country should have diplomatic relationships with Israel (71%) and welcome tourists from Israel (75%). Notably, over two thirds of respondents (67%) do not want their country to boycott Israeli products and businesses.

The survey was conducted via telephone, face-to-face, and online using nationally representative probability sampling in each country or territory and has a margin of error ofÃ‚Â Ã‚Â±4.4% for sample size 500 (the vast majority of countries) andÃ‚Â Ã‚Â±3.2% for sample size 1,000. Fieldwork and data collection were conducted and coordinated by Ipsos in all countries outside of the Middle East and North Africa region. Data collection for countries in the Middle East and North Africa region were conducted and coordinated by GDCC, Ronin, and Catalyze Global Research. All interviews were conducted between July 23 and November 13, 2024.

Among the Global 100 surveyÃ¢Â€Â™s key findings:

Alarmingly, younger respondents worldwideÃ‚Â show a greater prevalence of antisemitic attitudes. For example, 40% of those under age 35 affirm that Ã¢Â€ÂœJews are responsible for most of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s warsÃ¢Â€Â while it is 29% for those over 50, a remarkable 11 percentage point difference.
23% of respondents worldwide express favorable opinions toward the Palestinian terror group Hamas, which increases to 29% among respondents younger than 35.
Only 16% of the respondents in the Middle East and North Africa and 23% in Sub-Saharan Africa recognize the historical accuracy of the Holocaust.

The fight against antisemitism requires countries to adopt and implement a whole-of-society strategy that involves all levels of government, corporations, academia, civil society, and the public. While no one action or policy can end antisemitism, ADL urges governments, as well as international and non-governmental organizations, to adopt and implement theÃ‚Â Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism, just as scores of governments and organizations around the world have already done to mitigate the threat and protect Jewish communities.

Negative attitudes toward Jews are one part of how ADL assesses levels of antisemitism. ADL also accounts for the number and nature of antisemitic incidents annually, polls of Jewish communities about their experiences with antisemitism, government policies, and other factors.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/palestine-news-network-pnn-five-things-know,"1. Overview: Palestine News Network (PNN) is a network of people who harass strangers, often Jews, prodding them about their stance on Palestine. The group also expresses support for anti-Israel terror and violence.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Individuals associated with PNN have a history of entering neighborhoods with significant Jewish populations, or approaching those attending Jewish or Israel-related events, where they shoot videos that walk the line between Ã¢Â€ÂœinterviewÃ¢Â€Â and provocation.

PNN also posts videos or other content celebrating the death of Israelis, the October 7 terror attacks, news of terror attacks in Israel, and expressing support for terror groups like Hamas and dictators, such as the former leader of Syria Bashar al Assad.

PNN has also posted in support of Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan, an 18-year-old Egyptian national suspected of plotting a mass-casualty attack targeting the Israeli Consulate in New York. In December 2024, Iranian backed outletÃ‚Â HispanTV published a puff piece interview about the group as a part of a segment on Ã¢Â€Âœalternative voices for Palestine.Ã¢Â€Â

2. Leadership: Ramsey Aburdene and David Wolf, who founded PNN in the aftermath of the October 7th terror attacks, routinely celebrate violence targeting Israel.

Ramsey Aburdene, who goes by Abu Rahss on social media, is an aspiring rapper and the founder of Forest Hills Tenleytown Music Group (FHTMG), a music production company. Approximately 10 years ago, he produced a hip-hop music video in North Korea. He also uses the FHTMG Instagram to promote PNN. A 2014 article in The GuardianÃ‚Â described Aburdene as anÃ‚Â investment banker, though more recent publications do not refer to him in this way.

Aburdene explicitly supports the October 7 terror attacks and terror leaders such as Yahya Sinwar, and says heÃ¢Â€Â™s told people for years to Ã¢Â€Âœstop condemning Hamas.Ã¢Â€Â

Picture of Ramsey Aburdene (forefront) in a music video. (Screenshot/YouTube)

Ã‚Â 

Aburdene has also posted antisemitic content on Facebook. In February 2024, he posted a photo of a person wearing a keffiyeh being cut up by a knife stylized as the Jewish Star of David (and a fork stylized as an American flag).

David Wolf is a Jewish man from New Jersey and an extreme anti-Zionist. He notably had his Star of David tattooed over with a Palestinian flag and often joins Aburdene at events. Wolf posted that they tried (unsuccessfully) to enter the November 2024 Stand Together event in Washington, D.C., honoring the first anniversary of the October 7 terror attacks, which they referred to as the Ã¢Â€ÂœStand Together Nuremberg bash.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â 

Wolf celebrates Hamas leadership, such as spokesperson Abu Obeida and former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and lauds Hezbollah attacks.

A post from Aburdene's Facebook page depicting Hamas terrorists with the text, Ã¢Â€ÂœNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, itÃ¢Â€Â™s the only thing that ever has,Ã¢Â€Â published on October 10, 2023. (Screenshot/ Facebook)

Ã‚Â 

Additional leaders and supporters include Dr. Pressure, also known as Abdulrahman Abed, of Los Angeles, a frequent, vocal and enthusiastic PNN booster who occasionally assists with filming. He has posted on his Instagram that Ã¢Â€Âœthere is absolutely no such thing as an Ã¢Â€Â˜innocent Israeli,Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â and claimed that Israel was the mastermind behind 9/11.

An Instagram post by David Wolf reading Ã¢Â€ÂœHappy Veterans DayÃ¢Â€Â with an image of Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida, November 2024. (Screenshot/Instagram)

Ã‚Â 

Another PNN associate, Essa Ejelat, of New York, uses the names Ã¢Â€ÂœPNN.virtualÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestinians_united2,Ã¢Â€Â to harass Israelis on video chats. Yoseph Haddad, an Arab Israeli and pro-Israel activist, accused Ejelat of assaulting him at a protest at Columbia in April 2024. Ejelat also has been arrested at least twice for his alleged unlawful behavior at protests.Ã‚Â 

3.Ã‚Â Tactics: PNN targets events and people they consider Ã¢Â€Âœpro-Israel,Ã¢Â€Â including survivors of the 10/7 terror attacks

PNN associates have approached survivors of the Nova Music Festival, which was targeted on October 7, 2023, particularly at U.S. memorials for those killed. They were at the Los Angeles Nova Exhibition in November 2024, asking attendees if they supported Ã¢Â€Âœthe killing of babiesÃ¢Â€Â and chanting, Ã¢Â€ÂœFree Palestine.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  They harassed a Nova survivor outside the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles in December 2024, suggesting that he was lying about being shot at the festival. In a Twitter post, PNN describes Nova as happening ""right outside the Gaza Concentration Camp.Ã¢Â€Â

In May 2024, in Washington D.C., Aburdene approached U.S. Congressman Brian Mast (R-FL), a U.S. Army veteran and staunch supporter of Israel, asking where his legs went and if he had a red triangle Ã¢Â€Âœgo over his head,Ã¢Â€Â a reference to a Hamas symbol used in its propaganda videos to show an Israeli military target. Mast lost both of his legs in combat in Afghanistan.

In Los Angeles in December 2024, PNN approached two men, one of whom was wearing a Ã¢Â€Âœfree the hostagesÃ¢Â€Â yellow pin and badgered them about their stance Ã¢Â€Âœon Palestine.Ã¢Â€Â In the edited video of the encounter, PNN briefly flashes an inverted red triangle over the hostage pin. (Screenshot/TikTok)

Ã‚Â 

PNN associates also harass attendees at pro-Israel events. In December 2024, PNN protested a Friends of IDF gala fundraiser in Los Angeles, filming individuals and calling attendees Ã¢Â€Âœbaby killers.Ã¢Â€Â Aburdene filmed himself harassing an elderly couple getting out of a car to attend an event at the Israeli embassy in Washington D.C., saying Ã¢Â€ÂœIsrael is going down the tubes, just like you two.Ã¢Â€Â The post is dated November 29, 2024.Ã‚Â 

What they are most notorious for, however, is approaching people at outdoor restaurants or patios to ask them about Palestine.Ã‚Â  In November 2024, in Beverly Hills, California, PNN associates filmed themselves yelling that Israel is a Ã¢Â€Âœa Rothschild state,Ã¢Â€Â not a Jewish state. They also focused on someone who was trying to eat, yelling at him that he is a baby killer and war criminal and has a Ã¢Â€Âœtriangle on top of his head.Ã¢Â€Â

4. Network: PNN content is shared by anti-Zionist activists around the world.

Anti-Zionist activists including prominent Ã¢Â€Âœanti-imperialist journalistÃ¢Â€Â Benjamin Rubenstein shared PNNÃ¢Â€Â™s interaction with U.S. Congressman Brian Mast. Other well-known anti-Israel personalities have shared PNN content, including JVP Rabbinical Council member Rabbi David Mivasair, and Maram Susli, better known by her X handle Ã¢Â€ÂœSyrian Girl,Ã¢Â€Â a 9/11 Ã¢Â€ÂœtrutherÃ¢Â€Â who is a known source of disinformation about Syria, whitewashing former Syrian president Bashar al AssadÃ¢Â€Â™s numerous crimes against humanity.

Antisemitic conspiracy theorist and UK-based rapper Lowkey and notorious disinformation source Sulaiman Ahmed have also reposted PNN content.

The group has drawn criticism from pro-Israel advocates as well as anti-Zionists, who feel their tactics are overly aggressive.

5. Online impact and income streams: PNN accounts are frequently (and often only briefly) deplatformed by mainstream social media platforms.Ã‚Â 

In an interview on June 27, 2024, Aburdene noted, Ã¢Â€ÂœI had several ... Tik ToksÃ¢Â€Â¦ this is my fourth one and I just started this year in Instagram. They just deleted my second one this year so I'm on my third Instagram....Ã¢Â€Â In an Instagram post showing PNNÃ¢Â€Â™s alleged metrics on TikTok, they claimed that between October 10-December 15, 2024, their posts racked up over 30 million views. They also claimed the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s TikTok, created around September 2024, was the ninth one theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve had to make; in December 2024, PNN announced that account had also been banned. Numerous personal accounts stand in when official PNN accounts are removed.Ã‚Â 

PNN claims not to make any money from its social media.Ã‚Â  The Instagram page Ã¢Â€ÂœGasrow, LLCÃ¢Â€Â previously sold PNN merchandise on their website, and continues to do so on a TikTok shop. They claim all proceeds go to Gaza.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-deeply-concerned-about-metas-trust-and-safety-changes,"New York, NY, January 7, 2025 ... ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) expressed deep concern today about MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s policy announcement in terms of their commitment to addressing antisemitism and hate.

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

Ã¢Â€ÂœIt is mind blowing how one of the most profitable companies in the world, operating with such sophisticated technology, is taking significant steps back in terms of addressing antisemitism, hate, misinformation and protecting vulnerable & marginalized groups online. The only winner here is MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s bottom line and as a result, all of society will suffer.""


The ADL Center for Technology and Society further commented on the changes:

Meta indicates that outside of some specific forms of harm (terrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams) it will not do proactive enforcement of their policies and will rely on user reporting. OurÃ‚Â recent report cardÃ‚Â shows however that Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram) responded to exactly zero cases of antisemitic content when reported as average users.
Ã‚Â 
Meta must significantly reform their average user reporting process unless they intend to completely abdicate their responsibility to address antisemitism and hate at a time when it is surging online and offline.
Ã‚Â 
Moreover, it is dangerous that Meta will be Ã¢Â€Âœgetting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and genderÃ¢Â€Â.Ã‚Â Our research showsÃ‚Â that LGBTQ+ users, especially transgender users, receive the most harassment of any marginalized groups and that Facebook is the platform where users are harassed the most overall regardless of their identity. It is one thing to discuss policy, but Meta should focus their attention on prioritizing the protection of marginalized users, not opening the floodgates for attacks based on identity.
Ã‚Â 
Finally, it's unclear the factual basis for MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s change toward Ã¢Â€Âœcommunity notesÃ¢Â€Â vs fact checking to address misinformation. OurÃ‚Â recent studyÃ‚Â on hateful misinformation and elections on social media shows the dangers of tech companies rolling back approaches to misinformation.
Ã‚Â 
If all of this is the direction Meta is heading in 2025, it is a bad sign of what is to come for Jews and all marginalized people on their platforms.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/deadly-new-orleans-attack-fuels-conspiracy-theories-about-immigrants-israel,"The deadly New YearÃ¢Â€Â™s attack in New Orleans, Louisiana, left a city reeling and social media awash in hateful lies and conspiracy theories about immigrants, Israel and a government cover-up.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

In the early morning of January 1, 2025, 42-year-old Houston, Texas resident Shamsud-Din Jabbar, drove his car into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least fourteen people and injuring dozens more before he was shot and killed by police. While law enforcement is still investigating his motive, police reportedly found an ISIS flag in the truck and Jabbar, an Army veteran, wore military gear, including camouflage and body armor.Ã¢Â€Â¯

Ã‚Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #1: The suspect was a new immigrant who entered the U.S. via the Southern border

Early reports fueled by non-credible anonymous sources stated that the suspect had crossed into the U.S. via the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, two days before the attack. While law enforcement confirmed hours later that Jabbar was a U.S. citizen and Texas resident, this false narrative was weaponized to suggest the attack was the byproduct of lax immigration enforcement, fueling panic about border security.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

On X, ACT for America Ã¢Â€Â” an anti-Muslim organization founded by Islamophobic commentator Brigitte Gabriel Ã¢Â€Â” posted the suspectÃ¢Â€Â™s name while calling for Ã¢Â€Âœmass deportations NOW,Ã¢Â€Â despite the suspect having been born in the U.S.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

The reactions to the unfounded Eagle Pass claim highlight the consequences of misinformation that often follows breaking news events, and how unconfirmed information can sow panic and confusion.

FALSE NARRATIVE #2: The attack was a false flag orchestrated by Israel or Zionists to stoke Islamophobia and Ã¢Â€ÂœjustifyÃ¢Â€Â war in the Middle EastÃ‚Â 

Conspiracy theories blaming Israel and Zionists for terror attacks are not new; events such as 9/11, as well as more recent incidents like the ISIS-linked Crocus City Hall attack in March 2024, have also been falsely attributed to Israel. Mirroring past conspiratorial claims, some accused the Israeli government of Ã¢Â€ÂœcreatingÃ¢Â€Â ISIS, referring to the acronym as the Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraeli Secret Intelligence Service.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â

FALSE NARRATIVE #3: Powerful, nefarious Jews are to blame for the attack

Antisemitic influencers seized on the New Orleans attack to promote overtly hateful falsehoods about Jews, suggesting that the incident was related to Jewish Ã¢Â€Âœinfluence.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
On X, antisemitic propagandist Brother Nathanael used the New Orleans attack and the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, which occurred on the same day, to claim that there was Ã¢Â€Âœsomething jewy [sic] here.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â

Influencer Ã¢Â€ÂœLou Rage,Ã¢Â€Â who frequently posts antisemitic content, posted on X that the suspect had an Ã¢Â€Âœalternative Jewish name.Ã¢Â€Â Other popular antisemitic posts on X referred to ISIS as Ã¢Â€Âœjewish [sic] agent provocateursÃ¢Â€Â and suggested that Ã¢Â€Âœthe Jewish controlled mediaÃ¢Â€Â was influencing the investigation of the attack.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

X influencer Ã¢Â€ÂœLou RageÃ¢Â€Â refers to Ã¢Â€Âœalternative Jewish nameÃ¢Â€Â of suspect. Source: X

Blaming Jews at large for acts of terror and violence is common among antisemitic influencers and extremists, who see any global event as an opportunity to promote their hate and bigotry.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #4: The government is either hiding the truth about the attack, or coordinated the attack itself

Purveyors of hate and disinformation weaponized the New Orleans attack to promote anti-government conspiracy theories and undermine the legitimacy of the government.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Though the FBI has since indicated that they are investigating the attack as an act of terror, conspiracy theorists used law enforcementÃ¢Â€Â™s initial reticence to do so as evidence that the FBI was intentionally hiding evidence, such as the purported ISIS flag in the vehicle, from the public.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  On Telegram, far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec claimed the FBI Ã¢Â€Âœlied about it to the world.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Jack Posobiec alleges that FBI agents lied about JabbarÃ¢Â€Â™s ISIS flag. Source: Telegram

Some have pointed out that both Jabbar and Matthew Livelsberger Ã¢Â€Â” the suspect involved in the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas Ã¢Â€Â” were veterans, suggesting this common history is evidence that the attacks were an inside job by the U.S. military. A feature on far-right conspiracy theorist Alex JonesÃ¢Â€Â™ Infowars site alleged that the Biden administration was aware of the imminent attacks but allowed them to happen anyway.Ã‚Â  Others accused the government of being more directly responsible for the attack, posting the phrase, Ã¢Â€Âœthe CIA created ISIS.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â

Dear Friends,

As I reflect on the end of the long year that has been 2024, two words come to mind first. Ã¢Â€Â˜ChallengesÃ¢Â€Â™ and Ã¢Â€Â˜Community.Ã¢Â€Â™ Or possibly just Ã¢Â€Â˜good riddance.Ã¢Â€Â™ But before we turn the page, itÃ¢Â€Â™s important to reflect on the work that the ADL community did this year in the face of such upheaval. I am so grateful to our dedicated professional staff, our amazing volunteer leadership, our generous donors and everyone else who speaks up and shows up to fight hate for good in your neighborhood, online, on campus and everywhere that antisemitism and other forms of bigotry and extremism must not go unanswered.

We entered 2024 with the sobering realization that in the three months since the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, U.S. antisemitic incidents rose dramatically, foreshadowing a trend that would play out through the year. As I noted then, Ã¢Â€Âœthe American Jewish community is facing a threat level thatÃ¢Â€Â™s now unprecedented in modern history.Ã¢Â€Â

In January:

Addressing what would be one of the themes for the year -- the hostile campus climate -- ADL launched our Not On My Campus Hub with tools and resources for students, faculty, parents and alumni.

In February:

ADL and The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education against CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s Berkeley Unified School District for failing to take action to end nonstop bullying and harassment of Jewish students by peers and teachers since Oct. 7. This was part of a 2024 acceleration of ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s litigation efforts Ã¢Â€Â“ our work is having an impact on campus and in K-12 schools, as well as in the workplace, online and in anti-extremism work.

In March:

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s flagship event, Never Is Now, welcomed over four thousand attendees to learn, to connect, and to take action. This is a tremendous event with global experts in the fight against antisemitism and hate and a reminder that... letÃ¢Â€Â™s face it. No one can fight antisemitism alone. (We encourage you to join us March 3-4, 2025 for another extraordinary Never Is Now; click here to get our Early Bird rate before it expires in January.)
ADL launched our new ATLAS tool to provide a comprehensive picture of the state of antisemitism worldwide.
Authorities arrested Frankie Rizzello, a white supremacist, on felony charges thanks in part to ADL investigative work, which uncovered his identity and provided information to law enforcement.

In April:

The Countering Antisemitism Act was introduced. The bill, which would be the most far-reaching antisemitism initiative ever passed as national legislation, reflects substantial input from ADL; thousands of people across the ADL community also pushed hard to advocate for the bill. Sadly, it looks like this legislation will not be passed in 2024, but we will urge its approval again in 2025.
ADL released our annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents in the United States, and the numbers were appalling Ã¢Â€Â” the highest level recorded since ADL started tracking this data. This added up to an average of about one anti-Jewish incident every hour all year in 2023.
As one way to fight back against hate amid encampments and other protests that were widespread in the spring, ADL launched our first Campus Antisemitism Report CardÃ‚Â to help students, parents, alumni and others assess the schools they are interested in and to advocate for improvements. Schools have started to implement our recommendations, and we will keep updating the report card and pushing for schools to do better.

In May:

ADL launched our Campus Crisis Alert newsletter, which quickly became an invaluable resource for people concerned for Jewish students. (DonÃ¢Â€Â™t get the Campus Crisis Alert in your inbox? Click here to subscribe.)
I went to Israel to meet with Israeli leaders, with the families of hostages, and with others to provide support and report back to the ADL community.

In June:

Keeping an eye on campus, ADL filed a formal complaint against Jewish Voice for PeaceÃ¢Â€Â™s (JVP) political fundraising arm alleging multiple violations of campaign finance laws and regulations.
With the Paris Olympics approaching, ADL Israel met with IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s Olympic and Paralympic delegations to share best practices on how to handle incidents.

In July:

ADL and the firm Crowell & Moring filed a U.S. federal lawsuit as co-counsels on behalf of more than 125 plaintiffs against Iran, Syria and North Korea to hold them responsible for their role in 10/7.
U.S. Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt unveiled the Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism. ADL was proud to help shape this first-ever global framework with best practices to counter antisemitism.

In August:

As the 2024 Ã¢Â€Â˜proxy seasonÃ¢Â€Â™ of corporate shareholder meetings came to a close, ADL affiliate JLens highlighted our successful efforts to combat anti-Israel shareholder proposals and to address critical issues of online hate speech and cyberbullying, including at Amazon and defense contractor RTX Corporation.
Thanks in part to the advocacy of ADL volunteers across the U.S., the Department of Homeland Security allocated a historic $454.5M to the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. These grants fund security enhancements to synagogues and other houses of worship, along with other at-risk nonprofits.

In September:

ADL revealed that the Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL) that ADL partners on has received more than 650 requests for assistance from university students across the country who experienced antisemitic harassment, violence or discrimination. (ItÃ¢Â€Â™s now over 800 as we end the year.)
JLens issued a first-of-its-kind report showing that the largest university endowments could lose $33 Billion if they divest from from Israel: The report became a tool used to fend off BDS attempts targeting college endowments.
ADL joined as co-counsel in John Doe v. Intel Corporation, an employment discrimination lawsuit against Intel, marking the first time in recent history ADL has filed suit against a major Fortune 500 company for alleged antisemitic discrimination in the workplace.
ADL announced that our new Board Chair starting in January will be Nicole Mutchnik, a well-known community leader in Los Angeles.Ã‚Â 

In October:

The U.S. Department of the Treasury in a joint action with Canada, designated the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network as a sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. ADL shared intelligence about SamidounÃ¢Â€Â™s activities with Congress and the Administration and has been highly engaged in pushing for government action.
ADL launched a major new center, the Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education, to serve as a focal point for ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s work to ensure safe, welcoming learning environments for all, including Jewish students, faculty and staff.

In November:

After a soccer match in Amsterdam, there was horrific antisemitic violence in the streets as supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv were attacked by violent anti-Israel mobs in what seemed to be a coordinated attack. Responding to this modern-day pogrom, I flew to Europe to show support for the Dutch Jewish community and to tell political leaders that more must be done to protect Jews from this violent hatred. Enough is enough.
The 30th Anniversary ADL In Concert Against Hate featured stars like Ben Stiller, Sia and Eden Golan honoring Scooter Braun with the ADL Spotlight Award, as well as Kay Family Award recipients Dr. Mehnaz Afridi, Dr. Charles Chavis and Rosette Goldstein and Levenson Family Defender of Democracy Award honorees Noa Fay, Luda Isakharov and Einav Tsach.
In a sweeping settlement agreement in response to a federal Title VI complaint filed by ADL and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, Occidental College has agreed to take a series of steps to address and prevent antisemitism on campus.

In December:

An ADL-sponsored study found that Jewish American job candidates needed to send 24 percent more applications to receive the same number of positive first responses from prospective employers as Americans with Western European backgrounds when applying for the same job, and Israeli Americans needed to send 39 percent more applications.
ADL Israel launched the Druze Leadership Program,Ã‚Â with a goal of promoting a just and cohesive Israel.

During all of these unprecedented moments, ADL supporters like you were there, vigilant in rejecting antisemitism, supporting Israel in its time of need and finding ways to Fight Hate for Good. We thank you for joining with us in 2024.

Your support for ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s mission -- to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all -- has been vital this year and will be equally critical in 2025 and beyond.

Sincerely,
Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/parentcaregiver-toolkit-responding-2024-nais-pocc,"The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) People of Color Conference, held from December 4-7, 2024 in Denver, was intended to be the flagship of NAISÃ¢Â€Â™s commitment to equity and justice in teaching and learning for independent schools. However, one group of teachers and students was notably excluded from the conferenceÃ¢Â€Â™s stated goals: the Jews. Several speakers, including the keynote speaker, used extreme, biased anti-Israel rhetoric, including falsely accusing Israel of Ã¢Â€Âœgenocide,Ã¢Â€Â calling its creation Ã¢Â€Âœracist,Ã¢Â€Â referring to those killed in Gaza as Ã¢Â€Âœmartyrs,Ã¢Â€Â while downplaying the Hamas terrorist attack on 10/7. Jewish teachers and students in attendance reported feeling excluded and marginalized. Per one firsthand account, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe felt so unsafe that we tucked our Magen Davids (Jewish stars) inside our shirts as others glared and whispered.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL and several other leading groups in the Jewish community wrote to the head of NAIS expressing their outrage at what occurred during the conference. The NAIS President, Debra Wilson, thenÃ‚Â reached out to ""express my profound remorse over the divisive and hurtful rhetoric expressed on stage at last weekÃ¢Â€Â™s NAIS People of Color Conference in Denver. There is no place for antisemitism at NAIS events, in our member schools, or in society."" ADL appreciates both the expressions of remorse from Wilson and the outline of new steps being instituted to avoid future incidents involving speakers at NAIS events. While these steps are welcome, we remain hopeful that NAIS will take further action to educate its member schools on this type of rhetoric. Join our demand here.

If you are a parent or caregiver of a student who attends a NAIS-member independent school, you have the power to make your voice heard and affect positive change in your school community.

What can parents ask their schools to do?

Emphasize the Impact

If the school has not done so already, it should address the students and faculty who attended and were directly impacted by the antisemitic statements made at the conference which created a hostile environment for Jewish attendees.
Before reaching out to your school, consider reviewing ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s guidance, Championing Change: How Parents and Families Can Address Antisemitism in Schools. This guide walks parents and caregivers through ways to prepare for these conversations and gives examples of common incidents and what to do in response.
Make clear that this type of rhetoric was at odds with the purpose of the conference and the values of the school.
Explain why the rhetoric and slides used by the speakers was problematic, including the extreme, biased, and false anti-Zionist and anti-Israel rhetoric.
These guides can help those discussions:
Israel in the Curriculum
10 Ways to Have Conscientious Conversations on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
Questions, Complexities and Context: Insights into Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
In your conversation, itÃ¢Â€Â™s important to not discount the value and purpose of the PoCC and the otherwise enriching experiences that attendees had while also ensuring accountability and asking about the value of the conference for the school community.

Communication to the school community

If the school hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t already done so, it should send a communication to the entire school community making clear that antisemitism is not acceptable and share the steps the school will be taking going forward.
Prompt, intentional and specific communication with the school community makes a big difference. Statements from school leadership sets the tone for the community.
Communication should be timely; describe the nature of the incident, use thoughtful, inclusive language, and choose terms that respect how affected communities self-identify; denounce the incident and reaffirm your schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s values.
For additional guidance, see ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Responding to Bias Incidents in Middle and High Schools: Resources and Best Practices for School Administrators & Educators.

Review and adopt ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Best Practices for Combating Antisemitism in K-12 Schools

Clearly define antisemitism and ensure consistent application.
Educate students, teachers and community members about antisemitism, and ensure robust Holocaust education in school.
Clearly communicate and enforce all policies and protocols, including codes of conduct and anti-bullying, anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies, and ensure robust reporting mechanisms are in place.
Ensure that schools do not teach problematic content that amplifies antisemitism and delegitimizes/demonizes the State of Israel and its existence.
Speak out and take action when antisemitism takes place.
Ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for Jewish students.
Additional resources are available at ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Antisemitism in the Classroom Hub.

Elevate concerns to NAIS/pressure NAIS to take additional steps to address the issue

As an independent school and a member of the NAIS, your voice matters and you can join the chorus of voices urging NAIS to take the necessary steps to address antisemitism in schools. There are several sign-on letters circulating, or schools can send their own letter or otherwise make sure they are on the record making clear to NAIS that antisemitism has no place in our schools, our School Association or any programming.
Ensure that NAIS follows through on their commitment to better vet speakers and presentations for future conferences.
Commit to continued learning on understanding and combatting antisemitism.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Ã‚Â 

New York, NY, December 20, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ The School District of Philadelphia (SDP) has entered into a resolution agreement to take a series of steps to address repeated incidents of antisemitic harassment, bullying and discrimination in response to a federal civil rights complaint filed by ADL (the Anti-Defamation League).

Under theÃ‚Â terms of the settlement announced yesterday, SDP will undertake a series of initiatives toÃ‚Â ensure its compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when responding to allegations of harassment based on shared ancestry.Ã‚Â These initiatives, among others, include developing or revising reporting procedures for incidents of harassment, providing annual training to all administrators, faculty, and staff on Title VIÃ¢Â€Â™s prohibitions, administering climate assessments to all students grades 6-12, and providing age-appropriate informational programs for all 6th through 12th grade students district-wide to address discrimination.

This resolution agreement resolves the allegations raised by ADL, represented pro bono by the law firm Mayer Brown LLP, in aÃ‚Â complaint filed in July 2024 with the U.S. Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The complaint alleged that SDP knowingly allowed its schools to become Ã¢Â€Âœviciously hostileÃ¢Â€Â environments for Jewish students, while failing to address numerous incidents of antisemitic harassment, bullying, and discrimination.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are grateful for the Jewish students and parents who had the courage to speak out against the pattern of antisemitic harassment, abuse and bullying they were experiencing,Ã‚Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO.Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœIt is clear from the resolution that OCR identified multiple ways the SDP wholly failed to meet its Title VI obligations, and itÃ‚Â is our hope that this resolution will ensure the District embraces a long-overdue commitment to preventing Jewish students from being harassed and targeted in the future.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are proud to have stood alongside the ADL and a courageous group of Jewish families in calling out the severe and persistent harassment and discrimination facing Jewish students in the District over the last 14 months, said David Yolkut, Counsel, Mayer Brown LLP.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are gratified by the OCRÃ¢Â€Â™s thorough investigation and detailed findings, and hopeful for a brighter day for Jewish students and their families.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe welcome this decision as a vital acknowledgment of the challenges faced by students and their families and are hopeful that the district's commitment to implementing much-needed measures will create a more inclusive environment where Jewish students, and indeed all students, can feel safe and supported in Philadelphia schools, said Andrew Goretsky, EdD, Regional Director ADL Philadelphia. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe look forward to seeing these commitments realized, ensuring that all students experience a sense of belonging and security in our educational institutions.Ã¢Â€Â

According to the resolution agreement, The School District of Philadelphia has agreed to take the following actions to address and mitigate discrimination:

Issue and widely disseminate an anti-harassment statement.
Review its policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the Title VI prohibition on discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination based on a studentÃ¢Â€Â™s actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, revise its policies and procedures accordingly, and submit the revised policies and procedures for OCRÃ¢Â€Â™s approval.
Develop or revise its procedure for documenting each report or complaint of harassment.
Provide annual training to all administrators, faculty, and staff on Title VIÃ¢Â€Â™s prohibition of discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics.
Provide annual training to investigative staff to include a review of relevant district policies and procedures for complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics, including instructions on how to conduct and document reliable and impartial investigations, a description of the steps the district will take in response to harassing behavior, and a statement that a student or parent/guardian must be provided with notice of the steps the district is taking in response to the notification.
Provide an age-appropriate information program for all 6th through 12th grade students to address discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including harassment based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics.
Review its response to reports of discrimination and/or harassment on the basis of shared ancestry received during the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years to ensure that the district made a determination regarding whether the alleged conduct created a hostile environment within the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s education program or activities.
Conduct an audit of each school that serves any students in grades ranging from 6th through 12th grades to review the consistency of the application of and compliance with the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s policies and procedures regarding non-discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics for the 2024-2025 school year.
Administer a climate assessment to all students enrolled in the 6th through 12th grade after OCR reviews and approves the assessment, provide OCR with a report regarding its findings and steps taken in response to the findings, and promptly and fully address OCRÃ¢Â€Â™s feedback. And,
Retain or designate one or more consultants with expertise on the issue of harassment of students based on national origin, including shared ancestry, to assist in the development and delivery of training and the climate survey, and any other actions to prevent and address discrimination on the basis of shared ancestry.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin, including discrimination against Jews on the basis of their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding.Ã‚Â  Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful.

Since Oct. 7, ADL has filed several similar civil rights and legal complaints against other public school districts for creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, including theÃ‚Â Berkeley Unified School District and theÃ‚Â Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD).

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is Ã¢Â€Âœto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.Ã¢Â€Â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/71-jewish-parents-and-37-non-jewish-parents-surveyed-say-their-child,"New York, NY, December 23, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ Seventy-one percent of Jewish parents and 37 percent of non-Jewish parents surveyed reported that their child witnessed or experienced antisemitism in K-12 classrooms or through course materials, according to a survey released today by the ADLÃ‚Â (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Antisemitism Research (CAR). This represents more than a third of all parents.Ã‚Â 

These findings are part of a new ADL survey on attitudes of US adultsÃ‚Â and parentsÃ‚Â about K-12 education, which also found that more Jewish than non-Jewish parents reported their child experienced or witnessed antisemitic incidents in schools. These discrepancies highlight that Jewish students are more likely to report being targeted by and noticing antisemitism.

The findings also reveal a strong correlation between students' access to Holocaust and antisemitism education and their ability to recognize antisemitic incidents when they occur. In fact, parents whose children did not have access to antisemitism education were 46 percent less likely to report awareness of antisemitic bias on campus. This suggests that the reported rates of antisemitic or anti-Israel incidents are likely underestimated.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœAntisemitism in K-12 schools is an urgent national concern,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœThis escalation highlights the pivotal moment weÃ¢Â€Â™re in and the urgent need for Holocaust and antisemitism education. The time to act is now; future generations need to be equipped to prevent, recognize and address antisemitism.Ã¢Â€Â

Although most of those surveyed were public-school parents, a significant proportion were parents of K-12 students in private and charter schools. Just lastÃ‚Â week,Ã‚Â ADL expressed concern about antisemitic remarks at a recent conference of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) and that Jewish students and faculty attending the conference were subjected to a hostile environment.Ã‚Â 

CAR research further reveals that 86 percent of parents surveyed support offering antisemitism education, whether optional or mandatory, in their local school districts, and 88 percent support K-12 Holocaust education. Moreover, 52 percent of parents believe Holocaust education should be mandatory.

Despite this broad public backing, there is a significant gap in educational offerings. Currently, only 21 percent of parents report that their childÃ¢Â€Â™s school provides antisemitism education, and 30 percent have access to Holocaust education, with 15 percent receiving both.Ã‚Â 

These findings underscore the urgent need for school districts and policymakers to address the disconnect between public support and implementation. The ADL Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) is asking education leaders to take concrete steps to:

Integrate Antisemitism Awareness into Anti-Bias and Non-Discrimination Programs.
Mandate Holocaust and Genocide Education.
Eliminate Bias in Educational Materials.
Establish Strong Reporting Systems

Antisemitism is increasingly affecting younger populations as evidenced by the latestÃ‚Â ADL Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, which recorded 1,162 antisemitic incidents in non-Jewish schools in 2023, up from 495 incidents in 2022 - aÃ‚Â 135% increase. This surge reflects a broad trend across educational settings, public and private alike, as shown in this new study.Ã‚Â 

CAR is furthering investigating these alarming initial findings with several planned future studies designed to hone in more precisely on these results.

Methodology

In October 2024, CAR conducted a nationally representative survey of 817 American adults through the Ipsos Observer panel to understand views on antisemitism and Holocaust education, perceptions of anti-Jewish and other forms of prejudice in local school districts, and, in the case of parents, their childÃ¢Â€Â™s experience with antisemitism at school and in course materials. Respondents completed the Qualtrics-based online survey over a weeklong period, with fielding opening on Oct. 8 and closing on Oct. 16. The sample was balancedÃ‚Â to match 2023 American Community Survey (ACS)Ã‚Â benchmarks across race, ethnicity, age, and education level.

Of the 817 adults surveyed, 223 (27%) were parents of at least one current K-12 student. 96 (11.8%) of all respondents were Jewish. The margin of error for the survey was +/-4.2%.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/one-voice-many-countering-antisemitism-pennsylvania-community,"When signs of antisemitism began to emerge in her community, a mother reached out to ADL, having learned the power of community activism and ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s impact from her father.

On his first day of tennis practice, a freshman Jewish student at a high school in the suburbs of Philadelphia heard antisemitic Ã¢Â€ÂœjokesÃ¢Â€Â from the court next to him. He told his teammate, also Jewish, to knock it off, and that his words were antisemitic.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â 

Dorothy Potash, mom of the freshman and a resident of a town on the Main Line, learned of the incident when the tennis coach called to ask why her son left practice early. After hanging up, she approached her son, surprised he hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t brought it up.

Ã¢Â€ÂœMom, this is no big deal. This happens every day. Kids are always making antisemitic and racist jokes.Ã¢Â€Â

Dorothy asked for other examples and her son told her about the day a student asked how he did on a paper assigned by a Jewish English teacher. When he replied that he received an A, his peer accused him of benefiting from a Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish curve.Ã¢Â€Â During a fire drill, her son heard a student say to him that this is for the Jews who should be burning. There were group texts among sports teams with antisemitic messages and the Jewish students in the group seemed too afraid to speak up.

A few months earlier, there had been swastikas spraypainted on local signs in a neighboring Pennsylvania town. Dorothy learned that middle school students were also part of group texts with antisemitic imagery and language. She assumed that the school administrators may not be aware of what was going on.

In the spring of 2023, Dorothy decided she wanted to do something about this increase of antisemitism in a way that could make an impact.

She turned to ADL.

She reached out to a friend on the ADL Philadelphia Regional Board and asked how she could get involved. He helped initiate the process for her to join the board.Ã‚Â  In the interim, Dorothy reached out to several organizations that fight antisemitismÃ‚Â for resources on how to counter this hate. Everything she read spoke to the necessity of bringing multiple stakeholders from a community together in order to effectively fight antisemitism.

She relied on resources and data from ADL to guide her approach. She reviewed materials from AJC with sample language for municipal proclamations against antisemitism. Along with the support of a local Township Commissioner, she made a public statement at a commissionerÃ¢Â€Â™s meeting asking that her township pass a formal resolution against antisemitism and hate, as well as adopt the IHRA definition of Antisemitism. On July 17, 2023, her township issued a proclamation condemning antisemitism and all forms of hate. Both the regional directors of ADL and of AJC were present.

This was just the beginning.Ã‚Â 

Carrying on multi-generational engagement with ADL

ADL and its work fighting antisemitism was not new to Dorothy. Nearly 30 years ago, her father, who was the solicitor for many school districts, faced a situation where a school board president made antisemitic and inflammatory remarks at a board meeting.Ã‚Â  Her father called for an independent investigation into the incident. The then-chair of the ADL Philadelphia Regional Board made one of the first calls of support her father received. DorothyÃ¢Â€Â™s father later joined the board and Dorothy, as a young adult, joined one of the meetings. She never forgot the impactful support of the ADL.

She has since followed in her fatherÃ¢Â€Â™s footsteps and officially joined the ADL Philadelphia Regional Board in the spring of 2023.

Addressing the high school climate

After Dorothy learned about the prevalence of antisemitism in the middle and high schools, she reported the incidents to the ADL Philadelphia Regional Office, reaching out for resources and support.

Dorothy felt she wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be able to accomplish as much without Ã¢Â€Âœan organization with established credibility, trusted resources and people who know what they are doing.Ã¢Â€Â

Dorothy sharedÃ‚Â with the high school administration ADL resources on countering antisemitism, such as information on Echoes and Reflections,Ã‚Â a Holocaust education program led by ADL, theÃ‚Â USC Shoah Foundation and Yad Vashem, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, which provides statistics on antisemitic incidents across the country, including in K-12 schools, and ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s A Guide for Responding to School Sports-Related Bias Incidents.

After attending meetings with members of the ADL Philadelphia office, Dorothy said she Ã¢Â€Âœsoon realized the power of a quiet dialogue and the sharing of resources and facts, rather than raising voices and havoc on a soap box when it comes to dealing with complex issues and community leaders who represent many and multiple constituencies.Ã¢Â€Â

The ADL Philadelphia office has seen increased engagement by the high school in activities to fight antisemitism. For example, they attended the ADL Philadelphia Annual Youth Leadership Conference on December 11, which brought together in an educational forum 400 Jewish and non-Jewish students and 75 educators in-person and an additional 700 participants virtually from nearly 40 schools.

Raising community awareness

This was only the start of critically needed broader community efforts.

Soon after making her public statement, Dorothy found allies among the township commissioners and the Superintendent of Police, who offered to help bring additional community stakeholders together for further engagement.

Dorothy met with ADL staff andÃ‚Â  school leadership, law enforcement, members of the interfaith community and other regional Jewish organizations. Together with a fellow ADL Philadelphia Regional Board member,Ã‚Â  they co-founded the ADL Community Action Group Committee.Ã‚Â The Main Line Community Action Group (MLCAG), along with three other ADL community action groups, exist to create a community of neighbors to support one another, share resources and join in advocacy, and report local hate incidents to ADL.

The inaugural meeting of the ADL Main Line Community Action Group, May 2024.

At a regional board meeting, an ADL speaker talked about the importance of making a difference in local neighborhoods or communities in order to further ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s mission: ""to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all."" This resonated with Dorothy.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe current state of antisemitism across the world and across our country is both astounding and overwhelming.Ã‚Â  [ItÃ¢Â€Â™s] too much for one person or a small group of people to make an impact.Ã‚Â  However, that one person or small group of people can certainly have an impact on their block, in their neighborhood, in their town, in their larger communityÃ¢Â€Â¦that is the power of the ADL Community Action Groups.Ã¢Â€Â

Finding allies on-the-ground and online

Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Dorothy has noticed antisemitism manifesting in different ways, including the prevalence of misinformation and disinformation online. On December 11, she volunteered at the youth leadership conference, which addressed the spread of this false information.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe need to reengage with our allies, and we need to find new allies.Ã¢Â€Â

Dorothy said there just doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t seem to be any empathy or understanding and the best way to address this is through education which she says ADL has historically done incredibly well.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/unity-fields-what-you-need-know,"Unity of Fields (UoF), formerly Palestine Action U.S., is a radical far-left, anti-Zionist Ã¢Â€Âœdirect action networkÃ¢Â€Â that engages in and/or promotes aggressive, targeted protests and the defacement of property belonging to Jewish and non-Jewish organizations and individuals it considers supportive of Israel or Zionism or Ã¢Â€ÂœcomplicitÃ¢Â€Â in IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s alleged actions.

It has also called for ""material action"" that reads as violence in these contexts. This includes a quote-tweet of a February 2025 X post with a clipping from a 1988 newspaper story about a bomb planted in a park in Northern Ireland where an Israeli bowling team was scheduled to play. The clip was accompanied by the UoF caption: ""Expand your horizons of what 'Palestine solidarity' looks like. Solidarity is material action.""

Ã‚Â 

The groupÃ¢Â€Â™s stated mission is disrupting and Ã¢Â€Âœdismantling zionism [sic] and US imperialismÃ¢Â€Â through Ã¢Â€Âœmilitant direct actions.Ã¢Â€Â Unity of Fields openly celebrates the October 7, 2023 massacre in southern Israel and other terror attacks against Israelis and is explicitly supportive of terror organizations such as theÃ‚Â Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Yemen-basedÃ‚Â Ansar Allah (the Houthis), andÃ‚Â Hezbollah, andÃ‚Â Hamas terror leaders likeÃ‚Â Yahya Sinwar.

It has claimed Ã¢Â€Âœdirect actionsÃ¢Â€Â of vandalism and disruption to U.S. sites belonging to a leading Israeli weapons maker and has endorsed and publicized such acts against Jewish targets like a synagogue and businesses owned by Jews.

Ã‚Â 

The group regularly publishes Ã¢Â€Âœanti-imperialistÃ¢Â€Â propaganda, toolkits on Ã¢Â€Âœdirect actions,Ã¢Â€Â and posts from others including one that called for Ã¢Â€Âœdeath to amerikkka,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Âœglory to the martyrsÃ¢Â€Â and to hold a Ã¢Â€Âœknife to the throat of zionism [sic],Ã¢Â€Â submitted anonymously by email following firebombing attacks in California.

It also routinely shares content fromÃ‚Â Resistance News Network, a radical, antisemitic, anti-Zionist, English-language Telegram channel that promotes designated terror organizations, violence against Israel and anti-normalization with Ã¢Â€ÂœZionists.Ã¢Â€Â

Origins

Unity of Fields was formally launched in October 2023, shortly after the Hamas-led October 7 terror attack on southern Israel in which thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250, including children and elderly people.

The group was originally set up as Palestine Action U.S., the U.S. branch of anti-Zionist direct action network Palestine Action U.K. but changed its name to Unity of Fields in August 2024. In its announcement, the group said the new brand reflects its position as Ã¢Â€Âœa new front against the US EmpireÃ¢Â€Â to Ã¢Â€Âœbuild the international popular cradle of resistance,Ã¢Â€Â and called on supporters to send ""actions, reports, and analyses"" for distribution.

The name Ã¢Â€ÂœUnity of FieldsÃ¢Â€Â is a reference to the efforts of various Palestinian terrorist or Palestinian-aligned terrorist groups and organizations to coordinate activities and attacks since the May 2021 Israel-Hamas conflict. The group says the name comes from the Palestinian ""resistance"" Ã¢Â€Â” a euphemistic reference to the various terrorist groups responsible for violent attacks against Israel Ã¢Â€Â” and ""refers to the coordination between all the factions on the battlefield.""

The name change from Palestine Action U.S. to Unity of Fields occurred around the same time as the first wave of arrests by British authorities of Palestine Action U.K. activists following an attack in early August 2024 on a factory in the Bristol area belonging to Elbit Systems, a leading Israeli military technology company and defense contractor. U.K. authorities made subsequent arrests in the following months andÃ‚Â some of the U.K. group's leaders and members are facing charges like aggravated burglary, violent disorder and criminal damage with ""terrorist connection.Ã¢Â€Â

In a 2023 interview after the group was established, James Ã¢Â€ÂœFergieÃ¢Â€Â Chambers, who is involved with Unity of Fields, said the group was ""going to disrupt business and we're going to disrupt business constantly. We're going to use any means that we need to get that point across and to have the material effect that we want -- which is as H [Huda Ammori] said to shut the places down."" Ammori is a co-founder of Palestine Action U.K.

James ""Fergie"" Chambers gives an interview to a Tunisian news channel, October 2024. (Screenshot/YouTube)

Ã‚Â 

Chambers is a longtime American political activist, anÃ‚Â heir to the Cox family (of international conglomerate Cox Enterprises) and a self-proclaimed Ã¢Â€Âœprofessional revolutionary."" In the 2023 interview, he claimed Unity of Fields was an Ã¢Â€Âœaffinity networkÃ¢Â€Â that shares ideas and an Ã¢Â€Âœaffinity for direct action and an opposition to the occupation,Ã¢Â€Â but does not necessarily dictate activities to other groups.

Unity of Fields is not a registered organization, and its funding sources are unclear.

Activities and rhetoric

Unity of FieldsÃ¢Â€Â™ main activity is to encourage and promote direct actions such as defacement and vandalism of organizations, institutions, businesses, or homes of individuals it associates with Israel or Zionism.

Targets have included weapons manufacturerÃ‚Â Elbit Systems, companies like Starbucks and McDonald's, the office of an elected official, and establishments linked to Jews or Israelis.

The group invites submissions of Ã¢Â€Âœactions, writing, or propaganda in any media formatÃ¢Â€Â by members or followers of its network who film or otherwise document themselves engaging in vandalism, graffiti or destruction of property and distributes these to its followers on Telegram and/or X (Twitter), often with a caption applauding the action.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

Since October 7, 2023, anti-Israel activists have claimed credit for at least 72 so-called sabotages of infrastructure or vandalism of private and public property across the United States to protest American support for Israel. Unity of Fields has dutifully reported many of these acts on Telegram, where it hasÃ‚Â nearly 10,000 subscribers, and on X, where it hasÃ‚Â a growing audience of over 6,000 followers. The group also regularly reposts such incidents from other accounts. Unity of Fields previously also posted to an Instagram channel with over 75,000 followers before its profile was banned in October 2024.

For a brief period in the fall of 2023, the group claimed credit for ""direct actionsÃ¢Â€Â in Massachusetts against Elbit sites. On October 12, 2023, activists with the group blockaded the entrance to Elbit SystemsÃ¢Â€Â™ Cambridge, Massachusetts location, barring employees from entering, and vandalized the building with red paint.Ã‚Â The facility was vandalized twice more in the week that followed.

In November 2023, at ElbitÃ¢Â€Â™s Merrimack, New Hampshire facility, three activists were arrested on felony charges of rioting, conspiracy to commit criminal mischief, burglary, and conspiracy to falsify physical evidence. These were pled down to misdemeanor criminal mischief and criminal trespass. The sentence included 60 days in jail.Ã‚Â The activists involved in the incident were dubbed the Ã¢Â€ÂœMerrimack 3Ã¢Â€Â and their bail was paid by Chambers.

Since it was founded, Unity of Fields has also distributed various toolkits and materials to instruct followers on how and why to undertake disruptive Ã¢Â€Âœdirect actions,Ã¢Â€Â such as blockading entrances of companies, breaking and entering, spray-painting buildings with converted fire extinguishers (with instructions on how to convert fire extinguishers into spray paint devices) and causing harm to infrastructure.

A screenshot from a Unity of Fields post on Instagram sharing a guide on converting a fire extinguisher into a spray-painting device. (Screenshot/Instagram)

Ã‚Â 

Unity of Fields has also released several publications and statements that call for violence and escalation, including a May 2024 pamphlet titled Ã¢Â€ÂœFlood the Gates: EscalateÃ¢Â€Â that coincides with theÃ‚Â strategic Ã¢Â€ÂœescalationÃ¢Â€Â by anti-Israel activists on and off university campuses in the spring and summer of 2024. In the document, the group wrote that it was Ã¢Â€Âœinsincere to glorify the Palestinian resistance if, at the same time, we do not raise our own resistance here....We are not naÃƒÂ¯ve enough to think the revolution will come through ""peaceful"" means... without organized militancy.""

In a post ahead of the first anniversary of the October 7, 2023 attack, Unity of Fields referred to the terror massacre and the eruption of a Ã¢Â€Âœglobal anti-imperialist movementÃ¢Â€Â as a Ã¢Â€Âœgift to the world.Ã¢Â€Â

The group said its objective is to Ã¢Â€Âœexpand the number of people embodying resistance ideas, and to inspire them to take actions that deepen their commitment to those ideas.

The goal is to make anti-imperialism, pro-resistance, anti-capitalist, and pro-liberation ideas an irresistible material force in the world.Ã¢Â€Â

On the anniversary of October 7, it released a statement celebrating Ã¢Â€Âœthe Al-Aqsa FloodÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s official name for the October 7 massacre Ã¢Â€Â” and claimed that Ã¢Â€ÂœIf victory over the US Empire and its zionist [sic] proxy is possible, it will be because struggles against them have erupted all over the world Ã¢Â€Â” Bring the war home!Ã‚Â Two, three, many Al-Aqsa Floods!Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Earlier that month, on October 1, 2024, Unity of Fields celebrated a deadly terror attack in Tel Aviv that killed seven and injured several more, posting on Telegram. The group took a similarly gleeful tone when in September 2024, a gunman from Jordan killed three Israeli civilians at the Allenby Bridge border crossing, posting an image of a pistol and the outline of Israel and the Palestinian territories.

Ã‚Â 

In a December 2024 tweet, Unity of Fields engaged in the denial of rapes and sexual assaults that took place during the October 7 attack, quote-tweeting Ali Khamenei, the Iranian regime's supreme leader and writing, Ã¢Â€ÂœThe 10/7 rape atrocity propaganda, Ã¢Â€ÂœSaddamÃ¢Â€Â™s rape roomsÃ¢Â€Â, Ã¢Â€ÂœGaddafi supplies troops with endless viagra [sic] to encourage mass rapeÃ¢Â€Â, the lynching of Black men in the U.S. for their alleged Ã¢Â€Âœsexual predationÃ¢Â€Â of white women. This is part and parcel of the colonial playbook.Ã¢Â€Â

Encouragement of Vandalism and Other Ã¢Â€ÂœDirect ActionsÃ¢Â€Â against Jewish Targets

A small but significant segment of activity promoted by Unity of Fields includes the targeting of Jewish and Israeli or Zionist institutions, Jewish symbols, and Jewish Zionist individuals. By supportively sharing these incidents on its influential social media accounts, Unity of Fields helps to foster an environment where such activity becomes more normalized.

On September 5, 2024, it shared an Ã¢Â€Âœanonymous submissionÃ¢Â€Â where activists taped signs reading Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraelÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸ÂrapeÃ¢Â€Â, Ã¢Â€ÂœIsrael rapesÃ¢Â€Â, and Ã¢Â€ÂœIsrael a rapist colonyÃ¢Â€Â on a Ã¢Â€ÂœWe support Israel"" banner outside Congregation Beth El in Bethesda, Maryland.

That same month, in Brooklyn New York, vandals pulled down an LGBTQ flag with a Star of David. Unity of Fields posted a reel to its previously active Instagram page, with the text Ã¢Â€Âœtear down your local zionist [sic] flag.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

In Houston, Texas, multiple businesses owned by Jewish restaurateur Ben Berg wereÃ‚Â vandalizedÃ‚Â in mid-May 2024 with red paint and antisemitic fliers. Unity of Fields celebrated the vandalism, highlighting BergÃ¢Â€Â™s November 2023Ã‚Â participation in a fundraiserÃ‚Â organized by the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston to benefit nonprofits supporting Israelis displaced by the October 7 attack and war with Hamas.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

The group also publicized the defaced facade of theÃ‚Â Historic Blue Moon Hotel, the family business of a former IDF soldier, Bram Settenbrino, in September 2024.

Later that month, Unity of Fields published photos from activists at the University of Minnesota, with graffiti reading ""Zionists off campusÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœthe intifada is here.Ã¢Â€Â

In May 2024, the group posted to its thousands of Telegram subscribers to Ã¢Â€ÂœBesiege the Zionist embassies!Ã¢Â€Â with an image that contained the phrase Ã¢Â€Âœlong live the resistance.Ã¢Â€Â

Other Targets of Vandalism and Destruction of Property

Unity of Fields has also approvingly publicized destructive direct actions and targeted vandalism attacks on sites or offices belonging to shipping giant Maersk, construction and engineering manufacturer Caterpillar, Citibank, Bank of America and Starbucks, as well as city parking meters in Los Angeles, CA and subway fare readers in New York City.

In August 2024, it publicized the vandalism of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) office in Washington, D.C., writing a post that ended with theÃ‚Â inverted red triangle: Ã¢Â€ÂœEscalation needs to increase 10 fold. The Zionist Entity needs to feel the heat from all sides... Honor all the Martyrs and Glory to the Resistance from HÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ£s [sic], JeninÃ¢Â€Â™s Brigade, the Lions Den, HezBol, Yemen, and more. Ã°ÂŸÂ”Â».Ã¢Â€Â

In October 2024, the group posted photos of the vandalism to the New York office of Congressman Adriano Espaillat. In the post, Unity of Fields referred to Espaillat as someone who isÃ¢Â€Â bought and paid for by the Zionist lobbyÃ¢Â€Â though they claimed his ""action speaks louder than their blood money.""

That same month, activists also targeted the home of Gavin Kenneally, co-founder and CEO of Ghost Robotics in Philadelphia, painting ""Funded By Genocide"" across his garage, and ""I Make Killer Dogs"" on the sidewalk, throwing paint at the door and ring camera, and breaking windows. Ghost Robotics has supplied its technology to the Israeli military.

This is not the only incident involving Keanneally or Ghost Robotics. In July 2024, activists vandalized his townhome, and in November 2024, activists flooded it by turning on the water and letting it run. In October 2024, activists also vandalized Ã¢Â€ÂœPennovation,Ã¢Â€Â an innovation facility at the University of Pennsylvania that hosts a Ghost Robotics office.

Ã‚Â 

Unity of Fields has also been supportive of student vandals, having taken submissions from those who defaced the University of California PresidentÃ¢Â€Â™s office in May 2024, vandalism at Georgetown ahead of its annual homecoming weekend in September 2024, and at TuftÃ¢Â€Â™s Gantcher building.Ã‚Â 

In July 2024, Unity of Fields reposted a message from a Ã¢Â€ÂœSupport CommitteeÃ¢Â€Â for Casey Robert Goonan, a California resident who wasÃ‚Â charged and indicted by a grand jury for a series of arson incidents at UC Berkeley, asking followers to donate commissary funds. Goonan was charged with the firebombing of aÃ‚Â UC Berkeley police car and a truck. At the time of these incidents, when Unity of Fields was still going by Palestine Action U.S, it posted on Telegram that these actions were done Ã¢Â€Âœin solidarity with the resistance axis for Palestinian life, liberation, and total decolonization of the zionist [sic] occupied lands.Ã¢Â€Â

The post, submitted to the group, also read, Ã¢Â€ÂœBlessed is the flame that burns down the settler-plantation. Blessed are the rockets that will free thousands of prisoners held captive by the zionist settler entity and US colonizer police stateÃ¢Â€Â¦Knife to the throat of zionism. Death to amerikkka. Glory to the martyrs.Ã¢Â€Â

In May 2024, Unity of Fields republished a blog post from never sleep, an anarchist blog site. This post reads in part, Ã¢Â€Âœfour nights ago we set an NYPD bus on fire in Brooklyn as a peaceful protest against the cops for attacking anti-genocide demonstrators and their repression of protestors of Cop City.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-commends-congress-prioritizing-investigation-antisemitism,"New York, NY, December 19, 2024Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the House Republican leadershipÃ¢Â€Â™s report concluding their investigation into the alarming surge of antisemitism since HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s terrorist attack on October 7, 2023.

The committeeÃ¢Â€Â™s investigation found that several universities failed to stop antisemitism on their campuses, likely violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Additionally, the report found that several American-based tax-exempt organizations may have funneled American taxpayer dollars to designated terrorist organizations.

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO, issued the following statement:

We applaud Congress for continuing to exercise its oversight authority to investigate antisemitism on college campuses and whether American taxpayer funding is supporting terrorist organizations. We remain committed to continuing to work with Speaker Mike Johnson and Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to fight antisemitism in the 119th Congress.

The Staff ReportÃ‚Â on Antisemitism shines a light on many of the issues ADL has been sounding an alarm on for the past year.

The report calls on universities to recognize that discrimination against Zionists in an unacceptable antisemitic civil rights violation. College administrators have the responsibility to protect their students Ã¢Â€Â“ yet they too often have failed to enforce their own policies and codes of conduct, frequently allowing offenders to face little to no accountability or disciplinary action.

The report also highlights that fiscal sponsors cannot be permitted to knowingly provide or facilitate the provision of material support to U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations. ADL has been tracking the Alliance for Global Justice and American Muslims for Palestine, the case studies in this report and testified on this topic before the Ways and Means Committee earlier this year.

We were pleased to see OFACÃ¢Â€Â™s designation of Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network as a sham charity and urge the incoming Administration to ensure taxpayer money is not used to fund U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations.

Congress must take swift action to protect the Jewish community on campus and beyond.Ã‚Â  We will continue to advocate for passage of the Antisemitism Awareness Act and the Countering Antisemitism Act to give government the tools to more effectively combat the antisemitism crisis this report documents. In order to ensure the Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s Office for Civil Rights can protect studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ rights on safety on campus, Congress must ensure that it hasÃ‚Â sufficient resources.Ã‚Â As a crucial pillar in the global fight against terrorism, we urge the Senate to pass the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act with strengthened due process protections.

Through the partnership, ADL will provide JGO with resources, specialized training for staff and interns, educational opportunities, enhanced antisemitism reporting tools for graduate students, and co-facilitated webinars for students and alumni.

Ã¢Â€ÂœStudents are facing horrific levels of antisemitic harassment on campus, so this partnership could not come at a more important moment for Jewish students and those moving into the workforce,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are seeing a rise in antisemitism on grad school campuses around the country, and recognize the unique work that JGO is doing to support Jewish grad students during these challenging times. By equipping JGO students with the necessary tools and resources to counter antisemitism, we are empowering the next generation of Jewish leaders to stand up against hate.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœAt JGO, we recognize the unique challenges and opportunities that Jewish graduate students face,Ã¢Â€Â said Rabbi Dave Sorani, JGO CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are proud to partner with the ADL to ensure that these students have the support they need to thrive in their academic journeys and beyond. This partnership underscores our unwavering commitment to fostering vibrant and resilient Jewish communities on grad school campuses, where future leaders are not only shaped academically but are also being empowered to embrace their Jewish identity proudly. Through this collaboration, we will work with the ADL to provide critical resources and programming to equip Jewish grad students with the tools they need to navigate and confront antisemitism effectively, stand up for themselves, and advocate for the broader Jewish community.Ã¢Â€Â

This partnership comes as antisemitic incidents in the U.S. have reached historic levels, including a 500-percent increase on college campuses since Oct. 7, 2023. And it comes at a time when discrimination against Jewish job candidates is rising: A recentÃ‚Â ADL survey found that Jewish American job candidates need to send 24 percent more applications to receive the same number of positive first responses from prospective employers as Americans with Western European backgrounds when applying to the same role.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/hayat-tahrir-al-sham-extremist-record-and-regional-ambitions-syrias-new-rulers,"On November 27, 2024, Syrian rebel groups launched a major offensive against the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. Within days, forces led by Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), and supported by the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army and a range of anti-Assad militias, had taken Aleppo and Hama. On December 8, 2024, the rebel forces took Damascus, forcing Assad to flee the country. The HTS leadership quickly assumed control of government institutions, appointed an interim prime minister, and declared itself the de facto government of Syria.

HTS is designated by the US, UK, Canada and the United Nations as a terrorist organization. It emerged from the Al-Qaeda offshoot in Syria, the Nusra Front. HTS, in both its current form and as Jabhat Al-Nusra, has been accused of mass casualty attacks against civilian targets, including suicide bombings. They have also engaged in torture, as well as the repression, kidnapping and killing of religious and cultural minorities including Christians, Druze, Alawites and other Shia minorities, Kurds and other Sunni Muslims who do not subscribe to their extremist interpretation of Islam.

The leader of HTS, Abu Muhammad Al-Jolani Ã¢Â€Â“ who has recently abandoned his nom de guerre and started using his real name Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa Ã¢Â€Â“ claims to have been radicalized by the Second Intifada, before traveling to Iraq in 2003 to join international jihadist militias. From there, Al-Jolani joined ISIS and later Jabhat Al-Nusra. Al-Jolani is wanted by the U.S government Ã¢Â€Â“ which is offering a $10 million reward Ã¢Â€Â“ for orchestrating multiple terrorist attacks across Syria, and for kidnapping large numbers of Kurds and killing 20 residents of a Druze village.

Since before taking power in Syria, HTS has attempted to reform its image, mainly by claiming to have broken ties with Al-Qaeda. However, Al-Jolani has never actually disavowed his oath to Al-Qaeda, and even thanks it for Ã¢Â€Âœunderstanding the need to break ties.Ã¢Â€Â In addition, and despite these claims, HTS maintains ties to a wide range of regional Al-Qaeda affiliates. HTS also claims to be tolerant of minorities as part of efforts aimed at domestic state building within Syria.

However, HTS' claims of tolerance, which appear to be crafted for Western audiences, are at odds with several key statements made by the HTS leadership in Arabic catering to the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s core constituencies, indicating that the HTS continues to subscribe to an extremist worldview and has wider regional aims which pose direct threats against Israel.

Examples of HTSÃ¢Â€Â™s Anti-Israel Views:

On October 9, 2023, HTS published a letter congratulating Hamas for the October 7 attacks.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.0, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Ã‚Â 

New York, NY, December 11, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), American Jewish Committee (AJC), Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) and Prizmah: Center for Jewish Day Schools today expressed Ã¢Â€Âœdeep concernÃ¢Â€Â about remarks at a recent conference of the National Association of Independent Schools where several speakers used their time to accuse Israel of genocide and used extreme, biased anti-Israel rhetoric, including downplaying the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

In aÃ‚Â letter to the president of NAIS, the Jewish groups expressed concern that Jewish students and faculty attending the NAIS People of Color Conference were subjected to a hostile environment of extremely biased anti-Israel and antisemitic remarks time and again by multiple speakers, and had no choice but to watch as their peers applauded those tropes.

Ã¢Â€ÂœIt is alarming that a conference supposedly committed to addressing issues of inclusivity and embracing diversity was turned into a vehicle to spread baseless, one-sided and hateful views against Israel and the Jewish people,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe believe the organization owes its Jewish students and faculty an apology. The NAIS needs to do a better job at selecting speakers and ensuring that Jewish voices are not being marginalized.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe were horrified to hear what transpired at the NAIS People of Color Conference (PoCC),Ã¢Â€Â said AJC CEO Ted Deutch. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe must not tolerate any antisemitic rhetoric or exclusion and marginalization of Jewish identity in any education space. We are heartened by our conversations with NAIS leadership since learning what transpired and look forward to continuing to create and strengthen educational environments that refuse to normalize antisemitism in any form, are inclusive of Jews and Jewish identity, and are rooted in critical thinking, viewpoint diversity, and fact-based inquiry.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe cannot allow civic and educational organizations such as NAIS, which promise to promote safety and inclusion for students and educators alike, to become platforms for antisemitism,""Ã‚Â said Jewish Federations of North America President and CEO Eric D. Fingerhut. ""If educators whose job it is to ensure a hate-free learning environment are themselves being exposed to hate, we cannot hope to make things better for the Jewish students being confronted with antisemitismÃ‚Â everyÃ‚Â day.Ã¢Â€Â

Prizmah CEO Paul Bernstein shared, Ã¢Â€ÂœMany Jewish day schools and yeshivas in the Prizmah Network are actively involved in NAIS, and this has been a deeply hurtful and challenging time for our schools as we all struggle to understand how this could happen and why it has not been addressed.Ã¢Â€Â

According to participants, various speakers, including the keynote speaker, Dr. Suzanne Barakat, presented biased one-sided views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, erased the millennia-old connection between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel, and flattened Jewish identity by excluding MENA Jews.

In the letter, the groups call on independent schools to Ã¢Â€Âœchampion nuanced and fact-based teaching of history and current affairsÃ¢Â€Â noting that Ã¢Â€Âœstudents should learn that international conflicts are complex and easy answers and accusations are rarely a panacea.Ã¢Â€Â

As the situation in Syria continues to evolve, it is crucial that the international community works to ensure that Syria emerges as a stable and inclusive nation committed to peaceful coexistence with its neighbors.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

While the end of the Assad familyÃ¢Â€Â™s brutal dictatorship is a welcome development for the Syrian people and the region, we are very concerned about the role of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - a jihadist, US and UN designated terrorist group that traffics in overt antisemitism - will play in Syria moving forward. Despite HTSÃ¢Â€Â™s recent efforts to rebrand their organization as a moderate force, its ideology remains steeped in extremism and anti-Israel sentiment.Ã‚Â

Applying for a job is hard.

Whether youÃ¢Â€Â™re already employed or not, whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s your first job out of school or youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been in the workforce for decades, it takes time, it takes energy, and it takes courage.

Candidates will pore over their resumÃƒÂ©s, practice for interviews, ask trusted friends and mentors how to put their best self forward.

Discrimination against Jewish job applicants:

But it turns out the name atop that resumÃƒÂ© sadly can still, in the 21st century, be a liability for Jews.

ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the finding of a new landmark study from the Anti-Defamation League on discrimination in the job market against Jewish and Israeli Americans.

For this study, ADL asked a leading labor economist to conduct a field experiment submitting applications in response to administrative-assistant job postings using resumÃƒÂ©s that were identical except for specific characteristics, such as the applicantÃ¢Â€Â™s name.

The researcher sent out 3,000 applications this year for jobs in 23 cities.

Group applied for jobs using Jewish names, prior employers Ã¢Â€Â” what they found was troubling.

UCLA official put Jewish applicants on Ã¢Â€Â˜no hire list,Ã¢Â€Â™ complaint claims

By using names that suggested applicants were Jewish American, Israeli American or American with Western European backgrounds, the researcher was able to determine that individuals with Jewish- or Israeli-sounding names like Ã¢Â€ÂœRebecca CohenÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœLia AvrahamÃ¢Â€Â would need to send many more applications than someone with a less ethnic sounding name such as Ã¢Â€ÂœKristen MillerÃ¢Â€Â in order to receive a positive response.

How many more?

The survey showed that the fictional Rebecca would need to send 24% more applications, and fictional Lia 39% more, to receive the same number of positive first responses from a prospective employer.

Overall, the positive response rate was 3.4% lower for resumÃƒÂ©s with Jewish-American-sounding names and 4.9% lower for Israeli-Americans compared to those suggesting other backgrounds, such as Italian or Irish.

These are not just numbers.

This is groundbreaking evidence of serious antisemitic discrimination in the job market.

And letÃ¢Â€Â™s not fool ourselves.

The findings of this study arenÃ¢Â€Â™t an aberration Ã¢Â€Â” they come amid a climate of unaddressed antisemitism in our country and of the vile antisemitic and anti-Zionist campaigns weÃ¢Â€Â™ve witnessed since Oct. 7, 2023.

The hateful rhetoric weÃ¢Â€Â™ve been confronted with for more than a year has real-world consequences, and we need to face it as a country and as a people.

We already knew that some Jewish people were changing their names on their doors, on delivery or navigation apps and elsewhere.

We knew that some people had started removing their kippahs or Stars of David in certain places to avoid harassment.

We also learned through our latest Online Hate and Harassment Survey that 41% of Jewish people changed their online behavior in the past year to avoid being recognized as Jewish.

None of this is acceptable.

IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been thinking a lot about all the Rebecca Cohens, Lia Avrahams and other Jewish people I know and how many of them may have wondered why, despite their qualifications and motivation, they were never called back for a position they dreamed of and thought they were qualified for.

On top of antisemitic incidents reaching record numbers and growing antisemitic beliefs, this study illustrates the very real need for employers, legislators and civil-rights officers to take anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli prejudice more seriously to ensure a workplace that works for everyone.

Federal labor law prohibits discrimination against a person in hiring decisions based upon their race, religion or national origin, and this should not be a high standard to uphold.

IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been thinking about those who did think about it because they had a hunch, or those who may have used a maiden name or another name for that reason.

But hereÃ¢Â€Â™s the thing: While you can wordsmith a work experience on a resumÃƒÂ© or an introduction email, you canÃ¢Â€Â™t easily wordsmith your name.

During the Jewish immigration boom in the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants sometimes would choose American-sounding names at Ellis Island to make their path to full integration easier.

One would have hoped that in todayÃ¢Â€Â™s more tolerant world, hiding your religion or identity was a thing of the past.

This survey now gives us pause.

Further, Israeli Americans needed to send 39 percent more applications, indicating substantial discrimination.

For this study, leading labor economist Bryan Tomlin, PhD, independentlyÃ‚Â conducted a field experiment applying online for administrative assistant job postings using resumÃƒÂ©s that were identical except for specific characteristics, including names, that signal if the applicants were Jewish American, Israeli American, or American with Western European backgrounds.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWithout the benefit of a study of this kind, it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove adverse treatment in the labor market based on oneÃ¢Â€Â™s religion or cultural identity,Ã¢Â€Â said Tomlin. Ã¢Â€ÂœThis study shows that Jewish and Israeli Americans may be missing out on job opportunities just because of their identity, not their qualifications, and it provides a start toward quantifying some of these more subtle but still harmful symptoms of antisemitism.Ã¢Â€Â

Tomlin conducted a pre-registered, large sample, field experiment, sending 3,000 inquiries to administrative assistance job postings across the United States between May 2024 and Oct. 2024 using identical email text and resumÃƒÂ©s that differed only in (a) the name of the applicant Ã¢Â€Â“ selected to Ã¢Â€ÂœsoundÃ¢Â€Â Jewish, Israeli, or Western European Ã¢Â€Â“ and (b) resumÃƒÂ© signals of likely Jewish, Israeli, or Western European background. This methodology follows an approach similar to that utilized by other correspondence-based field experiments in the labor market.

Federal and state authorities have arrested individuals in seven different incidents on charges related to five unsuccessful plots and two actual attacksÃ‚Â in the past year. At least three of these incidents targeted Jewish or Israeli individuals, institutions or businesses.

Perpetrators in two incidents were successful in causing serious harmÃ¢Â€Â”including a shooting injury against a Jewish man on his way to synagogue in Chicago, IL, on Oct. 26, 2024, and damaging of an energy facility.

""The rise in Islamist extremist terror incidents in the United States is deeply troubling and compounds an already complex extremist landscape,"" said Oren Segal, Vice President of the ADL Center on Extremism (COE). ""This year, which has been marked by support for and glorification of terrorist organizations at anti-Israel demonstrations across the country, the increase in terrorist plots and attacks serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by these groups and their ideologies.""

While Islamist terror incidents were commonÃ¢Â€Â”and sometimes quite deadlyÃ¢Â€Â”in the 2010s, due in large part to the rise of ISIS, they decreased considerably by the end of the decade. Between 2021 and 2023, the COE tracked only six Islamist-related terror incidents in the U.S., compared to 30 incidents with far-right perpetrators and five incidents with far-left or other perpetrators within that same timeframe.

In 2024, COE has tracked seven different terror incidents connected to Islamist extremism, compared to six incidents tied to far-right extremism and four incidents related to far-left or other extremism. The Islamist-related incidents stemmed from a variety of motivations, from a desire to support ISIS or its offshoots (such as ISIS-K in Pakistan and Afghanistan) to anger over the war in Gaza that began following the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks against Israel.

Incidents included both homegrown Islamist extremists inspired to commit a violent act in the United States and people who attempted to enter the U.S. to commit a terrorist attack.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/islamist-terror-incidents-targeting-us-increase-2024,"January 2, 2025, Update: In the month since this article was originally published, at least two more Islamist-related terror incidents have occurred in the United States, including the deadly vehicular attack in New Orleans, Louisiana, on New YearÃ¢Â€Â™s Day 2025, which killed 14 people and wounded dozens more.

The New Orleans incident was the deadliest Islamist terror attack in the United States since the 2016 shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people. Islamist extremists have attempted a number of vehicular attacks in recent years (inspired by a deadly attack in France in 2016 using this tactic). Most were prevented before they could be carried out or otherwise failed to cause mass deaths. However, in 2017, Sayfullo Saipov drove a rental truck down a bike path in New York City, killing eight people and injuring 12 more.

New Orleans, Louisiana, January 1, 2025.Ã‚Â Shamsud-Din Jabbar of Houston, Texas, bypassed barriers to drive a rental truck into a crowd of New YearÃ¢Â€Â™s celebrators on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, an attack that left 14 people dead and dozens more injured. The suspect had an ISIS flag on his vehicle and reportedly made videos prior to the attack in which he claimed to have joined ISIS. Jabbar was fatally shot by police after exiting the vehicle and opening fire, wounding two officers in the exchange. Shortly afterwards, police found explosive devices in the vicinity of the attack, possibly intended to target first responders.Ã‚Â 
Fairfax, Virginia, December 17, 2024. FBI agents arrested an Egyptian citizen and George Mason University student, Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan, on a charge of demonstrating how to manufacture an explosive with intent to murder internationally protected persons. According to authorities, Hassan had praised Osama bin Laden and boasted about spreading Islamist propaganda online, including an ISIS-related video calling for the killing of Jews. Hassan also allegedly plotted his own mass-casualty attack targeting the Israeli consulate in New York City.

These recent incidents, as well as the other plots and attacks from 2024 detailed below, highlight that Islamist terrorismÃ¢Â€Â”whether homegrown or coming from abroadÃ¢Â€Â”is still a threat to the United States. The dangers of Islamist extremism and terrorism cannot be ignored, even as the country also faces other significant terror threats, such as white supremacist mass shooters.

Islamist terror incidents targeting the United States increased in 2024 after several years of reduced activity, with federal and state authorities arresting individuals in seven different incidents on charges related to five unsuccessful plots and two actual attacks. Incidents included both homegrown Islamist extremists purportedly inspired to commit a violent act in the United States and people who attempted to enter the U.S. allegedly to commit a terrorist attack.

While Islamist terror incidents were common in the United StatesÃ¢Â€Â”and sometimes quite deadlyÃ¢Â€Â”in the 2010s, due in large part to the rise of the terrorist organization ISIS (the Islamic State or IS) and its efforts to recruit fighters to its ranks in Syria and Iraq and spread violence in other countries, they decreased considerably by the end of the decade. This was due to successful military action by the U.S. and other countries that greatly degraded ISIS. Between 2021 and 2023, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) tracked only six Islamist-related terror incidents in the U.S., compared to 30 incidents with far-right perpetrators and five incidents with far-left or other perpetrators within that same timeframe.

During these years, U.S. authorities still regularly made arrests linked to Islamist extremism, but most of these involved people providing material support, such as money, to terrorist groups abroad, or attempting to travel outside the U.S. to join such groups. Such arrests continue today; in November 2024, for example, Anas Said, a Houston man, wasÃ‚Â indicted for providing material support and resources to ISIS because of his alleged involvement in the creation of numerous ISIS propaganda videos and images.Ã‚Â According to authorities, Said also unsuccessfully tried several times to travel abroad to join Islamist terror groups and even considered the possibility of conducting a violent act in the U.S., going so far at one point as to research local military recruiting facilities and Jewish targets, though he did not actually plot an attack.

Other people were also purportedly motivated by Islamist extremism to plot or commit violence in 2024. So far this year, COE has tracked seven different terror incidents seemingly connected to Islamist extremism, compared to only six incidents tied to far-right extremism and four incidents related to far-left or other extremism. These incidents seemingly stemmed from a variety of motivations, from a desire to support ISIS or its offshoots (such as ISIS-K in Pakistan and Afghanistan) to anger over the war in Gaza that began following the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks against Israel. Several of the terror incidents involved relatively unsophisticated perpetrators whose desire to conduct some sort of operation outpaced their resources or ability to carry one out.

However, perpetrators in two incidents were successful in causing serious harmÃ¢Â€Â”including a shooting injury and the damaging of an energy facility.

Incidents:

Chicago, Illinois, October 26, 2024. Authorities arrested a 22-year-old Chicago resident, Sidi Mohammed Abdullahi, on 14 felony countsÃ‚Â following a shooting attack against a Jewish man on his way to synagogue services. Abdullahi reportedly shot the victimÃ¢Â€Â”who survived the attackÃ¢Â€Â”then lingered at the scene for a half-hour to open fire on law enforcement and first responders coming to the scene of the shooting. Police returning fire seriously injured, but did not kill, Abdullahi. Following days of investigation, authorities subsequently added stateÃ‚Â hate crime and terrorism charges, saying that evidence from the attackerÃ¢Â€Â™s phone revealed that the shooting was planned and deliberately targeted Jews.
Peoria, Arizona, October 18, 2024. Police in ArizonaÃ‚Â arrested a teenager on state charges of terrorism and conspiracy to commit terrorism, alleging that he had been inspired by ISIS to plot an attack on a Phoenix Pride parade, using a remote-controlled drone with explosives. The juvenileÃ¢Â€Â”who was charged as an adultÃ¢Â€Â”had allegedly purchased the chemicals needed to make an explosive.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, October 7, 2024. Federal authoritiesÃ‚Â arrested an Afghan national, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, on charges of conspiring and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or federal crime of terrorism. Tawhedi had allegedlyÃ‚Â affiliated himself with ISIS-K, the branch of ISIS based in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and sought to commit a mass casualty attack in the U.S. on Election Day. Tawhedi and a juvenile accomplice were arrested while allegedly trying to purchase assault-style weapons and ammo for their attack from undercover FBI agents. French authoritiesÃ‚Â arrested two of TawhediÃ¢Â€Â™s brothers on similar charges in that country.
New York, New York, September 6, 2024. As part of a two-country investigation, Canadian authoritiesÃ‚Â arrested a Pakistani citizen, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, who was trying to cross the border into the U.S., allegedly as part of aÃ‚Â planned mass shooting against a Jewish target in Brooklyn, in support of ISIS. According to authorities, Khan boasted that his attack would be the ""largest attack on U.S. soil since 9/11."" A federal indictment in the Southern District of New York charged Khan with one count of attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization.
Orlando, Florida, July 11, 2024. Federal authorities arrested Hashem Younis Hashem Hnaihen, a Jordanian living in Orlando, Florida,Ã‚Â charging him with destruction of an energy facility and four counts of threatening to use explosives. According to prosecutors, Hnaihen targeted businesses he believed were supportive of Israel.Ã‚Â Beginning in June 2024, he allegedly vandalized several Orlando-area businesses and facilities, including a propane gas distribution depot, leaving ""warning letters"" at the premises that included threats and demands. Hnaihen also allegedly attacked a solar power facility, causing more than $700,000 in damage.
New York, New York, August 6, 2024. In an international terrorist incident, federal authorities arrested a Pakistani citizen, Asif Merchant, in connection with an alleged plot toÃ‚Â conduct political assassinations in the U.S. Merchant allegedly traveled to New York in April 2024 to hire hitmen to carry out the killings but ended up paying a $5,000 advance to undercover law enforcement officers posing as potential assassins. Federal authorities say Merchant had ties to Iran. He was charged with one count of murder for hire, but in September 2024 federal prosecutorsÃ‚Â filed a new indictment that also charged him with attempting to carry out an act of terrorism.
Coeur dÃ¢Â€Â™Alene, Idaho, April 6, 2024.Ã‚Â  Federal authoritiesÃ‚Â arrested Alexander Scott Mercurio on charges of providing material support to a terrorist organization. Mercurio allegedly plotted toÃ‚Â attack local churches on behalf of ISIS, in a bid to kill as many people as possible before being killed by law enforcement or dying by suicide. The 18-year-old Mercurio allegedly told law enforcement that he had previouslyÃ‚Â had white supremacist views but later switched to supporting ISIS.

The surge in Islamist extremist terror incidents in 2024 is troubling, especially as the terrorist threat from other forms of extremism, such as accelerationist white supremacists, has not decreased.

Moreover, potential future U.S. policies such as aÃ‚Â renewal of the so-called Ã¢Â€ÂœMuslim banÃ¢Â€Â as well asÃ‚Â mass deportations could provide further ammunition for Islamist extremist propagandists abroad to incite violence within the United States. U.S. authorities must be sure to guard against the threat of terrorism from all potential sources, whatever the cause or ideology.","[2, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.1, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Accelerationism is an ideology within some segments of the white supremacist movement that promotes violent actions and sabotage as a means to accelerate the perceived inevitable collapse of society, allowing followers to establish a white ethno-state in the aftermath.
The modern iteration of white supremacist accelerationism gained traction in extremist spaces in the 2010s following the revival of neo-Nazi James MasonÃ¢Â€Â™s Siege essays from the 1990s.
White supremacist accelerationism has inspired multiple terrorist plots and attacks in countries around the world, with most of them targeting Jews, Muslims, immigrants, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community.
Accelerationist adherents generate online propaganda that venerates past far-right killers and encourages people to emulate them, as well as manuals and other materials designed to provide guidance on targets and tactics.

Background

Accelerationism is an extremist belief rooted in some segments of the white supremacist movement that society is irredeemable, and that acts of violence and destabilization can Ã¢Â€ÂœaccelerateÃ¢Â€Â a perceived inevitable societal collapse and usher in a white ethnonationalist state in the chaotic aftermath.

The ideology originated with the 1990s writings of an American neo-Nazi and saw a resurgence in the mid-2010s with the rise of theÃ‚Â alt-right extremist movement. Accelerationist adherents subscribe to a mix of racist, antisemitic, Islamophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs and conspiracy theories.

Accelerationist white supremacists may be hostile to other white supremacist groups and adherents who may not openly embrace violence as a tactic.

Since the late 2010s, white supremacist accelerationism has inspired dozens of terrorist plots and attacks across the world, with most targeting Jews, Muslims, immigrants, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community. Some have also targeted critical infrastructure to sow chaos.

Origins

The beliefs and attitudes behind modern white supremacist accelerationism largely originated with American neo-NaziÃ‚Â James Mason, a relatively minor figure in the white supremacist community in the 1970s, who was a member of George Lincoln RockwellÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â American Nazi Party and a later splinter group, theÃ‚Â National Socialist Liberation Front (NSLF). During his time as a member of the NSLF in the 1980s, Mason wrote and edited the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s monthly newsletter,Ã‚Â Siege. The publicationÃ¢Â€Â™s contents included a wholesale embrace of violence against perceived enemies anchored in fascist ideology, the promotion of guerrilla warfare against Ã¢Â€Âœthe system,Ã¢Â€Â praise for the murders committed by Charles MansonÃ¢Â€Â™s followers as Ã¢Â€Âœdirect action,Ã¢Â€Â and the glorification of Adolf Hitler.

In 1992, Mason compiled his writings from Siege into a single volume under the same name.Ã‚Â For many years, these had little influence. However, the rise of the alt-right in the mid-2010s brought a wave of new, mostly younger recruits into the white supremacist movement, some of whom discovered MasonÃ¢Â€Â™s writings, and began spreading them, especially on the now-defunct fascist social networking forum Iron March.

These new Mason fans, many of them neo-Nazis, laid the foundation for what they dubbed Ã¢Â€ÂœSiegeculture (Siegekultur),Ã¢Â€Â a philosophy and subculture centered around MasonÃ¢Â€Â™s writings.

Ã‚Â 

Iron March, which operated from 2011 to 2017, was instrumental in the formation of early white supremacist accelerationist networks. Members from this forum would go on to create the first neo-Nazi accelerationist group,Ã‚Â Atomwaffen Division.

Subsequent groups followed and a series of deadly attacks by perpetrators who embraced accelerationist ideology shined a spotlight on this growing movement.

Ideology

White supremacist accelerationism is built on a series of tenets that set it apart from other white supremacist belief systems. Modern white supremacy takes various forms, though all variations hold one or more of the following beliefs:

1) White people should have dominance over people of other backgrounds, especially where they may co-exist

2) White people should live by themselves in a whites-only society

3) White people have their own ""culture"" that is superior to other cultures

4) White people are genetically superior to other people

Many white supremacists further believe that the white race is in danger of extinction at the hands of Ã¢Â€Âœnon-whitesÃ¢Â€Â (who, according to white supremacist beliefs, are being controlled and manipulated by Jews).

Accelerationist white supremacists hold these views, but also claim that modern society is inherently fragile, unstable, and heading towards an inevitable collapse. They advocate to Ã¢Â€Âœspeed upÃ¢Â€Â this collapse through violence, acts of sabotage and sowing general chaos, and believe that they will then have a real opportunity to reshape society to their own liking and beliefs. Accelerationist white supremacists may thus be more likely than other types of white supremacists to make explicit calls for direct, violent actions.

The targets of the attacks advocated for by white supremacist accelerationists vary, but can ultimately be split into two categories. The first consists of attacks against perceived enemies, including Jews (evidenced by theÃ‚Â 2019 Poway Synagogue shooting), people of color (seen in theÃ‚Â 2022 Tops Friendly Market shooting in Buffalo), immigrants (demonstrated in theÃ‚Â 2019 El Paso shooting) LGBTQ+ people (targeted in theÃ‚Â 2022 Bratislava shootingÃ‚Â and 2023 Colorado Springs shooting) and Muslims (shown by theÃ‚Â 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings).

The second consists of targets that could theoretically destabilize society when attacked, such as critical infrastructure connected to the power grid.

White supremacist accelerationist propaganda frequently encourages both types of attacks and provides detailed guides on the vulnerabilities of different types of infrastructure and how to exploit them. These materials also often insist that potential perpetrators are more likely to get away with such crimes than they think.

Although there have been some arrests for plots to attack the power gridÃ¢Â€Â”including the co-founder of Atomwaffen Division, who allegedly planned to attack an energy facility in Baltimore, MD in February 2023 Ã¢Â€Â” actual attacks by accelerationist white supremacists have overwhelmingly targeted humans.

White supremacist accelerationist propaganda also includes messaging that is openly hostile towards other white supremacist groups, labeling them as Ã¢Â€Âœmovementarians,Ã¢Â€Â and criticizing them for their perceived lack of action and inability to effect change. There is also criticism from white supremacist accelerationists that other white supremacists are too concerned about theÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœopticsÃ¢Â€Â of their movement, with accelerationists insisting that matters of public image and opinion are not as important as taking direct action.

White supremacist accelerationists also sometimes view joining large, organized groups as risky, insisting that followers opt for autonomous direct action instead.

Ã‚Â 

Accelerationist groups

The first neo-Nazi accelerationist groupÃ‚Â Atomwaffen Division, founded in 2015 byÃ‚Â Brandon Russell and Devon Arthurs, sought to spread MasonÃ¢Â€Â™s ideas and promote the acceleration of societal collapse through violence, while simultaneously preparing its members for an impending race war.

AtomwaffenÃ¢Â€Â™s main actions included organizing Ã¢Â€Âœhate campÃ¢Â€Â hiking excursions and paramilitary-style activities to prepare members for societal destabilization and eventual collapse and indoctrinate new members. The group also organized propaganda distributions and attended rallies and events organized by other white supremacist groups.

Outside of these regular group activities, Atomwaffen quickly gained notoriety following the high-profile arrests of multiple group members. In May 2017 in Tampa, Florida, Arthurs murdered two of his and RussellÃ¢Â€Â™s roommates, Atomwaffen Division members Jeremy Himmelman and Andrew Oneschuk, while Russell was away for National Guard duty. Arthurs claimed to have committed the murders because his roommates ridiculed his recent conversion to Islam. He also alleged after his arrest that his roommates were planning terror attacks, possibly against nuclear plants. However, Arthurs suffered from significant mental health issues and was deemed incompetent to stand trial. After more than a year in a mental health facility, Arthurs was determined to be competent to stand trial, leading him to eventually plead guilty in 2023 to reduced charges of second-degree murder; he received a 45-year prison sentence.

During the initial murder investigation, authorities discovered multiple explosive components in RussellÃ¢Â€Â™s possession, which led to the Atomwaffen leader pleading guilty to possessing explosives and receiving a five-year sentence in 2018.

In January 2018, California-based Atomwaffen Division member Samuel Woodward connected with a former high school classmate, Blaze Bernstein, on an online dating app. Woodward arranged a meeting with Bernstein, stabbed him to death and buried his body in a local park. Woodward was convicted of murder motivated by hate toward BernsteinÃ¢Â€Â™s gay and Jewish identity and sentenced to life in prison in November 2024.

These arrests, as well as the 2017 arrest of a Virginia teen and Mason admirer who purportedly committed a double murder (but killed himself in 2024 before trial), drew considerable attention to Atomwaffen Division from law enforcement.

The Florida incident also created a leadership vacuum in the absence of Atomwaffen DivisionÃ¢Â€Â™s two founders, Russell and Arthurs. John Cameron Denton assumed leadership of the group, but after police arrested him and four other members on harassment charges in February 2020, Atomwaffen officially disbanded. In July 2020, a small group of former members of Atomwaffen reorganized as theÃ‚Â National Socialist Order (NSO), and another splinter group would later form, called theÃ‚Â National Socialist Resistance Front, following ideological disputes between members.

In November 2024, the staff atÃ‚Â The American Futurist, an accelerationist publication affiliated with former Atomwaffen members, announced that the National Socialist Resistance Front had officially disbanded.

Before it fell apart, Atomwaffen had already served as the blueprint for many other neo-Nazi accelerationist groups inspired by its ideology and propaganda. Most of these groups were small, and many were short-lived, but they have spread white supremacist accelerationism into new corners.

In 2018,Ã‚Â Sonnenkrieg Division emerged as a European counterpart to Atomwaffen, with its founder describing Sonnenkrieg Division as Ã¢Â€ÂœAtomwaffen with less guns.Ã¢Â€Â Like Atomwaffen, Sonnenkrieg advocated for the use of violence to destabilize Ã¢Â€Âœthe systemÃ¢Â€Â and bring about an eventual societal collapse. SonnenkriegÃ¢Â€Â™s propaganda used many of the same Iron March-inspired aesthetic elements as propaganda produced by Atomwaffen. Despite SonnenkriegÃ¢Â€Â™s relatively small membership, it was eventually listed as a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom in February 2020 and subsequently, activity from the group largely ceased.

Ã‚Â 

Another Atomwaffen imitator wasÃ‚Â Feuerkrieg Division, an international white supremacist accelerationist group seemingly founded in 2018 by a 13-year-old boy from Estonia that ostensibly disbanded in 2020 but saw a resurgence on the encrypted social media appÃ‚Â Telegram the following year. Like Atomwaffen Division, Feuerkrieg DivisionÃ¢Â€Â™s beliefs were largely guided by MasonÃ¢Â€Â™s writings, and the group was allegedly linked to multiple terror plots and arrests, including the February 2020 arrest of Feuerkrieg memberÃ‚Â Conor Climo, who pleaded guilty to firearms charges following an investigation into an alleged plan to attack a synagogue and an LGBTQ+ bar in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Another ideological heir of Atomwaffen isÃ‚Â The Base, formed in 2018 byÃ‚Â Rinaldo Nazzaro, an American national from New Jersey currently living in Russia. Though small in numbers, The Base branded itself as a paramilitary or survivalist organization and Nazzaro claimed that its purpose was to unite white nationalists to prepare for violent insurgency.

Like Atomwaffen Division, The Base attracted notoriety and public scrutiny following separate infiltrations by a journalist, an activist and a law enforcement officer, and after the arrests of multiple members. In October 2021, three members of The Base in Maryland and Delaware were convicted on various firearm charges that the court determined were intended to promote federal terrorism crimes. A month later, three other members in Georgia were sentenced for their roles in an assassination plot against a couple they believed to be antifascists.

In the early 2020s, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union all designated The Base as a terrorist group. In February 2022, Nazzaro announced that he relinquished his leadership role in The Base, and the group saw little activity in the years that followed. However, in early 2024, individuals associated with The Base began distributing propaganda again in the United States, and by the end of the year, the group appeared to have a resurgence in activity, with social media profiles associated with the group sharing pictures of propaganda distributions and videos depicting training sessions with members.

Also noteworthy in the white supremacist accelerationist landscape isÃ‚Â Injekt Division, a small accelerationist group active in spreading propaganda online and through the distribution of stickers and fliers. Injekt Division gained media attention after alleged founder Coleman BlevinsÃ‚Â was arrested in May 2021 for reportedly making threats to conduct a mass shooting at a Walmart in Kerrville, Texas. In May 2024, a jury convicted him on related firearms charges, leading to a five-year sentence.

Activity from the group dwindled following BlevinsÃ¢Â€Â™ arrest, but the group reemerged online in April 2023. In 2024, offline activity from the group was largely confined to Pennsylvania.

The Tarrant Effect and a Rise in Notoriety

A seminal event for the accelerationist movement was the 2019 deadly mass shooting in New Zealand by a lone-wolf killer. The live-streamed attack provided a boost in visibility and popularity for accelerationism and came to serve as a blueprint for similarly motivated killings.

In March 2019, Australian white supremacistÃ‚Â Brenton Tarrant launched shooting attacks inside two separate mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, where congregants were gathered, killing 51 people and injuring 89.

Tarrant likely deliberately structured his attacks to inspire other violent accelerationists to follow in his footsteps. Before the mass killings, Tarrant released an online manifesto titled Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Great Replacement,Ã¢Â€Â a direct reference to the white supremacistÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœGreat ReplacementÃ¢Â€Â conspiracy theory. Though not the first person to release a manifesto before a largescale act of violence, TarrantÃ¢Â€Â™s document stood out because it not only contained hateful justifications for the attack, but also a series of memes, in-jokes and Ã¢Â€ÂœshitpostsÃ¢Â€Â born out of far-right online spaces like 4chan and 8chan.

Many other white supremacist shooters later emulated this style of manifesto, includingÃ‚Â Ryan Palmeter, who killed three people at a Dollar General store in Jacksonville, Florida, on August 26, 2023, before taking his own life. Palmeter stated in his own manifesto that Tarrant served as the primary inspiration for his attack.

Seemingly trying to simulate first-person shooter video games, Tarrant also attached a camera to his helmet and live-streamed his attack on Facebook, giving viewers a first-person perspective of the massacre.Ã‚Â Payton Gendron, who carried out a deadly shooting at the Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo, NY in May 2022, later emulated this tactic, as didÃ‚Â Arda KÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ¼kyetim, who, according to authorities, carried out a mass stabbing attack at a mosque in EskiÃ…ÂŸehir, Turkey in August 2024.

Anderson Lee Aldrich, who opened fire at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in November 2022, killing five, tried but failed to livestream his attack;Ã‚Â Stephan Balliet, who tried to attack a synagogue in Halle, Germany, in October 2019, livestreamed his attempts to get into the establishment to launch his attack. He failed to get inside but later shot and killed two people nearby.

Terrorgram

Since its emergence, many online communities have promoted white supremacist accelerationism, but few were more influential than theÃ‚Â Terrorgram Collective, a decentralized collection of white supremacist accelerationist groups and individuals active on Telegram.

Terrorgram first took shape in 2019-2020, in the wake of the attacks by Tarrant and others. These attacks inspired accelerationists to create propaganda specifically to encourage more white supremacist accelerationist terror attacks. These propagandists became known as the Terrorgram Collective, an inner circle within the Terrorgram network that focuses on the creation and circulation of Terrorgram-branded materials. These materials, typically circulated in the form of digital publications and short-form propaganda videos, seek to inspire violence against Jews, people of color, Muslims, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community and other groups or individuals perceived as enemies.

The materials created and promoted by Terrorgram differ from typical white supremacist propaganda in two main ways. While most white supremacist propaganda seeks to generally demonize perceived enemies, with few explicit calls to violence (often out of fear of law enforcement action or lawsuits), the Terrorgram Collective directly calls for its audience to take violent action, even providing implicit or explicit instruction on how to commit various acts of violence.

Ã‚Â 

Additionally, Terrorgram propaganda calls for not just violence against people, but destruction and sabotage of other physical targets, including transportation infrastructure such as railroads and bridges, communication infrastructure such as 5G towers, and electrical infrastructure such as transformers and distribution substations.

In September 2024, federal authorities arrested two leaders of the Terrorgram Collective, Matthew Allison of Boise, Idaho and Dallas Humber of Elk Grove, California, as part of a 15-count indictment for soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. In the charging documents, federal authorities alleged that the two directly inspired at least three terror attacks both in the U.S. and abroad.

In January 2025, the United States governmentÃ‚Â designated the Terrorgram Collective and three of its foreign-based leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists.

Key Incidents and Arrests

Since 2019, white supremacist accelerationists have been implicated in several attacks, attempted attacks, plots and other incidents leading to arrests. Nearly every instance below has resulted in the arrest of the perpetrator, and in some cases, arrests were made before the plot could be fully carried out.

The targets of these attacks have been both in and outside of the United States.

Nashville, Tennessee, November 4, 2024:Ã‚Â Federal authorities arrestedÃ‚Â Skyler Philippi after he unknowingly collaborated with two undercover agents while allegedly plotting to carry out an attack on an electrical substation near Nashville. According to the criminal complaint, Philippi planned on carrying out the attack in furtherance of his white supremacist accelerationist ideology. At the time of publication, Philippi is awaiting trial.
EskiÃ…ÂŸehir, Turkiye, August 12, 2024:Ã‚Â Turkish authorities arrestedÃ‚Â Arda KÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ¼kyetim after he allegedly carried out a stabbing attack at a mosque, injuring five people. Shortly before the attack, the perpetrator released a manifesto that appeared to be influenced by white supremacist accelerationism, and a folder containing PDFs of white supremacist accelerationist texts, including the Terrorgram Publications. At the time of publication, no further information is available regarding the status of his case.
East Brunswick, New Jersey, July 11, 2024: Federal authorities arrestedÃ‚Â Andrew Takhistov after he allegedly solicited an undercover agent to commit an attack against an electrical substation in New Jersey. The teen allegedly instructed the undercover agent on how to carry out the attack and sent them Terrorgram materials intended to help them in carrying out the operation. At the time of publication, Takhistov is awaiting trial.
Jacksonville, Florida, August 26, 2023:Ã‚Â According to the authorities,Ã‚Â Ryan Christopher Palmeter carried out a mass shooting in a Dollar General store, killing three individuals, all of whom were Black. Before carrying out the attack, Palmeter wrote a manifesto that appeared to be inspired by accelerationist themes and contained many similarities to the manifesto released by Brenton Tarrant before his attack. Palmeter took his own life shortly after the attack.
Baltimore, Maryland, February 3, 2023:Ã‚Â Federal authorities arrested former Atomwaffen Division leaderÃ‚Â Brandon Russell and Sarah Beth Clendaniel for allegedly plotting to destroy an energy facility outside of Baltimore, Maryland. Clendaniel pleaded guilty in May 2024 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison in September 2024, while RussellÃ¢Â€Â™s trial began in early 2025.
Manchester, United Kingdom, January 27, 2023:Ã‚Â British authorities sentencedÃ‚Â Daniel Harris to 11.5 years in prison for the creation and dissemination of videos that purportedly inspired Payton Gendron and Anderson Lee Aldrich, who carried out deadly 2022 attacks in Buffalo, New York and Colorado Springs, Colorado, respectively.
Colorado Springs, Colorado, November 19, 2022:Ã‚Â Anderson Lee Aldrich opened fire inside of LGBTQ+ bar Club Q, killing five and injuring 19. According to testimony by local law enforcement, Aldrich administered a website that hosted footage live-streamed by Brenton Tarrant during the Christchurch, New Zealand massacre. Aldrich was found guilty and sentenced to 190 years in prison.
Bratislava, Slovakia, October 12, 2022:Ã‚Â Juraj Krajcik opened fire outside of a gay bar and killed two people, one man and one non-binary person. In a manifesto released before the attack, he thanked the Terrorgram Collective and recommended two of their publications to readers of his manifesto. Krajcik took his own life within hours of the attack.
Buffalo, New York, May 14, 2022:Ã‚Â Payton Gendron entered a Tops supermarket and opened fire, shooting 13 people, ten fatally. In his manifesto, he claimed to be inspired by Brenton Tarrant, with entire sections of his manifestoÃ‚Â directly plagiarized from TarrantÃ¢Â€Â™s. Gendron pleaded guilty to state terrorism and murder charges in November 2022 and was sentencedÃ‚Â to life in prison without parole in February 2023.
Raleigh, NC, August 21, 2021: Federal authorities chargedÃ‚Â Paul James Kryscuk, Liam Collins, Jordan Duncan and Joseph Maurion, and later Justin Wade Hemanson, with conspiracy to damage an energy facility. Indictments alleged that the individuals were members of the Iron March forum, and all five received a combined 324 months in prison in 2024.
Bad Axe, Michigan, October 29, 2020:Ã‚Â Authorities arrestedÃ‚Â Justen Watkins and Alfred Gorman, both members of The Base, on multiple charges, and accused them of harassment after they took pictures outside a familyÃ¢Â€Â™s home thinking that an antifascist podcaster lived there. In August 2021, more charges were filed against Watkins and two other members, Thomas Denton and Tristan Webb, for entering abandoned Michigan Department of Corrections sites to assess their usefulness for training. Watkins was sentenced to up to six years in 2022, Gorman was sentenced to four years of parole in 2022, Denton was sentenced to 48 months in 2022, and Webb was sentenced to five years of probation in 2022.
Louisville, Kentucky, June 10, 2020:Ã‚Â Federal authorities arrested U.S. Army memberÃ‚Â Ethan Melzer for plotting an attack on the soldiers in his unit. Charging documents alleged that Melzer provided sensitive information regarding his unitÃ¢Â€Â™s anticipated deployment to Ã¢Â€ÂœRapeWaffen Division,Ã¢Â€Â which claims to be a splinter group of Atomwaffen Division. Melzer pled guilty in June 2022 and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison.
Greenbelt, Maryland, January 16, 2020:Ã‚Â Federal authorities arrested three members of The Base, Brian Mark Lemley Jr., William Garfield Bilbrough IV and Canadian national Patrik Jordan Mathews with charges relating to transporting firearms and harboring aliens. According to law enforcement, the three men were planning on attending an upcoming pro-gun rally in Virginia the following week. All three men pleaded guilty to related charges and received prison sentences,Ã‚Â Lemley and Mathews received nine-year sentences whileÃ‚Â Bilbrough received five.
Halle, Germany, October 9, 2019: Stephan Balliet livestreamed himself attempting to enter a synagogue armed with improvised firearms and explosives. After his attempts were unsuccessful, he shot and killed two people near a kebab shop before being arrested. According to Balliet, the attack was inspired by Brenton Tarrant and his attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 2020.
BÃƒÂ¦rum, Norway, August 10, 2019: Philip Manshaus opened fire outside of a mosque. Fortunately, no one was injured. According to law enforcement, evidence suggested that Manshaus was inspired by Tarrant and his massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand earlier in the year. Manshaus was sentenced to 21 years in prison in 2020.
Las Vegas, Nevada, August 9, 2019:Ã‚Â Federal authorities arrestedÃ‚Â Conor Climo, who discussed plans to set fire to a Las Vegas synagogue, and he laterÃ‚Â pleaded guilty to one count of possession of an unregistered firearm and wasÃ‚Â sentenced to two years in prison. According to court documents, Climo had ties to Feuerkrieg Division.
El Paso, Texas, August 3, 2019:Ã‚Â Patrick Crusius killed 23 people at a Walmart in a predominantly Hispanic area. In his manifesto, he cited Brenton TarrantÃ¢Â€Â™s attack in Christchurch as a source of inspiration. In 2023, Crusius was sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in prison.
London, United Kingdom, June 18, 2019:Ã‚Â Authorities sentenced Michael Szewczuk and Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, both members of Sonnenkrieg Division, for encouraging terrorist attacks. Dunn-Koczorowski was sentenced to 18 months, while Szewczuk was sentenced to just over four years.
Poway, California, April 27, 2019: John Earnest opened fire at the Chabad of Poway, killing one and injuring three others, shortly after a separate arson incident against a local mosque in late March 2019. In his own manifesto, Earnest referenced Tarrant and his attack multiple times and referred to Tarrant as the Ã¢Â€ÂœcatalystÃ¢Â€Â for his actions. In 2021, EarnestÃ‚Â pleaded guilty to a 113-count federal hate crimeÃ‚Â indictment and wasÃ‚Â sentenced to life plus 30 years.
Christchurch, New Zealand, March 15, 2019: Brenton Tarrant drove to two separate mosques, and livestreamed himself carrying out a mass shooting that resulted in 51 deaths. In a manifesto released shortly before the attack, Brenton Tarrant had a section titled Ã¢Â€ÂœDestabilization and Accelerationism: Tactics for VictoryÃ¢Â€Â in which he writes that white supremacists Ã¢Â€Âœmust destabilize and discomfort society where ever [sic] possible.Ã¢Â€Â Tarrant pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving life in prison without parole.","[2, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.1, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-brandeis-center-settle-title-vi-complaint-after-occidental-college,"New York, NY, November 26, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ Occidental College has agreed to take a series of steps to address and prevent antisemitism on campus as part of a sweeping settlement agreement reached in response to a federal Title VI complaint filed by ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law.

Under the terms of the settlement announced today, the Los Angeles-based private liberal arts college has agreed to undertake a series of initiatives to repair the campus climate, including adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance AllianceÃ¢Â€Â™s (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism when reviewing complaints of antisemitic harassment and discrimination, and holding campus-wide Title VI trainings for both faculty and students, which will include specific sessions on antisemitic harassment.

The agreement resolves the allegations raised by the ADL and the Brandeis CenterÃ‚Â in aÃ‚Â complaint filed by the organizations in April 2024 with the U.S. Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The complaint charged that Jewish students enrolled at Occidental encountered a Ã¢Â€Âœpervasive and hostile environmentÃ¢Â€Â that included severe antisemitic bullying, intimidation and physical threats in the weeks and months following the Hamas massacre in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis agreement demonstrates Occidental CollegeÃ¢Â€Â™s commitment to counter all forms of contemporary antisemitism and underscores their recognition that effectively combatting antisemitism requires understanding the relationship between Jewish identity, Israel, and Zionism,Ã¢Â€Â said Alyza D. Lewin, President of the Brandeis Center. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are gratified by the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s engagement in meaningful discussions at the highest levels of the administration, and we are heartened that Occidental has committed to creating a safer environment for Jewish students. When implemented, this agreement will help ensure that Jewish students are able to learn and thrive in an environment free from anti-Semitic hate, discrimination, and harassment.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are pleased that Occidental College has committed to meaningful steps to ensure that the civil rights of Jewish students on campus are protected and affirm that antisemitism has no place on campus,Ã¢Â€Â added Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. Ã¢Â€ÂœThis outcome demonstrates how the Title VI OCR process can work to effectively protect Jewish students. We are deeply grateful for the U.S. Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s dedication and assistance in resolving this case. It is our hope that this resolution will lead to other college administrators implementing these or similar measures proactively to address antisemitism on campus.Ã¢Â€Â

The parties negotiated the agreement with the support of an OCR mediator.

According to the resolution agreement signed by all parties, Occidental agreed to take the following actions to mitigate antisemitism on campus going into the 2025-26 academic year:

Update the CollegeÃ¢Â€Â™s Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Policy (Ã¢Â€ÂœDHR PolicyÃ¢Â€Â), including examples of prohibited conduct that could constitute disparate treatment or harassment based on shared ancestry, such as Jewish identity.
Consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition and examples of antisemitism (Ã¢Â€ÂœIHRA definitionÃ¢Â€Â) when reviewing complaints of potential antisemitic harassment or discrimination.
Incorporate the IHRA definition into educational materials that will be made available on OccidentalÃ¢Â€Â™s website.
Require training for all students on Title VI and the collegeÃ¢Â€Â™s discrimination, harassment and retaliation policy, including the collegeÃ¢Â€Â™s complaint process.
Update the collegeÃ¢Â€Â™s time, place and manner policies to place reasonable limitations on the hours and conduct of demonstrations on campus.
Assess the campus environment using two planned climate surveys during the 2024-25 academic year to assess whether individuals have experienced antisemitic harassment or discrimination. The survey results will be shared with the Occidental community and made public on the collegeÃ¢Â€Â™s website.
Provide expert-facilitated training for the collegeÃ¢Â€Â™s Civil Rights & Title IX Office staff and members of the Bias Education and Support Team regarding (i) Jewish identity (including common issues of faith, history, and heritage) and (ii) forms of antisemitism, including how it can be used to discriminate against Jewish and Israeli students.
Include the following examples in the above listed training: Ã¢Â€Âœposting a threatening statement about Zionists on a Jewish or Israeli studentÃ¢Â€Â™s doorÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœapplying a Ã¢Â€Â˜no ZionistÃ¢Â€Â™ litmus test for participation in any Occidental activity.Ã¢Â€Â
Appoint an Associate Director of Jewish Student Life.
Form a Presidential Advisory Group, which will produce a report to the President during the 2024-2025 academic year, including recommendations for specific, high-impact programs to build a foundation for inter-group dialogue.Ã‚Â 
Continue to offer lectures and workshops related to the historical antecedents and modern manifestations of antisemitism and the connections between Jewish identity, Israel and Zionism.

The original complaint detailed how Jewish students were forced out of school-sponsored employment opportunities due to severe and pervasive antisemitic environments. Jewish students were harassed and obstructed daily on campus, in their dorms, in the dining hall, and elsewhere.

Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination against Jews on the basis of their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding. Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

Anti-bias education is a comprehensive approach to teaching and learning designed to increase the understanding of identity and differences and their value to an inclusive and just society and to actively challenge bias, discrimination in schools, communities and society. Anti-bias education incorporates inclusive curriculum content that reflects diverse experiences and perspectives, instructional methods that advance all studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ learning, and strategies to establish and sustain safe, inclusive, respectful and equitable learning communities.

ADL Education's Approach to Anti-Bias Education

ADL EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s anti-bias education pillars reflect our philosophy for how students (and others) recognize and build understanding of bias in themselves, others, and society and learn ways to address and challenge it.

The Anti-Defamation LeagueÃ¢Â€Â™s (ADL) Task Force on Middle East Minorities condemns the tragic murder of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the United Arab Emirates.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/millions-examples-extremist-and-antisemitic-content-found-steam-new,"New York, NY, November 14, 2024, Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã‚Â  More than 1.8 million unique pieces of extremist or hateful content, including explicitly antisemitic, neo-Nazi and Islamist terrorist material, were identified on Steam, the worldÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â largest and most popular online gaming marketplace, new research from ADL (Anti-Defamation League) finds.

In an unprecedented platform-wide capture of all publicly available profiles, groups and comments (as of July 2024), the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) also identified 1.5 million unique users and over 73,000 groups who used at least one piece of potentially extremist or hateful content. The comprehensive dataset includes more than 458 million profiles, 152 million profile and group avatar images and 610 million comments on user profiles and groups.

Millions of these hateful or extremist examples were found on Steam Community, SteamÃ¢Â€Â™s social networking space where users can connect and share content. Hateful and extremist content includedÃ‚Â tens of thousands of pieces of terrorism-related content;Ã‚Â more than 15,000 accounts had profile pictures containing the logos and flags of foreign terrorist organizations like ISIS, Hezbollah, Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas, as well as the names of known terrorists. COE also identifiedÃ‚Â antisemitic symbols like the Ã¢Â€Âœhappy merchantÃ¢Â€Â and Nazi imagery like theÃ‚Â Totenkopf,Ã‚Â swastika,Ã‚Â sonnenrad and others. Posts with these symbols remained on the platform despite previous concerns raised byÃ‚Â governmentÃ‚Â bodies andÃ‚Â policymakers.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe wide breadth and sheer volumeÃ‚Â of hateful and antisemitic content on Steam is mind-boggling,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœADL researchers found millions of examples on the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest online gaming distribution service glorifying everything from Nazi symbols to Islamist terrorists. This means millions of young and vulnerable people are regularly exposed to dangerous individuals and rhetoric, with a very real risk of inflicting harm both online and offline. SteamÃ¢Â€Â™s parent company, Valve, needs to make significant changes in terms of policy and practice to address this shocking proliferation of hate.Ã¢Â€Â


Additional findings include:

Copypastas (blocks of text that are copied and pasted to form images or long-form writing) are a popular method for sharing extremist or hateful content on Steam.Ã‚Â COE detected 1.18 million unique instances of extremist and hateful copypastas, 54 percent (634,749) of which were white supremacist and 5 percent (55,109) were antisemitic. The most popular copypastas were, by far, variations of swastikas, at 51 percent.
A significant number of Steam users and group pages use an avatar (profile picture) with potentially extremist or hateful symbols. Multiple users can have the same avatar image. COE identified 827,758 profiles with avatars that contained extremist or hateful symbols.
COE also identified 184,622 instances of hateful or extremist keywords on Steam. Additionally, 18,352 groups used extremist or hateful keywords on their group profiles. The most used keywords in an extremist or hateful context on Steam Community are Ã¢Â€Âœ1488,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœshekelÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœwhite power.Ã¢Â€Â
COE analysts identified thousands of profiles that glorify violent extremists, like white supremacist mass shooters. These include avatar pictures featuring mass shooters, references to manifestos and stills from livestreamed attacks, like theÃ‚Â 2019 Christchurch, New Zealand shooting. In some cases Ã¢Â€Â“ like the 18-year-old whoÃ‚Â attacked a cafÃƒÂ© in Turkey in Aug. 2024 Ã¢Â€Â“ users posting this content on Steam have subsequently committed acts of offline violence.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe believe this is the most comprehensive snapshot of hate and extremism present on Steam to date,Ã¢Â€Â said Oren Segal, VP of the ADL Center on Extremism. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe clear gaps in SteamÃ¢Â€Â™s moderation policies not only normalize hate and extremism in the gaming community, but also introduce users to the ideologies and movements that animate real world violence.""

Earlier this year, the annualÃ‚Â ADL Hate and Harassment in Online Gaming survey found that harassment of young gamers increased across the board, with three-quarters of teens and pre-teens saying they experienced harassment while playing online multiplayer games, up from 67 percent in 2022. Identity-based harassment of young people ages 10-17 increased to 37 percent in 2023, up from 29 percent in 2022. Nine percent of teens were exposed to white supremacist ideologies in online games, and of those, 30 percent were exposed on a weekly or greater basis.

The report includes detailed recommendations for Valve and for policy makers:

For Valve:

Adopt Policies Prohibiting Extremism. Currently there is no policy on Steam that prohibits the presence of known extremists, extremist recruitment, the celebration of extremist groups and movements or even the expression of the hateful ideologies that animate extremists. While the game industry is, in general, behind the social media industry in addressing the abuse of their products by extremist actors, we have seen some progress in the last year. ADL reviewed the recent progress and wrote about three current models for game companies to potentially implement anti-extremism policies.
Adopt Policies Prohibiting Hate.
Enforce Policies Accurately at Scale.
Audit and Red Team Content Moderation Practices to Close Loopholes.
Engage with Civil Society, Academics and Researchers.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

For Policy Makers:

As ADL has saidÃ‚Â previously, policymakers must demonstrate their commitment to disrupting hate and harassment in online multiplayer games. ADL recommends stakeholder groups take the following steps to play an active role in promoting online safety and mitigating the risk of these dangers and their impact on users:

Prioritize transparency legislation in digital spaces and include online multiplayer games.
Enhance access to justice for victims of online abuseÃ‚Â as existing laws have not kept up with increasing and worsening forms of digital abuse. Policymakers must introduce and pass legislation that holds perpetrators of severe online abuse accountable for their offenses at both the state and federal levels. ADLÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â Backspace Hate initiative works to bridge these legal gaps and has had numerous successes, especially at the state level.
Establish a National Gaming Safety Task Force.
Support research efforts with additional resources.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Methodology

To understand the scope of extremist content on Steam on a platform-wide scale, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s quantitative analysis examined three types of media: extremist symbols (in profile and group avatars), copypasta (in multi-line text fields) and keywords (in short and long text fields). Concurrently, COE analysts conducted in-depth qualitative investigative research into users and groups of interest.

The data collection for this report aimed to capture everything publicly available on the platform as of July 2024, reaching back to the earliest data ADL researchers could retrieve for each section of research. Any content that was deleted or removed before the data collection window is not included in the study.

The hate symbol image detection research in this study was conducted using HateVision, a proprietary AI tool developed by the ADL Center on Extremism. Leveraging cutting-edge computer vision technology, HateVision is trained on a comprehensive dataset of 39 key potentially extremist and antisemitic symbols. This powerful tool rapidly scans and identifies hateful content on images and videos, enabling researchers to analyze vast amounts of multimodal data and detect hate, extremism and antisemitism with high precision. A full methodology section is included here.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

New York, NY, November 8, 2024 ... ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today expressed its deep horror and outrage at the violent, widespread, and apparently premeditated and coordinated antisemitic attack on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam, following a game between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax last night.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Scores of Israelis were hunted down, brutally assaulted and injured. The attackersÃ¢Â€Â™ own videos showed Israelis fearfully scrambling to find safety amidst the violent mob, including some who hid for hours, or reportedly jumped into canals to save themselves. Although this incident followed a soccer match in Europe, it could easily have occurred at any event or on any street worldwide, given the depth and urgency of the global tsunami of antisemitism targeting Jews, Israelis, and Zionists. This includes the support and celebration of terrorism by groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, which are justified and tolerated in various regions, including the U.S. and beyond.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

ADL CEO and National Director, Jonathan Greenblatt, said:Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is what Ã¢Â€Â˜globalize the intifadaÃ¢Â€Â™ looks like. It is particularly haunting that on the eve of Kristallnacht (the November 1938 pogrom in Germany), Jews on the streets of Amsterdam were hunted, chased, attacked and forced to hide from an antisemitic mob whose goal was to harm as many Jews as possible.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

We welcome the strong condemnations from Dutch leaders, including the poignant statement by King Willem-Alexander, who said Ã¢Â€Âœlast night we failed the Jews again.Ã¢Â€Â However, more must be done by authorities in Amsterdam, and indeed around the world to protect Jews from this violent hatred.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

We call on authorities to take immediate action:

Dutch authorities must openly examine:

The preparation of law enforcement Ã¢Â€Â“ before, during and after the match, how the mobilization of anti-Israel groups who conducted this assault was not disrupted, and account for how this attack persisted for hours, with Israelis running and hiding in fear for their lives, without adequate protection from police.
Ã‚Â 

Given the extent of the rampage and violence, the number of detentions to date is alarming low.Ã‚Â  Authorities must take decisive and immediate action to identify and detain all those responsible, and to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law, sending a clear message that hate and violence will not be tolerated and that perpetrators will be held fully accountable.Ã‚Â 

European authorities must conduct an intensive investigation into who organized this attack, through what social media and other channels and with what support, including the possibility of non-Dutch instigators.

Sports officials around the globe, in soccer and other sports, must respond to this horrifying assault by committing to proudly playing with Israeli teams Ã¢Â€Â“ in Israel and around the world.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The answer to this hate and violence cannot be the sidelining and canceling of Israeli teams and athletes which sadly has been already happening since October 7.Ã‚Â 

Sports federations, along with law enforcement agencies, must develop strong protocols for protections for fans inside and outside of stadiums and for responding to violence of any kind with a focus on antisemitism.Ã‚Â 

Governments and civil society must make clear that there is no justification, no tolerance, no excuse for antisemitism, period.Ã‚Â  Too many are looking the other way at clear-cut support for violence and hate, without concern of the real-life consequences.Ã‚Â 

EditorÃ¢Â€Â™s Note: There are conflicting reports from authorities in Amsterdam as to the exact number of Israelis who were chased. Law enforcement say the number may have been in the hundreds, and not thousands, as initially reported. This statement has been updated to Ã¢Â€ÂœscoresÃ¢Â€Â to reflect the latest information available.

Ã‚Â 

New York, NY, October 30, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today commended the House Committee on Education and the Workforce for its investigation into the antisemitism that has taken colleges and universities by storm since the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7, 2023. The committeeÃ¢Â€Â™s investigation found that the leadership of several institutions failed to confront rampant antisemitism on their campuses and prioritize the safety of Jewish students.

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO, issued the following statement:

We applaud Congress for continuing to exercise its oversight authority to investigate the antisemitism Jewish students are facing across the country and hold colleges and universities accountable. Ã‚Â 

No student should face hatred at school, but since Oct. 7, the antisemitic vitriol, intimidation and violence in classrooms and on campuses has been unrelenting.Ã‚Â 

In the year following HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ October 7th attack against Israel,Ã¢Â€Â¯ADL has recorded over 1,200 antisemitic incidents on college and university campuses in the United States. In the same period a year before, ADL recorded about 200 incidents, representing a 500-percent increase.Ã‚Â 

TodayÃ¢Â€Â™s report from Congress shines a light on many of the issues ADL has been sounding an alarm on for the past year. Administrators have the responsibility to protect their students Ã¢Â€Â“ yet they too often fail to enforce their own policies and codes of conduct, frequently allowing offenders to face little to no accountability by compromising on disciplinary actions for those who violate policies.Ã‚Â 

Due to the rising crisis of antisemitism in educational spaces, Ã‚Â ADL launched the new Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) today. CCAE will prioritize a whole-of-society approach to countering antisemitism in education Ã¢Â€Â“ harnessing ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s research, advocacy, litigation, monitoring and outreach to drive meaningful action to change the education ecosystem and protect students.Ã‚Â 

Congress and the Administration must take swift action to protect students on campus.Ã‚Â  Congress should urgently pass the Countering Antisemitism Act and the Antisemitism Awareness Act which would give government the tools to more effectively combat the campus antisemitism crisis this report documents. In order to ensure the Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s Office for Civil Rights can protect studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ rights, safety, and welcoming, Congress must ensure that it hasÃ‚Â sufficient resources.Ã‚Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœOnce again, extremists and conspiracy theorists are leveraging social media platforms to spread false election narratives targeting marginalized groups, in particular Jews and immigrants,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. Ã¢Â€ÂœThese narratives that include claims that Jews or Israel secretly control U.S. elections are not only false and grotesque but also dangerous. We call on social media platforms to act now to protect all communities and to ensure that hateful election misinformation is never tolerated.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL found that these four platforms continue to make exceptions for some kinds of misinformation, such as false allegations of past voter fraud, and that their policies are generally insufficient to prevent coordinated disinformation campaigns, such as users knowingly spreading fringe conspiracy theories. Moreover, no platform allows sufficient data access for independent researchers to study the extent of misinformation or rules enforcement. In fact, X and RedditÃ‚Â curtailed data access for researchers in 2023.Ã‚Â 

Additionally, many platforms rolled back policies against delegitimizing elections in two key areas: rules against claiming early victory and rules against false narratives about past elections. One positive change though was that all four platforms now appear to prohibit threats against election workers, including harassment and threatening violence (a policy that TikTok already had in place).Ã‚Â 

As of publication, no platform took action on the hateful election misinformation examples ADL reported. ADL also found that the user reporting options in some cases do not match a given platformÃ¢Â€Â™s policies. This was especially evident on TikTok and on X.Ã‚Â 

The report includes detailed recommendations for social media platforms:

Reinstate prior policies: Rolling back rules against false claims of past fraud or declaring early victory undermines efforts to curb hateful election misinformation. Rumors targeting immigrants and Jews undermine electoral integrity and democracy and put targeted groups at risk, fueling antisemitism and potentially political violence.
Enforce rules consistently and equitably: Policies are only as good as their enforcement. Platforms must scale the resources necessary to identify and remove prohibited election misinformation, including automated and human review. High profile accounts such as political officials or candidates should not be exempt; on the contrary, because of their influence, they should be held to higher standards.
Ensure user reporting matches policy: TikTok, X/Twitter, and others must make available to users the complete list of prohibited misinformation through the reporting interface (such as through a link to the full policy details).
Respond to user reports of election misinformation: ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s recent research shows that platforms increasingly do not act on regular user reports, relying instead either on their own proactive detection (often automated) or on reports from reputable organizations like ADL, as part of Ã¢Â€Âœtrusted flaggerÃ¢Â€Â programs. Users can play an important role in preventing the spread of hateful misinformation, especially narratives that require human interpretation to detect, such as those that depend on context or implicit information.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â 
Apply election rules year-round:Ã‚Â Election misinformation does not end after an election; on the contrary, hateful false narratives can grow and develop further, and lead to political violence as they did on January 6, 2021.
Data access for researchers: Restore (or establish) free or low-cost research APIs for independent researchers that allow for random samples of all content, not just libraries of curated content or top posts.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/pflp-charity-arm-samidoun-has-long-played-role-anti-israel-movement-us-campuses,"Anti-Zionist group Samidoun, sanctioned by the U.S. in October 2024 for its role as a Ã¢Â€Âœsham charityÃ¢Â€Â operating as an international fundraising arm of the U.S. government-designated terror organization the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), has long played a role in the anti-Israel movement on U.S. campuses. The group, which the U.S. considers to be a front for the PFLP in countries where it is declared a terrorist organization, has been featured as a Ã¢Â€Âœpro-PalestinianÃ¢Â€Â resource for years on some university websites such as City University of New York (CUNY) and California Institute of the Arts. Its representatives have also been invited for speaking engagements at campus events on several occasions.

Since the October 7 Hamas-led terror attack in Israel, in which the PFLP took part, Samidoun has co-sponsored several protests and events across the U.S. -- alongside groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) -- that have featured some of the most extreme pro-terror rhetoric and messaging in the anti-Israel space. These protests have also included instances of harassment and at least one on-campus event where activists engaged in the physical assault of Jews.

A March 2024 webinar at Columbia University featured Samidoun leader Khaled Barakat, who spoke of his ties to designated terror groups and lauded the October 7 attack. Barakat was personally sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury earlier this month for his role as a PFLP leadership member and fundraiser.

Protests and events

Perhaps the most egregious incident involving Samidoun on university campuses occurred on September 3, 2024, when a protest at Baruch College led to a reported assault of a Hillel staff member and harassment of Jewish students, who were reportedly called Ã¢Â€Âœbaby killersÃ¢Â€Â and told to go Ã¢Â€Âœback to Brooklyn.Ã¢Â€Â The protest was cosponsored by Samidoun, SJP Baruch, SJP affiliate PSA Hunter College, John Jay SJP, SJP CCNY, Baruch College Middle Eastern and North African Society and New York City Revolutionary Youth.

It was held to target Hillel, the largest Jewish student organization on campus, and call for CUNY to Ã¢Â€Âœcut tiesÃ¢Â€Â with the group. Just one day after the funeral of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli hostage who was executed by Hamas in late August alongside five other abductees, one of the protestors was filmed yelling at Jewish students, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhereÃ¢Â€Â™s Hersh, you ugly ass bitch?Ã¢Â€Â

Another disturbing incident involving Samidoun occurred at Columbia University in March 2024 when student activists hosted a webinar called Ã¢Â€ÂœResistance 101.Ã¢Â€Â The online event featured Barakat, his spouse Charlotte Kates who serves as SamidounÃ¢Â€Â™s Canada-based international coordinator and National SJP Steering Committee member Sean Eren. During the webinar, Barakat referred to Ã¢Â€Âœmy friends and brothers in Hamas, Islamic Jihad, you know, the PFLP in GazaÃ¢Â€Â and praised the Ã¢Â€ÂœAl Aqsa Flood operation,Ã¢Â€Â HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s name for the October 7, 2023 attack.

Another noteworthy incident on campus occurred on March 29, 2024, when a PFLP flag was displayed at a banner drop at the University of Washington cosponsored by Samidoun, Palestinian Youth Movement, Global Solidarity Network Seattle, Healthcare Workers for Palestine and Support the Palestinian Voice.

In other instances, speakers affiliated with Samidoun have been panelists at events on campus.Ã‚Â  For example, in November 2023, Kates was advertised as a panelist at an event titled Ã¢Â€ÂœTeach In: Contexts And Histories Of Palestinian ResistanceÃ¢Â€Â at City University of New York. A year prior, in November 2022, a page for an event hosted by New York UniversityÃ¢Â€Â™s law school stated that among the panelists was Ã¢Â€ÂœHussein from the NY/NJ chapter of Samidoun,Ã¢Â€Â who is referred to as one speaker among Ã¢Â€Âœother U.S.-based abolitionist organizers.Ã¢Â€Â

In November 2024, the radical anti-Zionist group New York Revolutionary Youth posted a photo from Sarah Lawrence College's fall encampment of a flag bearing the Samidoun logo and the image of convicted terrorist Georges Abdallah, formerly with the PFLP, who was sentenced to life in prison in France for the 1982 murders in Paris of an Israeli diplomat and an American military attachÃƒÂ©. The photo was reposted by far-left anti-Zionist network Unity of Fields, formerly Palestine Action U.S.

Ã‚Â 

SamidounÃ¢Â€Â™s platforming on university websites

Several U.S. university websites contain pages that promote Samidoun as a pro-Palestinian resource or advertise past events that have featured the fundraising arm of the PFLP. Of note, the California Institute of the Arts website contains a page from April 2024 titled Ã¢Â€ÂœResources for Palestinian LiberationÃ¢Â€Â that features Samidoun under Grassroots Media Outlets. Other examples include:

Fall 2024, City University of New York (CUNY): In the editorial introduction to the Fall 2024 issue of the CUNY Graduate CenterÃ¢Â€Â™s student-published, peer-reviewed journal, Theory, Research, and Action in Urban Education, the editors reference Ã¢Â€Âœthe critical work of organizations to free political prisoners such as Jericho and Samidoun.Ã¢Â€Â
May 2021, University of Illinois, Chicago: Ã¢Â€ÂœA Statement of Solidarity with Palestine from the UIC Global Asian Studies ProgramÃ¢Â€Â encourages readers to contact Samidoun to promote their events in support of a Palestinian strike.
December 2020: The Orfalea Center for Global & International Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara includes a link to SamidounÃ¢Â€Â™s website and Facebook page, in a list of Resources and Organizations on a page titled Structural Violence, Police/Prison Abolition, and Decoloniality.

Recommendations

University leadership nationwide must ensure that Samidoun, like all proxies for U.S.-designated terror organizations, has no place on campus. Allowing such groups to influence the campus environment Ã¢Â€Â“ including campus-based protests Ã¢Â€Â“ risks normalizing terrorism and threatens the safety of Jewish students and all members of the campus community. It is critical that policies designed to address the influence of such external actors are developed and strictly enforced. College campuses must not become places where extremist agendas and ideologies flourish.

Campus-based support for terrorist organizations is just one of the trends ADL is actively tracking in the campus anti-Israel movement. For more information on this, and on other trends, read our Six Trends blog.

There is a rising crisis of antisemitism in our educational spaces; the newÃ‚Â Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) will prioritize a whole-of-society approach to countering antisemitism in education Ã¢Â€Â“ harnessing ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s research, advocacy, litigation, monitoring and outreach to drive meaningful action to change the education ecosystem and protect students.

Ã¢Â€ÂœNo student should face hatred at school, but since Oct. 7 the antisemitic vitriol, intimidation and violence in classrooms and on campuses has been unrelenting,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœIn response to this, ADL is uniquely positioned to bring together a range of resources and stakeholders to target this critical issue for the Jewish community.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

The Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) will be led byÃ‚Â Shira Goodman, a leader with deep experience in education policy and advocacy. Goodman will collaborate with a team of ADL staff dedicated to campus and K-12 advocacy, curriculum development and stakeholder engagement.

Named in memory of the father of a longtime ADL supporter, CCAE will house all of ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s initiatives to combat antisemitism in K-12 schools and on college campuses. CCAE will pursue every available lever Ã¢Â€Â“ from collaboration and consultation to partnerships, lobbying and litigation -- to respond to antisemitism across the education ecosystem.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™re so proud of the work ADL does every day to counter antisemitism in schools and on campuses across the country,Ã¢Â€Â said Goodman. Ã¢Â€ÂœThis center will allow us to scale those efforts to serve even more students and their families by driving impact in more classrooms and on more campuses.Ã¢Â€Â

The initiative will also leverage ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s regional offices, ensuring local partnerships and national impact.

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s new center will rise to this challenge by prioritizing work in several key areas:

Enhancing Safety: Providing strategies to improve the emotional and physical well-being of Jewish students, faculty and staff, ensuring they are welcomed and included in their educational communities.
Holding Educational Institutions Accountable: Ensuring there are consequences for inaction and leveraging all available tools to ensure educational institutions meet the moment.
Countering All forms of Antisemitic Extremism: Actively disrupting antisemitic and anti-Israel groups and dismantling their harmful influence in K-12 and higher education spaces.
Empowering Jewish Communities and Allies: Equipping Jewish leaders and their allies with tools, resources and training to advocate effectively against antisemitism.

CCAE will stress accountability by producing the ADLÃ‚Â Campus Antisemitism Report Card, raising awareness, and ensuring officials exercise oversight to drive meaningful change; will offer legal support through ADLÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL); and will leverage tools like Title VI complaints to hold schools and universities accountable.

A recent ADLÃ‚Â report found that during the 2023-2024 school year, anti-Israel incidents on campuses in the United States increased 477 percent, including 360 instances of harassment, 201 instances of vandalism and 28 assaults. Additionally, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annualÃ‚Â Audit of Antisemitic Incidents found that antisemitic incidents in non-Jewish K-12 schools increased 135 percent from 2022 to 2023.Ã‚Â

Urges other institutions to follow suit as it reassesses Report Card grades

New York, NY, October 30, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today commended 10 colleges and universities for their recent efforts and policies to address campus antisemitism. Since the initial release of ADLÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â Campus Antisemitism Report Card in April of 2024, and a subsequent update in June following the protest encampments, these institutions have taken proactive steps to foster a more inclusive environment for Jewish students and all students.

Almost all assessed colleges and universities have revised their protest, demonstration and time, place and manner policies in advance of the new academic year. Additionally, at least over 50% of these schools have enacted other major changes, including establishing task forces, mandating antisemitism education and ameliorating bias incident reporting and investigation processes.

In letters to the presidents of each of the institutions, ADL praised the schools for their progress in working to combat antisemitism on campus. In alignment with ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Six Asks for combating antisemitism on college and university campuses, these 10 institutions have implemented a number of critical policies:

Alongside new procedures for campus demonstrations, the University of PennsylvaniaÃ‚Â has developed workshops on combating antisemitism and hate for members of the campus community and established the Office of Religious and Ethnic Inclusion.
University of Michigan has streamlined their system for responding to bias incidents, has hired a Title VI coordinator to support the UniversityÃ¢Â€Â™s response to reports of discrimination or harassment and is in the process of developing a mandatory anti-discrimination training.
Strengthening collaborative efforts, Michigan State University has convened a monthly gathering of colleagues to discuss issues of student safety. The University has also launched a DEI Foundations learning module that includes discussions of antisemitism.
SUNY PurchaseÃ¢Â€Â™s new Ã¢Â€Â˜Diversity DefinedÃ¢Â€Â™ resource firmly prohibits antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination, while simultaneously rejecting BDS.
Prioritizing research efforts, CUNY Queens College has sought to assess antisemitism on campus through surveys and focus groups. The College is also working with theÃ‚Â Jewish Community Relations Council Community Security Initiative to improve public safety.
CUNY Brooklyn College has strengthened campus protest policies, organized regular Emergency Response Team meetings and has developed new orientation training that addresses antisemitism.
In advance of the new academic year, the University of Colorado, Boulder amended its protected-class definitions webpage to explicitly prohibit antisemitism, Islamophobia and caste. This month, the University also de-recognized the campus SJP chapter.
Barnard College amended the Expectations for Community Conduct policy to note that Ã¢Â€Âœsubstituting the word Ã¢Â€Â˜ZionistÃ¢Â€Â™ as a proxy for Ã¢Â€Â˜JewishÃ¢Â€Â™ or Ã¢Â€Â˜Israeli,Ã¢Â€Â™ for example, may constitute prohibited discrimination.Ã¢Â€Â
Wellesley CollegeÃ‚Â is providing anti-religious bias training to all residential life and orientation staffÃ‚Â and has mandated Title VI training for all first years and other incoming students.
New York University has launched a university-wide mandatory training that includes examples of conduct that would be considered discrimination against Jews or Israelis. The University was also the first to update its policy to explicitly underscore that code words like Ã¢Â€Â˜ZionistÃ¢Â€Â™ could result in conduct violations.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen we first launched the Campus Antisemitism Report Card, we urged university leaders to use the grades they received as motivation to do better and improve their scores, and in the cases of these 10 schools the progress has been demonstrable,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœThese universitiesÃ¢Â€Â™ recent efforts and policies should lay the foundation for continued progress and should serve as a model for other schools to follow.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL encourages these schools, and all colleges and universities, to continue their efforts in the ongoing fight against campus antisemitism, both via policy changes and through the consistent and balanced enforcement of said policies. Doing so sends an important message to their campus communities: antisemitism has no place on our campuses.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe encourage these schools, and all colleges and universities, to continue their efforts in the ongoing fight against campus antisemitism,Ã¢Â€Â said Shira Goodman, ADL Vice President of Advocacy. Ã¢Â€ÂœThere is much more work to be done to ensure that our campuses have no tolerance for antisemitism.Ã¢Â€Â","[3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.8, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

From her dorm room, she heard chants of Ã¢Â€Âœfree Palestine,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Âœgenocide supportersÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœfrom the river to the sea.Ã¢Â€Â It was late October 2023. She walked over to an anti-Israel protest on campus and soon realized it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t peaceful, but filled with tension and calls for the destruction of Israel and Jewish people. A red pickup truck sped by with a group of men holding a lighter to an Israeli flag. One of MarleyÃ¢Â€Â™s friends tried to grab the flag out of their hands. His nose ended up broken after he was hit in the face with a megaphone.

It was the first time Marley felt threatened as a Jewish college student, though she continued proudly to wear her Jewish star.

Ã¢Â€ÂœAs the days went on and my friendÃ¢Â€Â™s nose was healing, I thought back to my path of becoming a person who believes in the need for social justice. For four years I was a teen mentor for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). I encountered antisemitism from an early age. I felt confused and saddened, struggling to understand why someone disliked me without even knowing me,Ã¢Â€Â Marley wrote.

After the anti-Israel protest, she and her Jewish friends found solace in community, being there for one another and spending Shabbats together at Hillel or Chabad. As the campus protests and encampments escalated in the spring, Marley realized addressing a lack of education about the issues is key.

Back in her hometown in Connecticut after the school year ended, she was disappointed and angry that the community wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t raising awareness around antisemitism. She felt compelled to do something and reached out to ADL, remembering her experiences as a teen mentor.

Once she became an ADL summer intern, she felt better equipped to remain calm in the face of upsetting comments. She learned how to counter antisemitism through her work at ADL such as strategies and specific language to use when faced with that hate.

Marley is back on campus for her sophomore year. She said it feels good to be there. Every Sunday, there is a walk when participants wear Israeli flags, carry signs of the hostages and read out their names. She described it as peaceful and as a way to show support for Israel and raise awareness.

She has already spent Shabbats at Chabad, even showing up early to help set up and spend time with the rabbi and his family. She hopes to continue surrounding herself within the Jewish community.

As cases of antisemitism soar in the UK, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have launched a new free digital resource to teach secondary school students about Jews, Judaism and antisemitism. This initiative addresses the urgent need for improved anti-hate educational programs in schools, especially given the worrying increase in antisemitic incidents among younger demographics.

Jewish Living Online (JLO), developed by the Board of Deputies of British Jews in partnership with ADL, is a comprehensive, authentic and engaging resource for students aged 11 and over. It provides information via multimedia content (including real British Jewish voices), discussion, and critical thinking questions and assessment tools.Ã‚Â 

The first iteration is designed to fit in with the standard curriculum for KS3 (11-14 years) and above. There are plans to expand the project to include Welsh, Scottish, and Northern Irish variants in compliance with their respective national guidelines and language requirements.

The unique technology stack was developed in-house by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and will form the foundation of future work by the Board and partners in the online education space. A future teacher training module for JLO is also planned.

ADL CEO and National Director, Jonathan Greenblatt, said:Ã‚Â 

""Unfortunately, the UK is no exception to the global tsunami of antisemitism we've witnessed over the past year. To combat this rise in hatred, ADL is proud to launch Jewish Living Online in partnership with the Board of Deputies of British Jews. This initiative marks the first of many similar programs we plan to implement globally, aimed at educating and empowering the next generation. By providing teachers and students with essential tools to understand and confront antisemitism, we are taking a vital step toward a future where antisemitism and hate have no place in our communities.""

Board of Deputies President Phil Rosenberg said:Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
Ã¢Â€ÂœIn the context of an alarming rise in antisemitism in the UK, and in particular, a worrying increase in incidents among young people, the need for improved education in schools could not be more urgent. It is our firm belief that educating about antisemitism must also begin with a foundational knowledge of who Jews are as a people, what Judaism is, our history, language and culture. We developed our free Jewish Living Online resource together with our partners at ADL, and in consultation with leading educators, policy makers, school leaders, and researchers. This is a groundbreaking course which will both engage and inform the attitudes of the next generation.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/adl-debunk-false-narratives-around-2024-presidential-election,"False and misleading narratives about the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election are spreading widely among extremists and purveyors of hate and conspiracy theories.

While some of the most common mis- and disinformation narratives circulating today were also prominent during theÃ‚Â 2020 election and theÃ‚Â 2022 midterms, others are newer Ã¢Â€Â” inspired by current events in America and around the world. These narratives are also being deployed using a range of strategies and tactics that allow misleading content to fly under the radar.

Strategies and tactics

Foreign influence campaigns have already impacted the information landscape surrounding the election. In one recent and notable case, the Department of Justice seized 32 internet domains created by the Russian government to spread propaganda and disinformation in an operation colloquially known as Doppelganger, which aimed in part to influence voter sentiment in foreign elections and the U.S. presidential election, according to a September 2024 Justice DepartmentÃ‚Â announcement.

Many of the domains were created via Ã¢Â€Âœcybersquatting,Ã¢Â€Â or registering misleading domains disguised as legitimate news websites. In the case of Doppelganger, these domains used trademarked logos and even the bylines of real journalists to spread fabricated articles Ã¢Â€Â” some of which promoted narratives related to how the U.S. government handles foreign and domestic issues and security threats.

An example of a fake Ã¢Â€ÂœFox NewsÃ¢Â€Â domain from Doppelganger. (Source: DOJ)

Ã‚Â 

One of the Doppelganger projects specifically targeted American citizens in swing states, Ã¢Â€ÂœUS citizens of Hispanic descent,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerican JewsÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerican gamersÃ¢Â€Â on sites like Reddit and 4chan. Another campaign aimed to sway public opinion among the Jewish diaspora in the U.S. and Israel by framing Ukraine as a neo-Nazi-aligned enemy and drawing ""parallels between Russia and Israel."" One part of the planning document reads, ""influencing the public opinion of Israel will impact the public opinion of Jewish voters in the US.Ã¢Â€Â

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) content has also been weaponized to spread election-related disinformation. In January 2024,Ã‚Â robocalls using synthetic speech of President Joe BidenÃ¢Â€Â™s voice discouraged New Hampshire voters from voting in the primary election, which was scheduled two days later. In a February 2024Ã‚Â statement, the New Hampshire Attorney GeneralÃ¢Â€Â™s office called the maneuver a form of Ã¢Â€Âœvoter suppression.Ã¢Â€Â

An excerpt from a robocall using synthetic speech of Joe Biden's voice, aired on CNN. (Source: CNN)

Ã‚Â 

On January 31, 2024, pollster Patrick Ruffini posted what appeared to be photos of Black men canvassing for the Republican party with a caption on X that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœRepublican victory in 2024 depends on their being able to do this.Ã¢Â€Â The images, however, wereÃ‚Â AI-generated Ã¢Â€Â” a tactic that many users mocked and denounced after the fact. After widespread ridicule, Ruffini deleted the post.

Ã‚Â 

One problematic side effect of increasingly convincing GAI content is the ability for people to cast doubt on the validity of authentic content Ã¢Â€Â” a phenomenon often referred to asÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Âœthe liarÃ¢Â€Â™s dividend,Ã¢Â€Â which is also contributing to misinformation campaigns.

In August 2024, conspiratorial influencers suggested that images of the crowd at a Kamala Harris rally in Michigan were CGI or AI-generated, in a supposed effort by her campaign to inflate her popularity. This claim is easilyÃ‚Â debunkable Ã¢Â€Â” the rally was covered by numerous media outlets, the photographs in question are available on sites like Getty Images and journalists reported thousands of people in the crowd.

Regardless of the method by which they are spread, false and misleading election narratives are designed to achieve a common goal: To sow distrust in the democratic process and call into question the validity of the election results.

The ADL Center on Extremism has tracked the following prominent false narratives surrounding the upcoming election.
Ã‚Â 
False narratives about the 2024 election

FALSE NARRATIVE #1: Immigrants are helping Democrats steal the election

One of the most popular election fraud narratives alleges that large volumes of non-citizens have successfully registered to vote and are helping to Ã¢Â€ÂœstealÃ¢Â€Â the election in favor of Kamala Harris. Some have claimed that the Biden administration has been deliberately coordinating the influx of migrants to help achieve this goal.

Ã‚Â 

In early September 2024, extremists and conspiracy theorists spread the false narrative that Haitian migrant communities in Springfield, Ohio, were killing and eating domestic pets. While not overtly election-related at first, the false claim quickly gained traction as political fodder Ã¢Â€Â” in most cases, to fuel the theory that Haitian migrants were specifically imported into swing states by the Biden administration to ensure a Harris win.

Ã‚Â 

Conspiracy theorists have also expressed concerns about a lack of Ã¢Â€Âœvoter IDÃ¢Â€Â laws Ã¢Â€Â” as in, laws requiring voters to present valid ID at polling places, regardless of their prior registration status. Many claim that Democrats are outlawing these requirements because it will allow non-citizens to vote and make the election easier to steal.

REALITY:Ã‚Â These claims are unfounded and advance the broader narrative that the election is being systematically rigged while demonizing innocent migrant communities. Undocumented migrants or migrants who are not U.S. citizensÃ‚Â cannot legally register to vote, and therefore cannot influence election results. Also, eligible voters already go through a thorough identification process when they initially register. In several states like California Ã¢Â€Â” where Ã¢Â€Âœvoter IDÃ¢Â€Â laws have been highly debated Ã¢Â€Â” registered voters areÃ‚Â not typically required to bring additional identification to polling places when they cast their ballots.

FALSE NARRATIVE #2: Jews, Zionists and Israel control the election results

A common talking point among antisemitic extremists and conspiracy theorists has long been that JewsÃ‚Â control the U.S. government. Now, these groups are also promoting the false narrative that Jews, Zionists and Israel control U.S. elections.

Members of extremist groups, including neo-Nazis and white supremacists, have suggested that the winning candidate will ultimately be determined by Ã¢Â€Âœthe Jews.Ã¢Â€Â Antisemitic influencerÃ‚Â Lucas Gage recently suggested that so-called Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish supremacyÃ¢Â€Â is such a systemic issue across all candidates that voting is futile and that only an alternative political system can combat its influence.

Ã‚Â 

Across the political spectrum, influencers have also suggested that Israel is meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Sulaiman Ahmed, anÃ‚Â anti-Zionist commentator and promoter of anti-Israel disinformation, alleged that Israel forced Joe Biden out of the 2024 presidential race to assert its control over the U.S.

Ã‚Â 

REALITY: These false claims are merely iterations of classicÃ‚Â antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and control. Extremists and antisemites spread them to corroborate the false narrative that there is a disproportionate influence of Jewish power in American politics, weaponizing the current discourse surrounding Israel to validate their claims.

FALSE NARRATIVE #3: Kamala Harris lied about her identity, credibility and eligibility to run for president

After Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July 2024, some conspiracy theorists alleged that he was illegitimately removed by the Democratic Party to more convincingly Ã¢Â€ÂœstealÃ¢Â€Â the election from Republican contender Donald Trump. This claim helped fuel the many narratives disputing Kamala HarrisÃ¢Â€Â™s eligibility as a presidential candidate.

Many questioned her credibility by sowing doubt in her status as an American citizen, invoking claims like the Ã¢Â€ÂœbirtherÃ¢Â€Â theories that surrounded former president Barack Obama. ThisÃ‚Â accusation against Harris also circulated during the 2020 election cycle.

Ã‚Â 

Far-right commentator Matt Walsh pushed a sexist talking point by suggesting she Ã¢Â€Âœslept her way to the top,Ã¢Â€Â while others questioned her identity as a Black woman. Conspiracy theorists also latched onto the narrative that HarrisÃ¢Â€Â™s campaign is part of a media-coordinated Ã¢Â€Âœpsyop,Ã¢Â€Â claiming that the media has somehow fabricated HarrisÃ¢Â€Â™s popularity to make her look like a more formidable opponent.

Ã‚Â 

REALITY:Ã‚Â Harris is, in fact, an American citizen. She wasÃ‚Â born in California and identifies as bothÃ‚Â Black and Asian-American. False claims alleging that she Ã¢Â€Âœslept her wayÃ¢Â€Â to her current status are common misogynistic tropes, typically used to discredit women in positions of power.

FALSE NARRATIVE #4: The Trump assassination attempts were staged or Ã¢Â€Âœinside jobsÃ¢Â€Â

On July 13, 2024,Ã‚Â Thomas Matthew Crooks carried out an assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Two months later, on September 15, 2024, the FBI thwarted another assassination attempt on Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida by Ryan Wesley Routh, who was arrested at the scene.

Left-wing conspiracy theorists quickly cast doubt on the authenticity of the well-documented incidents, suggesting that TrumpÃ¢Â€Â™s own associates staged the attempts as a campaign strategy. In far-right and extremist spaces online, users suggested that the Democratic Party, Israel, Ã¢Â€ÂœJewsÃ¢Â€Â or theÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Âœdeep stateÃ¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â carried out the attempts themselves.

Ã‚Â 

REALITY:Ã‚Â There isÃ‚Â no evidence supporting the claims that the assassination attempts against Trump were fake, nor is there any indication that they were planned by anyone but the would-be assassins themselves. Such narratives are common among conspiracy theorists following newsworthy or violent incidents, which they leverage to promote their own political ideologies.

FALSE NARRATIVE #5: The government is weaponizing or creating hurricanes to interfere with the electionÃ‚Â 

In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene swept through the southeast, hitting states like Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. Severe flooding decimated parts of western North Carolina, leading toÃ‚Â widespread damage, power outages and even deaths.

Conspiracy theories about the hurricane and the Federal Emergency Management AgencyÃ¢Â€Â™s (FEMA) response emerged shortly after. Far-right commentators like Jack Posobiec capitalized on the opportunity to politicize the subject, suggesting that the government was blocking relief and aid to victims of Helene as a form of Ã¢Â€Âœvoter suppression.Ã¢Â€Â On X, Islamophobic commentatorÃ‚Â Laura Loomer asked if the aftermath was part of Ã¢Â€Âœplanned mass chaosÃ¢Â€Â from the Biden administration.

Ã‚Â 

Some suggested the hurricane itself was a product of a nefarious weather control conspiracy. Antisemitic influencer Stew Peters expressed his suspicion that the federal government Ã¢Â€Âœlearned how to manipulate weatherÃ¢Â€Â to target Ã¢Â€Âœmostly white, Republican votersÃ¢Â€Â right before the election. Similar theories continued to spread around October 9, 2024, when Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.

Ã‚Â 

REALITY:Ã‚Â FEMA and the U.S. government are notÃ‚Â restricting aid to Hurricane Helene victims; this was one of many conspiracy theories about FEMA in the wake of Helene, which prompted the organization to set up a dedicatedÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœHurricane Rumor ResponseÃ¢Â€Â page on their website. The government was not involved in the production orÃ‚Â manipulation of these hurricanes, as humansÃ‚Â cannot control or create extreme weather phenomena.

FALSE NARRATIVE #6: Ã¢Â€ÂœBallot traffickingÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœballot harvestingÃ¢Â€Â will lead to large volumes of fraudulent ballots

Widely popularized in 2020, this theory suggests that surveillance footage from recent elections shows evidence of individuals depositing large quantities of fraudulent ballots in drop boxes to falsely inflate votes for a single candidate. This narrative was also prevalent during theÃ‚Â 2022 midterms, leading to organized Ã¢Â€Âœdrop box monitoringÃ¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â parties. The claim continues to be promoted ahead of November.

Ã‚Â 

REALITY:Ã‚Â These theories have been widely debunked. Footage of alleged Ã¢Â€Âœballot traffickingÃ¢Â€Â shows voters taking part in the normal process of placing ballots in local drop box locations. It is not unusual for an individual to drop off several ballots at once; inÃ‚Â most states, family members or other authorized individuals may drop off a ballot for someone who is not able to do so on their own.

FALSE NARRATIVE #7: Delayed election results are false election results

This longstanding election fraud narrative, popular in both 2020 and 2022, suggests that delays in reporting election results are evidence of nefarious behind-the-scenes attempts to swing the election. Promoters of this theory, which include QAnon adherents and general election fraud conspiracy theorists, have argued that these delays make it easier to commit election fraud and give bad actors more time to tamper with ballots.

Ã‚Â 

REALITY:Ã‚Â Laws determining when and how election workers can start processing votes vary by state.Ã‚Â Alabama, for example, does not allow the counting of absentee or mail-in ballots to begin until after the polls close on election day. These rulesÃ‚Â can also changeÃ‚Â between election cycles if amendments are made to existing laws.

FALSE NARRATIVE #8: Electronic voting machines are programmed to change votesÃ‚Â 

Around October 18, 2024, new allegations supposedly from early voters in Georgia suggested that Dominion voting machines were switching their Trump votes to Harris votes.

Ã‚Â 

REALITY:Ã‚Â This theory is not new and was repeatedlyÃ‚Â debunked when it first circulated in 2020. Dominion has sinceÃ‚Â addressed and dispelled the recent allegations, citing Ã¢Â€Âœvoter errorÃ¢Â€Â as the cause.

FALSE NARRATIVE #9: Michigan has more registered voters than citizens, suggesting fraud

On October 19, 2024, viral posts on sites like X, Rumble and more alleged that the state of Michigan has more registered voters than eligible citizens, implying that the state is at heightened risk of voter fraud. One post spreading this claim received at least 30 million views.

Ã‚Â 

REALITY:Ã‚Â Michigan Secretary of StateÃ‚Â Jocelyn Benson debunked the narrative shortly after it emerged, clarifying that Michigan has Ã¢Â€Âœ7.2 million active registered voters and 7.9 [million] citizens of voting age.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/francesca-albanese-her-own-words,"Francesca Albanese, appointed in May 2022 as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, has long coopted antisemitic tropes and legitimized support of terrorism in her critiques of Israel, using her platform to spread intense anti-Israel rhetoric. She is the first Special Rapporteur to be condemned by both Germany and France for antisemitism, and has been condemned by the U.S. Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and U.S. Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council, MichÃƒÂ¨le Taylor.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

UN Human Rights Council Special Procedures Mandate-holders or Special Rapporteurs, are independent experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, tasked with investigating human rights in an area or topic. Special Rapporteurs are bound by their Code of Conduct to, Ã¢Â€Âœ...ensure that their personal political opinions are without prejudice to the execution of their mission, and base their conclusions and recommendations on objective assessments of human rights situations.Ã¢Â€Â Special Rapporteurs must also, Ã¢Â€ÂœIn implementing their mandate, therefore, show restraint, moderation and discretion so as not to undermine the recognition of the independent nature of their mandate or the environment necessary to properly discharge the said mandate.Ã¢Â€Â From the start Francesca AlbaneseÃ¢Â€Â™s bias and lack of impartiality towards Israel has been obvious. She has a long record of promoting antisemitic tropes and using hateful language to attack the Jewish State of Israel, which includes comparing Israel to the Nazis, conspiracies about Jewish power, denying and diminishing the Oct 7th massacre, and supporting and advocating violence against the Jewish state.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Below are select antisemitic and/or inflammatory statements from Albanese:Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Holocaust Distortion, Trivialization and Comparisons to Nazis

On October 14, 2024, Albanese likened the systematic extermination of Jews under the NaziÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€Âœpure raceÃ¢Â€Â policy to IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s war on Hamas in Gaza. Albanese compares the Jewish StateÃ¢Â€Â™s war against Hamas, to the Ã¢Â€ÂœThird ReichÃ¢Â€Â who perpetrated the Holocaust, tweeting: Ã¢Â€ÂœOur collective obliviousness to what led, 100 years ago, to the Third ReichÃ¢Â€Â™s expansionism and the genocide of people not in conformity with the Ã¢Â€Âœpure raceÃ¢Â€Â is asinine. And it is leading to the commission of yet another genocide...Ã¢Â€Â

In August 2024, in a tweet addressed to the German government, Albanese likened GermanyÃ¢Â€Â™s actions and German civilianÃ¢Â€Â™s complacency during the Holocaust under the Third Reich, to GermanyÃ¢Â€Â™s support of Israel claiming, Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is 2024 and while you could stay quite [sic] and silent in the corner of history, you are doing all you can to make it wrong, once again.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

In August 2024, Albanese likened IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s war on the Gaza strip to the Holocaust, calling it a Ã¢Â€Âœconcentration camp of the 21st century.Ã¢Â€Â

In July 2024, Albanese trivialized the Holocaust, reposting an image comparing Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, with the comment: Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is precisely what I was thinking today.Ã¢Â€Â

In December 2023, Albanese compared the IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s war in Gaza to the Holocaust saying: Ã¢Â€ÂœFellow Europeans, Italians, Germans: after the Holocaust, we should instinctively know that Genocide starts with dehumanizing the Other. If Israel's current attack agst [sic] Palestinians doesnt [sic] prompt our strong reaction, the darkest page of our recent history has taught us nothing.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Conspiracies about Jewish power

October 2024, Albanese retweeted with the caption Ã¢Â€ÂœA must-read for the ages...Ã¢Â€Â a tweet from Chris Hedges that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœI fear, given that the Israel lobby has bought and paid for Congress and the two ruling parties, as well as cowed the media and universities, the rivers of blood will continue to swell. There is money to be made in war. A lot of it. And the influence of the war industry, buttressed by hundreds of millions of dollars spent on political campaigns by the Zionists, will be a formidable barrier to peace, not to mention sanity.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

Demonization and Delegitimization of Israel

In August 2024, Albanese labeled the targeted Israeli assassinations of terrorist leaders, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr, as Ã¢Â€ÂœmurdersÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœacts of aggression.Ã¢Â€Â

In July 2024, Albanese compared Israel to the terrorist rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan, after the Taliban banned the UN Special Rapporteur for Afghanistan from entering the country, stating: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Taliban displays the same disdain toward the UN and its values as IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s Apartheid.Ã¢Â€Â In Taliban ruled Afghanistan, women are banned from speaking or showing their faces in public.

In June 2024, Albanese claimed Ã¢Â€Âœgenocidal intentÃ¢Â€Â in the Israeli rescue efforts to free four hostages kidnapped from Israel into Gaza by Hamas terrorists.

July 2024, Albanese tweeted Ã¢Â€ÂœTime to #UNseatIsrael from the UN.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

Denying or Diminishing the Oct. 7th Massacre

In March 2024, Albanese diminished the reality and suffering of Israeli women on International WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Day without reference to those who were murdered, dehumanized, kidnapped and raped by Hamas: Ã¢Â€ÂœMy thoughts also go to the Israeli women, especially the soldiers: what have you done, what have you become. Dears, when you realise it, you will be haunted forever.Ã¢Â€Â

In February 2024, in response to French President Emmanuel Macron referring to the October 7 massacre as Ã¢Â€Âœthe largest antisemitic massacre of our century,Ã¢Â€Â Albanese tweeted: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe greatest antisemitic massacre of our century? No, @EmmanuelMacron. The victims of 7/10 were not killed because of their Judaism but in response to IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s oppression.Ã¢Â€Â For this statement, the governments of France and Germany condemned Albanese for her antisemitism, making it the first time in UN history that both France and Germany condemn a UN rapporteur for antisemitism.Ã‚Â 

France responding: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe October 7 massacre is the largest anti-Semitic massacre of the 21st century. To deny it is wrong. To seem to justify it, by bringing in the name of the United Nations, is a shame.Ã¢Â€Â Adding that, Ã¢Â€ÂœThese remarks are all the more scandalous given that the fight against anti-Semitism and all forms of racism are at the heart of the founding of the UN.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Germany also replied to AlbaneseÃ¢Â€Â™s comments, stating: Ã¢Â€ÂœTo justify the horrific terror attacks of 7/10 & deny their antisemitic nature is appalling. Making such statements in a UN capacity is a disgrace and goes against everything the United Nations stand for.Ã¢Â€Â

During a webinar, while discussing the October 7 massacre, Albanese said: Ã¢Â€ÂœThere might have been people carrying out the attack who might have been motivated by hatred. But the attack itself, and this is the thing, there is something like intent at the level of the attack, and all the statements that were collected at the level of command have not pointed to aggression against the Jews. There is another point that in Arabic, Palestinians refer to the Israelis as Yahudis and the Israelis refer to the Palestinians like the Arabs. This is something that shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t escape a western audience. It is a way to refer interchangeably to the Israelis.Ã¢Â€Â

In October 2023, following the brutal massacre perpetrated by Hamas, Albanese called into question HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ crimes Ã¢Â€Âœincluding beheadings/rape.Ã¢Â€Â

On October 7 2023, the day that Hamas targeted IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s civilian populations massacring of over 1,200 people and kidnapping 250, AlbaneseÃ¢Â€Â™s reaction was to minimize HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ atrocities stating that, Ã¢Â€ÂœTodayÃ¢Â€Â™s violence must be put in context.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Justification of Violence

In a November 2022 response to a Hamas-organized conference in Gaza, Albanese said Ã¢Â€Âœyou have the right to resist this occupation.Ã¢Â€Â

In June 2022, Albanese stated that Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Palestinians have no other room for dissent than violence,Ã¢Â€Â justifying violence against Israel.

Upon the start of her term as Special Rapporteur in May 2022, Albanese began to justify terrorist violence stating: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Palestinian violence that we see is inevitable because for 55 years, almost three generations, the right to exist of a people has been denied.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

AlbaneseÃ¢Â€Â™s antisemitism prior to her UN appointment

In 2014, in a post since hidden from her Facebook page, Albanese employs antisemitic tropes in an open letter to the BBC stating that: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Israeli lobby is clearly inside your veins and system,Ã¢Â€Â claiming of an Ã¢Â€Âœorwellian [sic] nightmare caused once again by IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s greed.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

In 2014, Albanese expressed excitement on Facebook that Hamas was removed from the list of terror organizations by the EU General Court: Ã¢Â€ÂœTwo good news one after another from the radio while I was taking a nap. Normalization in the relations usa cuba [sic] and removal of hamas [sic] from the list of terror organizations. Was i [sic] dreaming???Ã¢Â€Â The EUÃ¢Â€Â™s decision to declassify Hamas as a terrorist organization was overturned by the European Court of Justice (EJC) in 2017.

In 2014, Albanese stated: Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerica and Europe, one of them subjugated by the Jewish lobby, and the other by the sense of guilt about the Holocaust.Ã¢Â€Â When uncovered in 2022, AlbaneseÃ¢Â€Â™s comments were condemned by US Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt as Ã¢Â€Âœblatantly antisemitic.Ã¢Â€Â Albanese has since said that she regrets this remark.","[2, 4, 5]","{1: 0.0, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.9, 6: 0.0}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/anti-israel-activists-pay-tribute-107-architect-yahya-sinwar-reflecting-pattern,"After Israeli military forces killed Hamas leader and October 7 architect Yahya Sinwar in Gaza on October 16, 2024, U.S. anti-Israel activists quickly responded with praise and veneration for the terrorist who masterminded the deaths of approximately 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals and the abduction of some 250 people just over one year ago. Student groups, including numerous chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), were among the loudest voices memorializing Sinwar with sympathetic, pro-Hamas statements and social media posts.

These openly pro-terror responses fit into a pattern of behavior from many in the anti-Israel movement who have repeatedly glorified and celebrated notorious terrorists, both online and on the ground since the October 7 attack. In recent months, in particular, similar responses have followed the assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September 2024 and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in July 2024.

This most recent wave of support for infamous terror group leaders demonstrates how, as ADL has frequently documented, many activist groups that claim to be simply Ã¢Â€Âœanti-IsraelÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœanti-ZionistÃ¢Â€Â in fact openly revel in violence against and the murder of civilians Ã¢Â€Â” and Jews in particular Ã¢Â€Â” in Israel.

Anti-Israel Activists Memorialize Sinwar

Student Groups

Dozens of chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and other campus groups were among those explicitly supportive of Sinwar after his death, reposting hagiographies, obituaries, and images of him with captions like Ã¢Â€Âœglory to our martyrsÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœrest in power.Ã¢Â€Â Some of these posts also incorporated additional violent rhetoric and imagery, including of weapons and inverted red triangles (a symbol popularized by Hamas to mark targets).

Upon the news of SinwarÃ¢Â€Â™s death, students in the City University of New York (CUNY) system praised the terror chief and shared other pro-terror content in a recently launched, self-described Ã¢Â€Âœunapologetically pro-resistance, anonymous telegram channel,Ã¢Â€Â titled Ã¢Â€ÂœCunyResists.Ã¢Â€Â The first two posts on the channel featured photographs of Sinwar and a lengthy message memorializing him and other recently killed terrorist group leaders. It read, in part:

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe news regarding the great commander has left our hearts heavy and out [sic] chests breathless. Today, we mourn the loss and celebrate the martyrdom of the lion of Al Quds, the beloved Commander, President, Fighter, his eminence, Yahya SinwarÃ¢Â€Â¦Every kuffiyeh drawn on the neck of a CUNY student is tied to the neck of the great commander who woke up the world from their deep daze. We tell the Zionist entity that your assassinations have never worked in the past and they will not work today. From Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin [Hamas founder, killed in 2004] to Sheikh Ismael Haniyah. Hundreds more will rise to take their placeÃ¢Â€Â¦Indeed it is a Jihad of victory or martyrdom.Ã¢Â€Â

University of Washington SJP-affiliate Students United for Palestinian Equality & Return (SUPER) reposted a pro-Hamas statement about Sinwar from Samidoun Ã¢Â€Â” an anti-Israel organization recently sanctioned by the U.S. government for acting as an Ã¢Â€Âœinternational fundraiserÃ¢Â€Â for the U.S.-designated terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) Ã¢Â€Â” with the message Ã¢Â€ÂœGlory to the martyr Yahya Sinwar.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â

Ã‚Â 

The Philadelphia SJP coalition Ã¢Â€Â” which consists of anti-Israel student groups from Bryn Mawr College, Drexel University, Haverford College, Swarthmore College, Temple University, the University of Pennsylvania and Villanova University Ã¢Â€Â” reposted a biography of Sinwar and added the caption: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe will honor all our martyrs. It is right to resist.Ã¢Â€Â Central Florida SJP, which is active at but not officially recognized by the University of Central Florida, shared a Sinwar interview clip with the added caption: Ã¢Â€ÂœGlory to our martyrs.Ã¢Â€Â

SJP at the University of Virginia posted a photograph of Sinwar pulling a pistol from his waistband, overlaid with the text: Ã¢Â€ÂœPeace be upon you, a prisoner, a leader, a fighter, a martyr.Ã¢Â€Â At the University of California, Berkeley, the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s SJP chapter also posted the image of Sinwar with the pistol and other messages glorifying Sinwar, while Bears for Palestine, another anti-Israel student group, posted an image of Sinwar kneeling with a rifle.

The SJP chapter at California State University, Los Angeles, reposted a tweet reading, Ã¢Â€ÂœOne manÃ¢Â€Â™s terrorist is another manÃ¢Â€Â™s freedom fighter.Ã¢Â€Â At Cal Poly Pomona, the campus SJP reposted an interview of Sinwar, captioning it: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe face of the resistance. Martyred while fighting for our liberation. Rest in powerÃ¢Â€Â alongside an inverted red triangle.

The SJP chapter at California State University, Northridge, reposted a video of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s military wing) spokesperson Abu ObaidaÃ¢Â€Â™s speech from a few days earlier, on the anniversary of October 7, speaking about how assassinations will not deter Hamas. The SJP at California State University, Long Beach, reposted a well-known photograph of Sinwar taken amid the 2021 escalation between Israel and Hamas, showing him sitting in an armchair in Gaza with the ruins of his former house in the background, and added a burning heart emoji over the image.

Multiple Columbia University student groups, including SJP and Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), posted about Sinwar, including sharing a digital copy of his book and posting various quotations and video clips of him outlining HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s decision Ã¢Â€Âœto defend our people with whatever weapons we have.Ã¢Â€Â Wellesley SJP also made a series of Sinwar-related posts, including sharing photographs, interview content and messages declaring, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo matter how many leaders they take, new ones will rise; The resistance will never die.Ã¢Â€Â

Community Groups and Other Activists

Numerous other anti-Israel groups shared similar praise for Sinwar. New York-based extreme anti-Zionist group Within Our Lifetime (WOL) published an obituary for the Hamas leader that was further shared by many community and campus groups. The WOL statement praised Sinwar as Ã¢Â€Âœa fierce leader who did not waver, but advanced the struggle until his very last breathÃ¢Â€Â and who Ã¢Â€Âœwas a key figure who united the fields against zionism [sic].Ã¢Â€Â The statement declared that SinwarÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€Âœlegacy will live on in the hearts of every revolutionaryÃ¢Â€Â and that Ã¢Â€Âœthese enduring ideas, deeply rooted in the people of Palestine, will drive the struggle forward until the zionist [sic] entity is dismantled.Ã¢Â€Â

Another NY-based anti-Zionist group, PAL-Awda NY/NJ (a merger of the Palestinian Assembly for Liberation and Al-Awda NY/NJ), also shared a statement in honor of the Ã¢Â€ÂœmartyrdomÃ¢Â€Â of Sinwar, declaring that he Ã¢Â€Âœlived a hero and died a legendÃ¢Â€Â and that his Ã¢Â€Âœname will go down in history as a symbol of resistance and liberation.Ã¢Â€Â It characterized his death as marking both a Ã¢Â€Âœmoment of mourningÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœa moment to recognize the dismantling tentacles of the zionist [sic] entity,Ã¢Â€Â adding that, Ã¢Â€Âœthe legacy of Yahya Sinwar is a powerful testament to resilience and resistance, destined to birth millions of Sinwars.Ã¢Â€Â

Individual activists and influencers also weighed in with praise for Sinwar. Daniel Haqiqatjou, an antisemitic conspiracy theorist who founded the online publication Muslim Skeptic, shared the popular photograph of Sinwar holding a pistol and wrote: Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen Sinwar accepted leadership, he accepted inevitable martyrdom. O Muslims, that is the necessary quality any leader worth following must have.Ã¢Â€Â Jackson Hinkle, a far-right commentator and influencer who posts extensive antisemitic and anti-Israel content, posted a photograph of Sinwar on X and wrote: Ã¢Â€ÂœYahya Sinwar put death before dishonorÃ¢Â€Â alongside broken heart and Palestinian flag emojis.

Anti-Zionist Rutgers University professor Noura Erakat shared several posts on X and Instagram lionizing Sinwar, including one calling him an Ã¢Â€Âœimmortal legend.Ã¢Â€Â Ali Abunimah, co-founder and executive director of the anti-Zionist publication Electronic Intifada, wrote on X: Ã¢Â€ÂœSinwar died as he would wish, fighting honorably with and for his people, against the evils of Zionism, colonialism and genocide.Ã¢Â€Â He added in another post: Ã¢Â€ÂœSinwar already defeated Ã¢Â€Â˜IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™ on 7 October, destroying forever its myth of invincibility, and changing history. He set Palestine on the road to liberation from the evil of Zionism and generations yet unborn will thank him.Ã¢Â€Â

On-the-Ground Activities

In addition to the countless posts memorializing Sinwar online after his death, anti-Israel protesters and vandals also marked SinwarÃ¢Â€Â™s passing with offline actions. At an anti-Israel protest in New York City on October 18, for example, multiple protesters held up photographs of Sinwar.

On the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, graffiti was reportedly drawn on multiple wayfinding signs with the message Ã¢Â€ÂœSINWAR LIVESÃ¢Â€Â alongside an inverted triangle. At least one instance of this graffiti was reportedly in close proximity to the campus Hillel building.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

These recent manifestations of pro-Sinwar sentiment were unsurprising, as even before his death, Sinwar was often honored by anti-Israel protesters. For example, at two Nakba Day protests in New York earlier in the year Ã¢Â€Â” in Queens on May 15 and in Brooklyn on May 18 Ã¢Â€Â” protestersÃ‚Â carried a Samidoun-branded banner featuring an image of Sinwar alongside depictions of Mohammed Deif (Al-Qassam Brigades leader) and Abu Obaida (Al-Qassam Brigades spokesperson). At an anti-Israel protest at Hunter College in New York on June 21, a protester carried a photograph of Sinwar.

Pattern of Pro-Terror Behavior

The veneration of Sinwar follows a predictable pattern of disturbing activity from significant portions of the U.S. anti-Israel movement that have made explicit support for terror a defining characteristic of their activism over the past year. While glorifying individual terrorists Ã¢Â€Â” like PFLP-affiliated Leila Khaled, Ahmad SaÃ¢Â€Â™adat and Walid Daqqa Ã¢Â€Â” is a regular feature of online and on-the-ground anti-Israel demonstrations, the past few months have seen particularly egregious examples of this following the deaths of some of the most prominent terror group leaders in HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s Haniyeh and HezbollahÃ¢Â€Â™s Nasrallah.

Following HaniyehÃ¢Â€Â™s Death

After HaniyehÃ¢Â€Â™s death in Iran on July 31, anti-Israel activists quickly memorialized him online. Among student groups, the UCSD Divest Coalition at the University of California, San Diego, shared a post Ã¢Â€Âœcommemorating the martyrdomÃ¢Â€Â of Haniyeh. The post was originally shared by Masar Badil (also known as the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement), an extreme anti-Zionist international organization that hosts programs with members of U.S.-designated terror organizations and whose leadership includes PFLP and Samidoun-linked Khaled Barakat.

The International Committee of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) published Ã¢Â€Â” and later deleted Ã¢Â€Â” a statement in support of Haniyeh that read, in part: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe mourn and honor the martyrs of Lebanon and Palestine and express our unwavering solidarity with their popular resistance movementsÃ¢Â€Â¦The contributions of these figures to the cause of freedom and justice will not be forgotten and their victories will not be reversed.Ã¢Â€Â

Zahra Billoo, Executive Director of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), wrote on Instagram and X: Ã¢Â€ÂœTonight, we mourn Ismail himself but know his martyrdom is not in vain. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.Ã¢Â€Â Lamis Deek, an anti-Zionist attorney and leader with the organization Al-Awda wrote on X: Ã¢Â€ÂœIf only the western [sic] world knew him as we and all who dealt with him did. He was love and humility and sacrifice incarnate....too good for this world.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

PAL-Awda NY/NJ also memorialized Haniyeh in a statement on social media: Ã¢Â€ÂœAll glory to the martyrs of Palestinian liberation and return! We salute the resistance, their leadership, and unwavering resilience which has shown no peace for the Zionist aggressors.Ã¢Â€Â

PAL-Awda NY/NJ also hosted a vigil to honor Haniyeh on July 31 in Brooklyn, NY, alongside representatives from groups including Neturei Karta, Bay Ridge Solidarity and Mamas 4 A Free Palestine. At the demonstration, protesters held illustrations of Haniyeh and shared remarks honoring him, with one speaker stating: Ã¢Â€ÂœItÃ¢Â€Â™s either victory or martyrdomÃ¢Â€Â¦We salute and honor the Axis of Resistance as the vanguard of the movement for Palestinian liberation. We welcome whatever path it chooses to dismantle the Zionist State.

Ã‚Â 

Protesters displaying imagery or photographs of terrorists Ã¢Â€Â” both dead and living Ã¢Â€Â” has become commonplace at protests, and in New York City in particular. At another NYC protest that same day sponsored by WOL in Times Square, a protester held up photographs of Haniyeh and Nasrallah.

Following NasrallahÃ¢Â€Â™s Death

When Nasrallah was killed in Lebanon on September 27, another wave of memorialization and glorification followed.

Within Our Lifetime (WOL) published a statement on Telegram, mourning Ã¢Â€Âœthe martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Lebanese resistance and a symbol of the steadfast struggle to liberate Palestine.Ã¢Â€Â The statement further read: Ã¢Â€ÂœEven after [NasrallahÃ¢Â€Â™s] martyrdom, his ideas and legacy will remain a beacon of hope for thousands to honor after him.Ã¢Â€Â Other groups, including the SJP chapter at St. JohnÃ¢Â€Â™s University in Queens, NY, shared the WOL statement on their own social media pages.

Student groups at Stony Brook University in New York, including Stony Brook SJP (also known as Stony Brook for Palestine) and Graduate Students for Palestine, posted a joint statement on Instagram on September 28 titled, Ã¢Â€ÂœIN SOLIDARITY WITH LEBANON AGAINST ZIONIST-FASCIST BRUTALITY.Ã¢Â€Â In the statement, the groups commemorated Nasrallah as Ã¢Â€Âœa beacon of light in resistance efforts against the Zionist entityÃ¢Â€Â and praised how, Ã¢Â€Âœunder his leadership, Hezbollah has risen to prominence as a major threat to Ã¢Â€Â˜israelÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ¢Â€Â™ [sic] occupation of Palestine.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

The Stony Brook SJP statement concluded by affirming: Ã¢Â€ÂœAs we have supported the Palestinians in their resistance against the Amerikkkan-backed Zionist entity, SB4Palestine affirms the same support for the people of Lebanon in their fight. We honor the martyrs and stand with the resistance against the imperialist regimes of Ã¢Â€Â˜israelÃ¢Â€Â™ and Amerikkka.Ã¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â

The Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a NY-based anti-Israel group, also published a statement on its website mourning Nasrallah: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe path of resistance is arduous but paved with sacrifices, like Nasrallah's, for justice and liberation. His martyrdom stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of resistanceÃ¢Â€Â¦While we feel the pain of losing a prominent figure, we take pride in his legacy.Ã¢Â€Â

Anti-Israel protesters displayed messages honoring both Nasrallah and Haniyeh at some of the October 5Ã¢Â€Â“6 nationwide Ã¢Â€ÂœDay of ActionÃ¢Â€Â protests to mark the first anniversary of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7, 2023, attack. In Washington, DC, on October 5, a protester displayed a sign depicting Haniyeh and Nasrallah alongside the caption: Ã¢Â€ÂœKilling our leaders only makes us stronger.Ã¢Â€Â

In Houston, TX, on October 5, a protester held a sign that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœResistance is necessary. Peace be upon Sayyed Hassan [Nasrallah] & Ismail Haniyeh.Ã¢Â€Â In Minneapolis, MN, on October 6, a protester displayed a sign featuring photographs of Nasrallah and the message: Ã¢Â€ÂœRest in Power Hassan Nasrallah!Ã¢Â€Â A Seattle, WA, protest on October 13, also featured multiple explicit pro-terror signs, including one that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœGlory to the Martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,Ã¢Â€Â alongside a photograph of Nasrallah.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-death-arch-terrorist-yahya-sinwar-truly-justice-served,"New York, NY, October 17, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the death of Hamas arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar at the hands of an Israel Defense Forces patrol in Gaza. Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

The reported death of arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar at the hands of an ordinary IDF patrol truly is justice served.

As we have seen with the killing of Bin Laden, Baghdadi, Nasrallah, and other evil terrorist masterminds, this is a stark reminder that terror does not pay, and hate does not win.

Indeed, Sinwar was covered in blood. His legacy is little more than death and despair. This outcome is an accomplishment that all people of good faith objectively should embrace.

However, in the hours and days ahead, it seems predictable that anti-Israel zealots, radical anti-Zionists, and hateful antisemites will lionize him. Moreover, if the recent killing of Nasrallah was any kind of foreshadowing, many in the mainstream media will launder his homicidal history and whitewash his evil, genocidal agenda. I will leave it to others to detail his history of murder and terror.

But we cannot turn the page and certainly should not celebrate.

This does not end until all the remaining hostages are returned, including American citizens. These are people whose families and friends were butchered on 10/7. Since that day, they have endured over a year of unimaginable brutality and suffering in Hamas captivity. #BringThemHomeNow.

We also cannot celebrate because there are too many innocents to mourn, too many who have suffered in this war. This starts with the thousands of individuals who were attacked, brutalized, raped, tortured and the 1,200 who were slaughtered on 10/7. It happened to them in their homes, in their cars, at bus stops, at a music festival, in bomb shelters, or in other places. This includes all the Israelis killed in the wave of terror that followed since 10/7, such as the 12 Druze children murdered in cold blood this past summer on a soccer field in Majdal Shams. This also includes the thousands of Palestinian civilians killed in the fighting in Gaza and Lebanon, particularly those who lost their lives because they served as human shields for Hamas and Hezbollah, grotesque organizations that hid their fighters, supplies and weapons in their homes, hospitals, and schools.

We cannot celebrate because there are too many in America, Europe and around the world who seem prepared to carry on SinwarÃ¢Â€Â™s legacy and to continue theÃ‚Â campaign of confrontation and hate that has embroiled our campuses, engulfed our communities, in a tsunami of antisemitism and hate.Ã‚Â  Those who wave Hamas and Hezbollah flags, praising terror organizations with American blood on their hands. Those who intimidate and threaten Jewish people, bullying our children,Ã‚Â boycotting our businesses, vandalizing our synagogues, and maligning our community. We need a zero-tolerance policy on intolerance whether on campuses, in politics, or anywhere. Leaders need to lead and stop this in its tracks.

Finally, we cannot celebrate and truly move forward until there is a plan implemented to push Hezbollah out of Southern Lebanon and an agreed upon plan to rebuild Gaza in a demilitarized manner with a government actually ready to serve the needs of its people and prepared to make peace with Israel. This will require effort on the part of Israel, America, Europe, the Arab countries and perhaps the whole world. But when that happens, that will be the moment when we finally will see a Free Gaza -- free from Hamas, free from hate, free from terror, free for all.

That will be a moment to celebrate.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-welcomes-decision-us-treasury-sanction-samidoun-palestinian-prisoner,"New York, NY, October 15, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the decision by the U.S. Department of the TreasuryÃ¢Â€Â™s Office of Foreign Assets Control, in a joint action with Canada, officially designating the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, or Ã¢Â€ÂœSamidoun,Ã¢Â€Â as a sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe applaud the decision by the U.S. Treasury DepartmentÃ‚Â to sanction the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network. This is an organization that has openly praised the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel and encourages engagement with a radical antisemitic, anti-Zionist social media channel that regularly features pro-Hamas propaganda and violent anti-Israel imagery. This organization should not have the ability to raise funds for terrorism in the United States or in any democracy.

Ã¢Â€ÂœTodayÃ¢Â€Â™s action by Treasury will help to ensure that funds raised through the illicit activities of this sham organization do not reach the hands of terrorists overseas. This action also should serve as a challenge to other anti-Israel groups who collaborate with Samidoun. This is a moment of truth for them to decide whether they will continue to partner with a sham charity that is a front for FPLP fundraising.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe deeply appreciate the governments of the U.S. and Canada for taking action and continuing to seek ways to disrupt the flow of finances to the PFLP, Hamas and other terrorist organizations.Ã¢Â€Â


On multiple occasions ADL has shared intelligence about SamidounÃ¢Â€Â™s activities with Congress and the Administration, and encouraged the government to take action against them. Samidoun chapters in the U.S., Canada and other Western countries campaign on behalf of Palestinians imprisoned in those nations, including those arrested or convicted for alleged involvement in terror activity or Ã¢Â€Âœdirect actions"" for Palestinians, according to the ADL Center on Extremism. The group has been explicit in their support for those convicted and accused of acts related to terrorism.

In July, Oren Segal, Vice President of the ADL Center on Extremism, testified before the Ways and Means Committee and ADL briefed the administration about Samidoun, its rhetorical support for terror, and overlap with PFLP networks and propaganda.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/extremists-co-opt-hurricane-response-blame-israel-incite-storm-hateful-narratives,"Right-wing extremists have been exploiting the devastation surrounding Hurricane Helene Ã¢Â€Â” a storm that has so far claimed the lives of at least 230 people in the southeast U.S. Ã¢Â€Â” and now Hurricane Milton, to advance antisemitic or anti-Israel conspiracy theories that federal disaster assistance has been slow or inadequate because they believe the U.S. is sending funds and personnel to Israel instead.

Extremist groups have a history of participating in disaster relief efforts to garner positive attention, push conspiracy theories and potentially recruit new followers. These types of conspiracy theories areÃ‚Â dangerous as they can lead to violence, put relief workers at risk and undercut public faith in civil society.

In late September and early October, the white supremacist group Patriot FrontÃ‚Â traveled to North Carolina and Florida purportedly to help clear debris from the storm. Patriot Front posted about the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s efforts, claiming that the U.S. government is Ã¢Â€Âœmore interested in the concerns of Israel than they are of the Appalachian people,Ã¢Â€Â while their assistance represented a true Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerica FirstÃ¢Â€Â initiative.Ã‚Â 

Other extremists have alleged that due to the U.S.Ã¢Â€Â™s focus on Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza, the military has been unable to adequately assist with needed disaster relief. On October 3, 2024, The Western Chauvinist, a white supremacist Proud Boys offshoot channel, posted on Telegram, Ã¢Â€ÂœThe occupied US government has sent all the young people in the military that could've helped to Israel. It isn't the government that has responded, but Nationalists like Patriot Front who answer the call.""

In early October, a white supremacist X/Twitter account, Ã¢Â€Âœ1488 Radio,Ã¢Â€Â hosted a pro-white Twitter space event with 10,300 listeners. During the stream, an individual who claimed to be a Hurricane survivor blamed the war in Gaza for inadequate emergency aid, ""Our state government and federal government are nowhere to be found...They [the military] are being stood up to go to goddamn Israel."" This Twitter spaceÃ¢Â€Â™s sound bites have since been shared across a range of white supremacist online accounts and channels.

White supremacist propaganda shared on Telegram quoting anti-Israel soundbites from the Ã¢Â€Âœ1488 RadioÃ¢Â€Â Twitter space, asserting that Ã¢Â€Âœno one is coming to saveÃ¢Â€Â victims of Hurricane Helene because of Israel. (Source: Gab/Screenshot)

Ã‚Â 

Extremist groups have also targeted FEMA employees and government officials who are Jewish or whom they believe to be Jewish with antisemitic harassment and vitriol. On October 8, Michael Weaver, a self-described Ã¢Â€ÂœspokespersonÃ¢Â€Â for the antisemitic Goyim Defense League (GDL)Ã‚Â posted a new flier for the network on Gab, which claims, Ã¢Â€ÂœEvery Single Aspect of FEMA is Jewish.Ã¢Â€Â A few days earlier, Leslie Boyanton, a live streamer with the antisemitic GDL, promoted an episode of his Ã¢Â€ÂœBen Tanklin ShowÃ¢Â€Â called Ã¢Â€ÂœFuck FEMA Friday,Ã¢Â€Â which was accompanied by the image of the FEMA Director of Public Affairs, Jacklyn Rothenberg, alongside an Israeli flag.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

Other extremists and prominent conspiracy theorists have used Hurricane Helene to elevate longstanding antisemitic tropes, including that Jews have outsized control or influence over the media and government. For example, Red Ice TV, a white supremacist website and video streaming platform, alleged in late September that Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraeli issuesÃ¢Â€Â are getting more mainstream media attention than Hurricane Helene. On October 4, 2024,Ã‚Â Andrew Torba, founder and CEO of alternative social media platform Gab, posted on X that Jewish government officials are using American tax dollars to fund Ã¢Â€ÂœIsraeli bombsÃ¢Â€Â instead of using them towards hurricane victim relief.

Stew Peters, a far-right conspiracy theorist and prolific antisemite, recently promoted the conspiracy theory that Jews are manipulating hurricanes to ""destroyÃ¢Â€Â the United States. In an October 9, 2024, segment of the Ã¢Â€ÂœStew Peters ShowÃ¢Â€Â on Hurricane Helene, Peters claimed that the Jewish community has advanced Ã¢Â€ÂœtechnologyÃ¢Â€Â to Ã¢Â€Âœweaponize weatherÃ¢Â€Â and is extending their Ã¢Â€Âœoctopus tentaclesÃ¢Â€Â into American society, broadcasting aÃ‚Â cartoon from the late 1800s that reflects the classic antisemitic tropeÃ‚Â portraying Jews as tentacled monsters.Ã‚Â 

Anti-Israel and antisemitic narratives surrounding Helene and Milton are also rife in anti-Zionist spaces, where posters claim that the U.S. government is withholding FEMA relief in favor of providing arms and other aid to Israel.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/united-nations-relief-and-works-agency-palestinian-refugees-unrwa,"Background:

For decades, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has been criticized for institutionalizing the Palestinian refugee crisis, the problematic anti-Israel and antisemitic content taught in its schools, the terrorist affiliations of some of its staff, and for its complicity with terrorist activities - including the use of its premises by terrorist groups. As a UN entity, UNRWA is obligated to uphold neutrality which includes ensuring that terrorists are neither employed by the agency, nor present on its premises.

Founded in 1949, UNWRA was established to provide relief and programs for Palestinian refugees after IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s 1948 War of Independence.Ã‚Â UNRWA classifies Palestinian refugees as those who left Israel in 1948; those who left the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967; those who were abroad but were subsequently not allowed to return to Israel; and all of their descendants. Refugee status is granted regardless of whether descendants have been resettled or obtained legal residency/nationality in another country. According to UNWRA, this totals five million Palestinian refugees, while the original estimated Palestinian refugee count was 750,000. UNRWAÃ¢Â€Â™s policy of including the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who left in 1948 and 1967 into the refugee population for demographic and aid purposes is unique among refugee populations, and is not a done for any other refugee group.

Israel believes the UNRWA statistics are exaggerated and further distinguishes Ã¢Â€ÂœrefugeesÃ¢Â€Â from Ã¢Â€Âœdisplaced personsÃ¢Â€Â and from Ã¢Â€Âœexpired permit PalestiniansÃ¢Â€Â who were abroad at the time the conflicts ensued and were not allowed to return.

UNRWA is the only UN body that works specifically with one refugee population Ã¢Â€Â“ Palestinians - while the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has a global mandate and works with every other refugee population. UNWRA is almost entirely funded by UN Member States with some funding coming from tax exempt foundations such as UNRWA USA National Committee, and the General Assembly has renewed its mandate every three years consecutively (most recently until June 30, 2026).

Around 30,000 people are employed by UNRWA around the Middle East, thousands of whom work in its schools. According to Israeli intelligence, before October 7thÃ‚Â  2023, over 450 active members of Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations were employed by UNRWA in Gaza. Additionally, in July 2024, evidence uncovered by the IDF found that at least 75 of the 510 employees in UNRWA's education system in the Gaza Strip who hold senior positions (school principals and their deputies, directors and deputy directors of training centers) are members of Hamas or the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Ã¢Â€Â The IDF provided details, including ID numbers, UNRWA schools of employment, organizational affiliations and positions, of 12 of such individuals to the public.

Involvement in the October 7 massacre:

Following the October 7, 2023 massacres in Israel perpetrated by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the IDF uncovered evidence that several UNRWA employees participated in the killing, kidnapping and brutalizing of civilians in Israel. A video of two UNRWA employees loading the body of Yonatan Samerano, a 21-year-old Israeli murdered on October 7, into a truck heading for Gaza was circulated widely online.

In January of 2024, Israeli authorities presented UNRWA with allegations that 19 of its employees based in Gaza had been involved in the October 7 attacks. Subsequently, Commissioner General of UNRWA Philippe Lazzarini stated that the contracts of implicated staff members were terminated and that an investigation was underway. In response to the allegations, several countries including the US and European Union paused or suspended funding to UNRWA.

Despite the IDF allegations, the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) investigationÃ‚Â  concluded that only 9 of the 19 implicated UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7thÃ‚Â  attack. UNRWA has maintained that the issue of neutrality breaches has been resolved through the investigation and is a case of Ã¢Â€Âœa few bad apples.Ã¢Â€Â

UNRWA facilities used as terror infrastructure:

Hamas and other terror organizations have long used UNRWA infrastructure across Gaza to house their military operations, including using them as a base of operation, to fire mortars at Israel and to provide access doors to terror tunnels underneath. As early as 2009, Hamas terrorists were found in UNRWA schools by the IDF. In 2014, there were multiple instances of terrorists firing from UNRWA schools, as well as rockets found stored in an UNRWA school.

Throughout its time in Gaza following October 7, the IDF found over thirty UNRWA facilities, including schools in Gaza containing terror infrastructure. On several occasions such facilities have been used to fire rockets at Israeli civilian areas. Beneath the UNRWA Headquarters in Gaza, the IDF discovered a Hamas subterranean data center which included computer rooms, servers, living quarters, and industrial power banks used to conduct Hamas terror activities.

Seized records from HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ Qassam Brigades (HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ military wing) show that to Hamas, schools and civilian facilities serve as Ã¢Â€Âœthe best obstacles to protect the resistance.Ã¢Â€Â

UNRWA Education and Terrorism:

For decades, there has been deep concern about anti-Israel and antisemitic content taught in UNRWA schools (at which 545,000 students are enrolled), both in the official curricular materials and in lessons by individual teachers. UNRWA claims to review all teaching materials taught in its schools to assure appropriate content and UNESCO standards, as well as to supplement host country materials. According to IMPACT-se, an organization that analyzes teaching materials around the world, in the Palestinian territories, UNESCO schools use the Palestinian Authority curriculum which, though revised in 2016, continues to contain antisemitic and Jihadist incitement content, sometimes more severe than previous iterations.

In 2021, IMPACT-se reviewed educational materials distributed during the COVID-19 pandemic for distance learning at UNRWA schools. Incitement to violence, hatred, and glorification of terrorism was found in the textbooks. For example, students were told to do mathematics problems using martyred terrorists from the First Intifada to calculate equations and told to Ã¢Â€Âœdefend the motherland with blood.Ã¢Â€Â Following the release of IMPACT-se's 2021 review, UNRWA Chief Lazzarini stated that the hateful materials were published by accident and replaced.

The November 2024 report by IMPACT-se details textbooks and teaching materials from five UNRWA schools run by senior Hamas leaders in Gaza, and again found glorification of terrorism, anti-Israel and antisemitic content in its educational materials.

Some educators at UNRWA schools have been discovered to be terrorists. Fateh al-Sharif, an UNRWA Principal and Teachers' Union leader, was confirmed by Hamas to be their commander in Lebanon after he was killed by an Israeli strike in September 2024. While principal of an UNRWA school, Al-Sharif repeatedly posted images of students dressed in Hamas uniforms and holding guns, as well as images of himself with Hamas members, pictured in images found by UN Watch on Al-Sharif's Facebook profile. Al-Sharif was repeatedly seen inviting other Hamas terror leaders to his UNRWA school. In March 2024, Fateh al-Sharif was suspended by UNRWA for breaches of neutrality which led to widespread protests and strikes at UNRWA schools for his reinstatement.

In several cases, after Israel provided evidence and warned that UNRWA educators were militants in terror organizations, they remained employed by the organization.

UNRWA Leadership Meet with Terrorists:

UN Watch discovered that in 2017, Pierre KrÃƒÂ¤henbÃƒÂ¼hl, Commissioner General of UNRWA at the time and current Director-General of the ICRC,Ã‚Â met with Hamas and PIJ leaders to discuss the Ã¢Â€Âœspirit of partnershipÃ¢Â€Â between the UN agency and the terrorist groups, telling them: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are united, no one can separate us.Ã¢Â€Â

According to findings by UN Watch, the practice of UNRWA chiefs meeting with terrorists has been ongoing, including with current UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini. He met with officials from the Palestinian Joint Action Committee, a coalition of Palestinian armed groups in Lebanon, in March 2021. During the meeting, which included a discussion of UNRWAÃ¢Â€Â™s cash assistance to refugees, Lazzarini spoke with Hajj Abu Suleiman Al-Saadi, an Asbat al-Ansar terrorist, and Sheikh of the Palestinian Jihadi Movement, Jamal Khattab, among others. The Palestinian Joint Action Committee is headed by leaders from each domestic branch of the armed groups including DFLP, Hamas, Palestinian Jihad, and Asbat al-Ansar.

Additionally, in 2004, then Commissioner General of UNRWA Peter Hansen was quoted saying ""I am sure there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll. And I don't see that as a crime,"" during an interview with CBC News.

Israeli Reactions to UNRWA Activities:

Israel has repeatedly shared with UNRWA leadership and the UN Secretary General its information on UNRWAÃ¢Â€Â™s entanglement with terrorists by way of official letters and complaints against the organization, to little effect.

On October 28, 2024, IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s parliament voted to ban UNRWA operations in Israel and significantly restrict its abilities to operate in Gaza and the West Bank, due to the links between UNRWA and terrorist organizations. The decision was highly controversial and drew condemnation from several governments who do not see an alternative to UNRWA for providing Palestinians aid and education. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuÃ¢Â€Â™s office, Israel will work with other aid organizations to ensure delivery of aid to Gazan civilians.

After passing the legislation, Israel briefed diplomats from countries that fund UNRWA on the documents of evidence it has compiled proving the organizationÃ¢Â€Â™s ties to terrorist factions. Gazan residents themselves have said in interviews that it is widely known that Hamas has operatives in UNRWA schools, as reported by the New York Times.

International Legal Reactions:

The mounting evidence against UNRWA for its severe breaches of neutrality and complicity with terrorism have led to international legal actions against the UN agency, as well as governmental suspension of funds.

In January 2024, the United States Congress froze funding for UNRWA until at least March 2025 following the allegations of staff membership in terror organizations, and in December 2024 Sweden completely halted funding for UNRWA for 2025 while nearly doubling its funding for other aid organizations. Also in December 2024, the Dutch Parliament voted to gradually phase out funding for the agency until 2029, when only 1 million Euros will be granted.

Several lawsuits have been filed against UNRWA by October 7th survivors and families of victims, one of which was filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan by about 100 Israeli plaintiffs alleging that UNWA Ã¢Â€Âœaided and abettedÃ¢Â€Â Hamas by providing $1 billion in aid to Gaza which was diverted to Hamas to support its terror activities and infrastructure.

UNRWA USA is being sued by the National Jewish Advocacy Center, Inc. (NJAC), on behalf of ten Plaintiffs in US federal court claiming that UNRWA USA aided and abetted terrorism through its monetary support of UNRWA. The Plaintiffs argue that UNRWA USA violated the Anti-Terrorism Act, as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, by aiding and abetting and knowingly providing support and resources to UNRWA and Hamas, who they claim jointly carry out terrorist activities.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/intimidation-harassment-and-support-hamas-mark-widespread-anti-israel-student,"On the grim anniversary of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7, 2023 terror massacre in southern Israel, when thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages, anti-Israel student group demonstrations on U.S. campuses again featured extreme pro-terror messages that glorified the attack and sought to disrupt campus life. Some events were marked by vandalism, intimidation and harassment.

On a day when Jewish people around the world were mourning the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, Jewish students and community members were repeatedly confronted with rhetoric that celebrated that violence on the ground and online.

The dayÃ¢Â€Â™s actions were part of a campus-focused Ã¢Â€ÂœWeek of RageÃ¢Â€Â endorsed by the national leadership of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and other prominent anti-Zionist groups ahead of the October 7 anniversary. MondayÃ¢Â€Â™s actions also followed widespread off-campus anniversary protests organized by many of those same groups during an Ã¢Â€ÂœInternational Day of ActionÃ¢Â€Â over the weekend of October 5Ã¢Â€Â“6, which was also characterized by significant support for terror.

Student groups on over 100 U.S. campuses sponsored activities on October 7, 2024. At many of these events, protestersÃ¢Â€Â™ signs, clothing, flags, chants and speaker comments explicitly venerated HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s deadly attack. For example, many referred to the terror assault using HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s name for it Ã¢Â€Â” the Ã¢Â€ÂœAl Aqsa FloodÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” or by characterizing it as a laudable act of liberation or Ã¢Â€Âœbreaking out of prison.Ã¢Â€Â Other examples included displaying paraglider imagery, a direct reference to HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s use of paragliders to invade southern Israeli communities on October 7, or inverted red triangle imagery, a symbol popularized by Hamas over the past year to mark targets.

At the University of Illinois Chicago, students walked out of classes at noon and gathered to Ã¢Â€Âœtake over the quadÃ¢Â€Â on campus. A speaker representing the Chicago chapter of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) read from a statement published by the group to celebrate the anniversary of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s attack: Ã¢Â€ÂœOn October 7, the sound of freedom thundered across Palestine, and its echoes are still being heard around the world. The Palestinian resistance launched Operation Al Aqsa Flood, a mass breakout from the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest open air prison, Gaza. And, in doing so, they took a historic step towards liberation.Ã¢Â€Â

In Philadelphia, anti-Israel protesters from throughout the region gathered at Drexel University for a protest that featured numerous extreme displays of support for terror. This included a banner carried by members of the local FRSO chapter that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœVictory to the Palestinian Resistance,Ã¢Â€Â alongside gun and paraglider imagery.

Protesters in Philadelphia also flew a flag bearing the logo of the U.S.-designated terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and a flag with an image of Abu Obaida, the spokesperson for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s military wing). Obaida and the Al-Qassam Brigades were also referenced in multiple chants at the protest that called for violence against Israel: Ã¢Â€ÂœAbu Obaida, love: strike, strike, Tel AvivÃ¢Â€Â (translated from Arabic) and Ã¢Â€ÂœAl-Qassam, make us proud; take another soldier now.Ã¢Â€Â

The Philadelphia protest was co-sponsored or endorsed by SJP chapters and other anti-Israel student groups from many local schools, including host Drexel University, Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, Swarthmore College, Temple University, the University of Pennsylvania and Villanova University. Corresponding chapters of Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine (FSJP) from those schools also endorsed the protest.

New York City also saw significant activity, with student groups holding protests at colleges throughout the city and later converging for a joint off-campus rally and march in conjunction with the pro-terror anti-Israel group, Within Our Lifetime (WOL). At Columbia University, protesters carried signs that included an image of Abu Obaida alongside the slogan Ã¢Â€ÂœZionismÃ¢Â€Â™s end daysÃ¢Â€Â and inverted red triangle imagery. Another sign depicted Obaida with the message Ã¢Â€ÂœLong Live the Al-Aqsa Flood; Glory to the ResistanceÃ¢Â€Â alongside paraglider and inverted red triangle imagery.

A speaker praised Ã¢Â€Âœthe heroic acts by the Palestinian Resistance and its allies in the regionÃ¢Â€Â and commented that Ã¢Â€ÂœPalestinian Resistance remains our guiding light.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Students also chanted, Ã¢Â€ÂœResistance is glorious, we will be victorious,Ã¢Â€Â effectively exalting HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s actions on October 7.

Ã‚Â 

Student protesters from more than a dozen New York-area schools merged with the off-campus WOL-led protest later in the afternoon that made its way through Lower and Midtown Manhattan. The large march drew thousands of participants and featured significant support for terror in the form of Hamas and Hezbollah flags, signs like the Samidoun-branded Ã¢Â€ÂœLong Live October 7thÃ¢Â€Â banner also seen at previous NYC protests, and more. Nerdeen Kiswani, a former student activist who leads WOL, shared support for October 7 during her speech and denied reports of Israeli suffering, including accounts from Israeli women who were raped by terrorists during the attack.

At Tulane University in New Orleans, LA, protesters carried signs with messages that included Ã¢Â€ÂœLong Live ResistanceÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â” in which the two Ls were represented with images of guns Ã¢Â€Â” alongside paraglider and inverted red triangle imagery. Slogans and imagery seen at the DePaul University student walkout in Chicago, IL, included a sign with an illustration of notorious PFLP terrorist Leila Khaled alongside the slogan Ã¢Â€ÂœBy any means necessary,Ã¢Â€Â as well as a banner with the message, Ã¢Â€ÂœIt didnÃ¢Â€Â™t start on October 7th.Ã¢Â€Â

Some protests escalated into the direct harassment of students and other campus community members. At the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, anti-Israel protesters gathered directly outside of the Minnesota Hillel building while Jewish community members were inside to mourn the October 7 attack; Hillels nationwide have increasingly been the target of anti-Israel protests and activism in the past year.

At Pomona College in California, anti-Israel student protesters from across the Claremont Colleges rallied after walking out of class and then stormed into the Carnegie Hall academic building on campus. The protestersÃ¢Â€Â™ actions disrupted classes taking place inside the building and forced students in those classrooms to climb out of windows to leave since they were blocking the doors.

The protesters occupied the building for several hours. While inside, they vandalized the building with graffiti that included the spray-painted messages, Ã¢Â€ÂœINTIFADAÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœFUCK POMONA.Ã¢Â€Â The action was reminiscent of the destructive escalation tactics employed by anti-Israel student groups on various campuses during the encampment movement in the spring semester of 2024. Later in the day, university officials reported Ã¢Â€Âœextensive damageÃ¢Â€Â in Carnegie Hall and announced that the building Ã¢Â€Âœwill remain closed until further notice, and classes will be relocated.Ã¢Â€Â

Instances of vandalism were reported on numerous other campuses on Monday. At Chapman University in Orange, CA, for example, images of burning Israeli flags were painted on the ground, along with the slogans Ã¢Â€ÂœF Israel,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath to IsraelÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath to America.Ã¢Â€Â The graffiti also featured a threatening message directed at the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s pro-Israel student group, Students Supporting Israel (SSI), with an inverted red triangle drawn over the text Ã¢Â€ÂœSSI.Ã¢Â€Â Vandalism incidents also took place Monday at Cal Poly Humboldt, City College of New York, Princeton University, the University of South Florida, the University of Virginia and other schools.

In addition to the on-the-ground activities of anti-Israel protesters on campuses throughout the day, on social media, many student groups also celebrated the anniversary of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7 attack and affirmed their support for terrorism more broadly. Posts from dozens of groups framed terrorism as praiseworthy Ã¢Â€ÂœresistanceÃ¢Â€Â and terrorists as heroic Ã¢Â€Âœfreedom fighters.Ã¢Â€Â Many posts featured photographs and related imagery taken directly from the October 7 attack.

Graphics celebrating HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7 attack, posted on social media alongside a longer statement by the Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity (SCDS) at Pennsylvania State University, demonstrated the type of pro-terror messages shared by many anti-Israel student groups to mark the October 7 anniversary.

Students Allied for Freedom and Equality (SAFE) at the University of Michigan, for example, published a statement across social media platforms that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe October 7th mobilization lives on as a historic act of resistance against the Zionist colonial project. We remain in complete, unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian people and their dignified resistance forces. Glory to our martyrs and power to our freedom fighters. May they continue to be victorious over their oppressors.Ã¢Â€Â

Georgia State University SJP posted: Ã¢Â€ÂœToday we extend our solidarity and unconditional support to the people of Palestine and Lebanon, their brave resistance fighters, and their martyrs.Ã¢Â€Â New Brunswick SJP, which remains active at Rutgers University despite the recent suspension of its status as an officially recognized student group due to campus policy violations, published a statement that opened by commemorating HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s attack: Ã¢Â€ÂœA year ago today, on October 7th, the Palestinian resistance launched the Al-Aqsa Flood offensive strategy to break out of the 17-year-long open-air prison of the blockaded Gaza Strip.Ã¢Â€Â

Case Western Reserve University SJP and LSJP (Law Students for Justice in Palestine) wrote in a joint statement: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe only tragedy that October 7th commemorates is the start of another genocide against the Palestinian people.Ã¢Â€Â Swarthmore SJP posted, Ã¢Â€ÂœHappy October 7th!Ã¢Â€Â on Instagram and solicited donations for a fundraiser Ã¢Â€Âœin honor of this glorious day and all our martyred revolutionaries.Ã¢Â€Â

University of California, Davis SJP shared Hamas propaganda featuring Abu Obaida, while the University of California, Berkeley YDSA shared PFLP propaganda. The student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest posted a series of photographs celebrating violence against Israelis, including images from October 7 as well as the Ramallah lynching of two Israeli military reservists in 2000 during the Second Intifada.

* NOTE: THIS ARTICLE ORIGINALLY APPEARED IN THE TIMES OF ISRAEL.

Ã‚Â 

There are no Starbucks in Israel.

Yet, over the past year since the horrific attacks of October 7th in which Hamas terrorists butchered 1,200 innocent men, women, and children, Starbucks locations all over the US Ã¢Â€Â” and the world Ã¢Â€Â” have been vandalized with anti-Israel graffiti. Calls to boycott Starbucks have been spray-painted on stores and spread online. The situation grew so serious that the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s CEO addressed the situation in the company end-of-year letter to shareholders.

Ironically, Starbucks does have locations in Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and throughout the Persian Gulf, serving exponentially more Muslims than Jews.

In light of all the death and destruction these past 365 days and the 101 hostages still held in captivity in Gaza, the plight of a multinational, billion-dollar coffee chain might seem trivial.

Yet what happened to Starbucks is emblematic of the stakes of the conflict the Jewish community has found itself in since 10/7. Antisemitism has erupted across the US and globally. While some may see this strictly as a problem for the Jewish community, that is willfully myopic. Antisemitism is not just the oldest hatred, but a symptom of deep dysfunction below the surface of liberal democratic societies and a threat to the pluralism that makes these countries work.

In the years leading up to 10/7, antisemitism already had reached record heights. Since then, it has exploded. Antisemitic incidents increased 140 percent from 2022 to 2023, breaking all previous records. According to the most recent FBI hate crimes report, anti-Jewish hate crimes rose 63 percent to 1,832 incidents in 2023, the highest number ever recorded since the Bureau began collecting data in 1991.

Driving this surge is a concomitant increase in antisemitic attitudes. For nearly 30 years, ADL found that the percentage of Americans with intense antisemitic attitudes hovered at around 10 percent. In 2022, that jumped to 20 percent. And in 2024, it jumped to 24 percent Ã¢Â€Â” the highest level ADL has seen in six decades.

Surging antisemitism impacts Jewish Americans in many ways: the armed guards protecting every synagogue in America; the observant Jew who makes sure to cover his kippah with a baseball cap when out in public; the college student who hides her connection to the Jewish homeland in order to join a club or just get through the day without being harassed; the Jewish professionals Ã¢Â€Â“ authors, investors, therapists, small business owners Ã¢Â€Â” targeted as Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistsÃ¢Â€Â and subsequently bullied by activists, shunned by confused clients and ignored by terrified customers.

But the broader world canÃ¢Â€Â™t afford the pipe dream that this disease can be contained. While the Jewish community certainly bears the brunt of antisemitism, it is a contagion. It ultimately will infect Ã¢Â€Â” and endanger Ã¢Â€Â“ all of American society.

There are many reasons for its unprecedented spread. Despite rising standards of living, tectonic changes in the economy and society have generated widespread anxiety and massive uncertainty. Social media has played a part by reinforcing the sense that there is no empirical truth and any outlandish plot is possible. All of this creates a ripe environment for conspiracy thinking and scapegoating on all sides.

On the extreme right, this most prominently has taken the form of the Ã¢Â€ÂœGreat ReplacementÃ¢Â€Â theory, a conspiracy that posits that a cabal of Jews is opening the borders of the United States to let in non-white minorities to replace Ã¢Â€Âœreal Americans.Ã¢Â€Â This is why the tiki-torch marchers at Charlottesville in 2017 chanted Ã¢Â€ÂœJews will not replace us.Ã¢Â€Â This is how the gunman who gunned down 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018 justified the massacre. And this is what is spouted with increasing frequency by far-right personalities such as Nick Fuentes, Candace Owens, and Tucker Carlson.

For this group, toxic antisemitism is core to their ideology. As political theorist Eric Ward has written, their virulent white nationalism and its anti-immigrant, anti-Black, and anti-Muslim views emanate from their conspiratorial hatred of Jews.

Radicals on the left start with a very different set of coordinates but somehow manage to land at the same destination. This doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t mean that every protestor who has taken to the streets since 10/7 is motivated by hate. Many are inspired by genuine concern regarding the civilian death toll in Gaza.

Nonetheless, it is increasingly clear that the dominant current propelling many of these protests is not enlightened universalism, but raw desire to eliminate the only Jewish country in the entire world Ã¢Â€Â“ home to nearly half of the Jews worldwide. It is a radical ideology focused, not on ending the conflict or even achieving peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, but simply on destroying the Jewish state.

As this single-minded obsession with exterminating Israel has taken hold among the ranks of the activists, there has been an unmistakable embrace of conspiratorial views Ã¢Â€Â“ for example, that Jews are part of an Ã¢Â€ÂœoppressorÃ¢Â€Â class responsible for the ills of the Middle East and of the United States and that Jews have undue amounts of power over universities and of the government. Like those on the right, such a worldview is impervious to facts and often leads to anarchic violence and rage against Jews, Israel, and increasingly America itself.

Numerous examples illustrate this point. To name a few, last May, activists broke into the PresidentÃ¢Â€Â™s office at Stanford and poured red paint on his desk. At the same time, others defaced the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s Main Quad with messages like Ã¢Â€ÂœDe@th 2 Isr@hell,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœPigs taste best dead,Ã¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœF*** Amerikkka.Ã¢Â€Â

When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington DC this past summer to deliver remarks before Congress, activists agitated across the city. In front of historic Union Station, they vandalized statues with phrases like Ã¢Â€ÂœHamas is coming!Ã¢Â€Â Others burned Israeli and American flags.

This past September at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, protesters entered the historic Navy ROTC building, replaced the American flag with a Palestinian one, and spray painted the outside with Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath to the USÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœBurn it all.Ã¢Â€Â

And so, this is why protesters target Starbucks. Not only is its founder, Howard Schultz, a prominent Jewish businessman, but the coffee giant also is among the most prominent American brands. It is a veritable symbol of capitalism itself.

Neither of these worldviews make sense, but both erode the very fabric of our country. You canÃ¢Â€Â™t have a reasoned argument with people who ignore history and facts. You canÃ¢Â€Â™t have the compromises necessary to make a multi-ethnic democracy work if people see some of their neighbors as the embodiment of evil. You canÃ¢Â€Â™t resolve conflicts peacefully if some believe that the stakes are literally life as you know it.

And yet, this is not surprising. As we have seen throughout history, no democracy with a severe antisemitism problem stays a democracy for long. As the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote, the hate that starts with the Jews never ends there. Antisemitism is an insatiable monster that consumes everything.

This is why the surge of anti-Jewish hate in America over this past year should be so troubling for all Americans regardless of where they pray or how they identify. This antipathy toward the Jewish community is setting the stage for a far larger fight in this country. Some might even call it a Ã¢Â€Âœbattle for the soul of America.Ã¢Â€Â

One day, the hostages will come home, the current conflict will subside, and perhaps there will be peace for both people: safety and security for Israelis and dignity and equality for Palestinians. IÃ¢Â€Â™m deeply committed to working towards this future.

But if we fail to stamp out the evil of antisemitism currently taking root on both sides of the political spectrum, it will fracture the very foundation of our country. And, if history is any indication, once that base is damaged, there is no guarantee that we will be able to fix it. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s up to us to halt this trend before itÃ¢Â€Â™s too late.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH

OnÃ‚Â the evening ofÃ‚Â October 6th, 2023,Ã‚Â my extended family gathered at my parents' homeÃ‚Â to mark theÃ‚Â 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.

As we listened to themÃ‚Â recall the surprise and shock of that day, and the personal and national responses to theÃ‚Â war, I was reminded of how thatÃ‚Â conflict, whose leadup became known as ""the mother of all intelligence failures"",Ã‚Â led Israel on a path of new strategic thinkingÃ‚Â which included adopting a devilÃ¢Â€Â™s advocate approach when evaluating any course of military action.Ã‚Â 

We had no idea how soon thisÃ‚Â notion would be tested.Ã‚Â 

Hours later, at 6:29 on Shabbat morning, the earth shook.Ã‚Â 

I was on my regular Saturday morning run when my phoneÃ‚Â lit upÃ‚Â with red alert notifications. Immediately after,Ã‚Â explosions echoed around me with large parts of IsraelÃ‚Â under missile attack. What we didn't know thenÃ‚Â wasÃ‚Â that these projectilesÃ‚Â were just a diversion tactic, setting the stage for a land invasion by Hamas from Gaza into Israeli kibbutzim, towns, and even a music festival,Ã‚Â to carry out the most horrific and deadlyÃ‚Â attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.Ã‚Â 

October 7th changed my perception of human evil.Ã‚Â I never deluded myselfÃ‚Â thinking it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t exist, but the scale of the attack, the unimaginable cruelty, and the terrifying outcomes of that dayÃ‚Â led me to understand howÃ‚Â members of a society indoctrinated to hate others canÃ‚Â resort to inhumane barbarism.Ã‚Â It was in that moment that I took on the mission to do everything possible to completely uproot such a dangerousÃ‚Â way ofÃ‚Â thinking.

In the days following October 7th,our minds were flooded withÃ‚Â a spectrum of thoughts, feelings and questions Ã¢Â€Â“ aboutÃ‚Â our shattered sense of security,Ã‚Â the impact on Israeli society as a whole - including on non-Jewish minoritiesÃ‚Â who were directly affected -the other fronts Israel is facingÃ‚Â and theÃ‚Â fate ofÃ‚Â over 140,000 Internally displaced Israelis.Ã‚Â It soon became clear that above all else, two subjects would dominate our thinking from that point forward: the savage cruelty of the massacre and theÃ‚Â fate of theÃ‚Â hostages.Ã‚Â 

As with every Israeli, I had people around me affected by the massacre.Ã‚Â 

My sister-in-law's familyÃ‚Â was slaughtered in Kibbutz BeÃ¢Â€Â™eri. Only two of theÃ‚Â sixÃ‚Â Even family members survived: Tomer (12) and Nir (8). Their parents, Chen and Rinat, and their brothers, Alon (16) and Ido (14) Ã¢Â€Â“ may their memories be a blessing -Ã‚Â were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists while shieldingÃ‚Â the two young brothersÃ‚Â with their own bodiesÃ‚Â to protect them.

My daughterÃ¢Â€Â™s friend Cpl.Ã‚Â Noa Marciano,Ã‚Â was kidnapped to Gaza from her IDF base and was murdered in captivity a little over than a month later.Ã‚Â Her body wasÃ‚Â later recovered by theÃ‚Â IDF and buried in Israel.Ã‚Â 

The list it goes on and on Ã¢Â€Â“ endless stories of heartbreak and horror, an emotional rollercoaster that never stops.Ã‚Â AÃ‚Â heavy weight has been sitting on ourÃ‚Â hearts, not just for a moment,Ã‚Â butÃ‚Â throughout theÃ‚Â entire year.Ã‚Â 

Yet,Ã‚Â amidstÃ‚Â this hardship, weÃ‚Â witnessed moving solidarity, unimaginable heroism from citizens and security personnel, and incredible resilience.Ã‚Â InÃ‚Â the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s darkest hour, the Israeli spiritÃ‚Â hasÃ‚Â shone brightly Ã¢Â€Â“Ã‚Â helping bridgedisagreements and enabling Israeli society to stand united against all challenges.Ã‚Â 

AndÃ‚Â alongside this Israeli spirit stood the unwavering support of Diaspora Jewry.Ã‚Â 

Communities and organizations that in normal times have differing views on a variety of subjects stoodÃ‚Â unified in support of Israel,Ã‚Â loudly calling for and working towards the release of the hostages. TheseÃ‚Â Jewish communities stood firmly with Israel, while confronting a tsunami of antisemitism and anti-IsraelÃ‚Â hate.Ã‚Â This all led me to my second mission: ensuring Israeli society does not forget this moment in Jewish history, when we all stood togetherÃ‚Â In unity with Israel and the hostages, and against the rise of antisemitism and anti-Israel hate.

Of all the post-October 7 issues, the hostage situation is the most excruciating. This occupies my thoughts more than anything Ã¢Â€Â“ the beautiful faces of the kidnapped children, women and men, are seen across the country and the world. My waking hours are spent thinking aboutÃ‚Â what more can we do to bring them home.

Reaching a deal must take precedence over everything else. WhileÃ‚Â  IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s security challenges will certainly remain for many years, a nation cannot allow its sons and daughters to remain in cruel captivity. ""PidyonÃ‚Â ShivuyimÃ¢Â€Â - freeing captives - is one of highest values in JudaismÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ and this is what guides me. I know this will be hard and may require difficult steps on IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s part, but what other choice do we have? As long asÃ‚Â the hostages are not returned home, Israeli society cannot fully heal from the wounds of Oct. 7 and work towards rebuilding.Ã‚Â 

And that is what I believe is the task before us. WeÃ‚Â mustÃ‚Â do all we can to push for the release of the hostages. We must also work to fortify the bonds of Jewish peoplehood linking us across the world, while simultaneously strengthening the IsraeliÃ‚Â values of family, community, respect and tolerance,Ã‚Â andÃ‚Â rejecting those who seek to divide us through hate andÃ‚Â extremism. Only then will we, as individuals and as a society, be able to lift up our heads and rebuild from this terrible tragedy.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/anti-israel-protesters-celebrate-one-year-anniversary-hamass-october-7-attacks,"On Saturday, October 5, 2024, anti-Israel protesters around the world held an Ã¢Â€ÂœInternational Day of ActionÃ¢Â€Â to kick off a multi-day celebration of the anniversary of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Across more than 80 U.S. cities, protesters gathered for demonstrations that were largely characterized by explicit support for terror, including the October 7 attack itself. The weekendÃ¢Â€Â™s protest activity reflected the larger trends that emerged in the anti-Israel movement over the past year.Ã‚Â 

The October 5 Ã¢Â€ÂœInternational Day of ActionÃ¢Â€Â was just the start of a scheduled week of anti-Israel events centered around the one-year commemoration of the October attacks. Protests continued Sunday, October 6 in a number of additional cities. Beginning on Monday, October 7, National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is organizing a Ã¢Â€ÂœWeek of RageÃ¢Â€Â related to the anniversary, with dozens of chapters nationwide slated to participate with walkouts and other events on college campuses.

Ã¢Â€ÂœInternational Day of ActionÃ¢Â€Â organizers included the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP), U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN) and ANSWER Coalition, among others.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

Organizers shared an online announcement of the protests on August 24, with the slogan, Ã¢Â€ÂœOne Year of Genocide, One Year of ResistanceÃ¢Â€Â and a photograph of a Palestinian man standing atop an Israeli military vehicle, taken after Hamas broke through the border fence on October 7. Similar messaging, much of which included imagery celebrating theOctober 7 attacks and phrases like Ã¢Â€ÂœGaza Resists; Gaza Remains,Ã¢Â€Â featured prominently on banners and signs carried by protesters nationwide during the day of action.Ã‚Â 

At the October 5 and 6 protests, praise for terrorists and terrorism was front and center Ã¢Â€Â”Ã‚Â  on the materials displayed by protesters and in spoken remarks. Speakers and attendees lauded Hamas and other U.S.-designated terrorist groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis (Ansar Allah) in Yemen for their attacks against Israel over the past year.
Ã‚Â 

New York City hosted one of the largest protests of the day, where Manolo De Los Santos Ã¢Â€Â”Executive Director of the NY-based PeopleÃ¢Â€Â™s Forum, one of the Ã¢Â€ÂœInternational Day of ActionÃ¢Â€Â co-sponsors Ã¢Â€Â” praised the so-called Ã¢Â€ÂœResistance,Ã¢Â€Â apparently alluding to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and other terror groups in the region by referring to the Ã¢Â€Âœresistance,Ã¢Â€Â which has been a frequent rhetorical stand-in for terror groups among post-October 7 activists. He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe salute the glorious Resistance Ã¢Â€Â” of the people of Yemen, of the people of Iraq, of the people of Iran, of the people of Lebanon, of the people of Gaza. All the people of the Arab world are teaching us a lesson. The only way to live with dignity is to fight, is to resist, is to never give up.Ã¢Â€Â
Ã‚Â 

Santos further reflected on the anti-Israel protests that his group and others organized in the days immediately after HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7 attack in 2023, doubling down nearly a year later by again characterizing HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7 attack as an admirable act of liberation rather than a violent act of terrorism.

Santos told the crowd: Ã¢Â€ÂœDespite all these corrupt politicians trying to scare us, trying to demonize us, we came out into the streets. One year ago, we were right here doing the impossible, doing what no one thought was the right thing. But history has proven us right. On October 7, the Palestinian people broke out of a concentration camp. But they broke out not only for their own freedom, they broke out to wake up the world. They delivered a burning message to all our hearts and all our minds: The world has to rise up to fight back against U.S. imperialism.Ã¢Â€Â
Ã‚Â 

Speakers nationwide shared similar rhetoric. In Gainesville, FL, a protest leader with the local Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) chapter praised Hamas and Hezbollah, drawing cheers of support from the crowd. He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Resistance is stronger than itÃ¢Â€Â™s ever been. And we have seen that this weekÃ¢Â€Â¦[The] resilience of the Iranian forces. We have seen the strength of Hezbollah and the Lebanese ResistanceÃ¢Â€Â¦The strength, the power, the sumud [steadfastness] of the Palestinian Resistance in Gaza and the West BankÃ¢Â€Â¦ Ã¢Â€Â˜Until victoryÃ¢Â€Â™ Ã¢Â€Â” that is the motto. Until victory!Ã¢Â€Â
Ã‚Â 

In Detroit, MI, Yemeni Liberation Movement (YLM) representative Monica Isaac spoke of Ã¢Â€Âœthe Al-Aqsa Flood,Ã¢Â€Â using HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s name for the October 7 attack, and the Ã¢Â€ÂœAxis of Resistance,Ã¢Â€Â a term which refers to Iran and its proxies of terrorist organizations in the Middle East. Isaac said, Ã¢Â€ÂœRevolution is not an aesthetic, it is an ugly, arduous and dedicated process.Ã¢Â€Â She praised Ã¢Â€Âœthe determination of steel the Yemini Resistance embodiesÃ¢Â€Â and how Ã¢Â€Âœthey are unmoved by the Zionist entity.Ã¢Â€Â
Ã‚Â 

In Chicago, IL, a speaker said, Ã¢Â€ÂœThis year has been defined in the teachings of the Resistance, who broke through the wall, confirming for us that liberation by any means necessary is entirely inevitable. Who confirmed for us that Zionism in its most robust and dominant form will always beÃ¢Â€Â¦easily devastated.Ã¢Â€Â The speaker concluded by expressing her desire for the Ã¢Â€Âœdestruction of the Zionist state and those who support it.Ã¢Â€Â
Ã‚Â 

Protesters also joined in celebrating terrorist groups; rally-goers in at least ten states displayed signs, flags, headbands or other paraphernalia that featured either the logos of U.S.-designated terrorist groups Ã¢Â€Â” including Hamas and Hezbollah as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) Ã¢Â€Â” or pictures of individuals affiliated with those terrorist groups.Ã‚Â

In Washington, D.C., for example, one protester carried a Hamas flag while another held a sign with the caption, Ã¢Â€ÂœKilling our leaders only makes us stronger,Ã¢Â€Â alongside photographs of the recently killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and the recently killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. In San Diego, CA, a protester carried a sign that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœOctober 7 was a prison break from Gaza concentration campÃ¢Â€Â alongside inverted red triangle imagery.
Ã‚Â 

At the protests in New York, Los Angeles, and other cities, Writers Against the War on Gaza (WAWOG) members distributed the latest edition of their Ã¢Â€ÂœNew York War CrimesÃ¢Â€Â publication, which they launched a year ago to mock the New York Times and to convey their own anti-Israel, pro-terror slant. This newest edition featured the headline Ã¢Â€ÂœONE YEAR SINCE AL-AQSA FLOOD: REVOLUTION UNTIL VICTORY!Ã¢Â€Â Protest organizers including NSJP and PYM promoted the publication on social media.
Ã‚Â 

October 5 protesters carried signs celebrating Abu Obaida, spokesperson for HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s military wing, and Leila Khaled, a longtime PFLP leader known for hijacking of two civilian airliners, both of whom have been regularly glorified by anti-Israel protesters over the past year.
Ã‚Â 

Now-familiar chants also celebrated terrorism, including the refrains Ã¢Â€ÂœYemen, Yemen, make us proud; Turn another ship aroundÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœGaza called, Yemen answered, all Israeli ships are canceled,Ã¢Â€Â alluding to Houthi attacks on Israeli ships.Ã‚Â

Some protesters elevated antisemitic tropes, including equating Israel and Zionism with Nazism and the idea that Israel is somehow to blame for American domestic issues, demonstrated as support for the disproved conspiracy theory that U.S. financial support for Israel has led to slow relief response in U.S. regions devastated by Hurricane Helene.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Today is 10/7. This date has become an eternal shorthand for devastating loss and a deep well of resolve. It is also a sharp line drawn in our collective memory.

On October 6 -- the day before the horrific massacre by Hamas -- Israel, its friends and allies, and Jewish people across the world had no idea that we were about to be shaken and tested beyond our comprehension.

And then there was October 8, the day after our world was turned upside down. We were suddenly in a different world where an act of horrible savagery by Hamas had taken 1,200 lives in what felt like an instant, and over 250 people were taken hostage. Over one hundred remain in this cruel captivity.

Like some of you, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been to Israel since the attacks. I have seen destroyed homes with bullet holes pockmarking the walls and dried blood on the floors. I went to the site of the Nova festival where innocent young people were hunted down and slaughtered -- or kidnapped to Gaza. And I've met with many of the families of those kidnapped, listening and seeing their pain and anguish, but also their resolve to do everything to bring their loved ones back home.

The attacks by Hamas, by Hezbollah and the Houthis and the direct onslaught by the largest patron of antisemitic terrorism, Iran, have sparked a fire here in the U.S. and throughout the world. While antisemitic incidents had already been on the rise, these attacks threw fuel onto the fire. We saw the impact almost immediately. Online. In the streets. On our campuses.

There have been over ten thousand antisemitic incidents in the year since 10/7. Ten thousand. This is by far the highest number of incidents in the U.S. that ADL has ever recorded. Antisemitic bomb threats against synagogues. Assaults against Jewish students on campus. Harassment online and in once-quiet communities. Similarly angry and dangerous incidents have been taking place around the globe at the same time.

I could go on with statistic after statistic, chilling case after chilling case. But hereÃ¢Â€Â™s the thing. With you and the rest of my friends in the ADL community, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t have to.

Because every single one of you knows this story, and so many of you have been touched Ã¢Â€Â“ whether by something that happened directly to you, to your children, to your loved ones or to those who are part of our extended community.

Today we mourn 10/7. May the memories of those slain that day be a blessing and may we all keep their goodness alive in our hearts. And for those still in captivity, may they be protected from harm and come home soon to your families.

Tomorrow, we start another year of the 10/8 world. And this is our challenge:

To fight for our brothers and sisters on the frontlines in Israel

To never stop shouting for the release of our hostages

To demonstrate compassion for innocent lives irrespective of their ethnicity or faith

To speak out against antisemitism, wherever it comes from.

And when we in the ADL community are testedÃ¢Â€Â¦ to respond with resolve, compassion and intent to make the world a better place.

Am Yisrael Chai. The people of Israel live.","[1, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

This is the highest number of incidents ever recorded in any single year periodÃ‚Â since ADL started tracking in 1979.

These newly released figures, from Oct. 7, 2023 to Sept. 24, 2024,Ã‚Â represent an over 200-percent increase compared to the incidents reported to us during the same period a year before, which saw 3,325 incidents.

Ã¢Â€ÂœToday, we mourn the victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel, marking one year since the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. From that day on, Jewish Americans havenÃ¢Â€Â™t had a single moment of respite,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœInstead, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.Ã¢Â€Â

According to the ADL Center on Extremism, which gathers reports and tracks antisemitic incident data, these more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents break down into the following categories:

Ã‚Â·Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Over 8,015 incidents of verbal or written harassment.

Ã‚Â·Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Over 1,840 incidents of vandalism.

Ã‚Â·Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Over 150 incidents of physical assault.

Moreover, at least 1,200 of these antisemitic incidents happened on college campuses. In the same period a year before, ADL recorded about 200 incidents, representing a 500-percent increase.

Of these incidents, over 2,000 occurred at Jewish institutions such as synagogues and Jewish centers. More than half of all incidents at Jewish institutions took the form of bomb threats (only 81 bomb threats against Jewish institutions were recorded in the same period in the prior year.)

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s preliminary data also found that over 3,000 of all incidents took place during anti-Israel rallies, which featured regular explicit expressions of support for terrorist groups including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), one of the most concerningÃ‚Â antisemitic trends ADL captured since Oct. 7, 2023.

Each year, ADL tracks incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault in the United States. This data is published annually in theÃ‚Â Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. In 2023, ADL recorded an unprecedented total number of 8,873 antisemitic incidents, a 140-percent increase from the previous year.

ADL expects these preliminary figures to increase as it receives more incident reports from partners, law enforcement and victims. Final antisemitic incident data for 2024 will be published in the spring of 2025.

We are leaders of seven of the largest Jewish communities outside of Israel. One year ago, our communities were shocked and devasted by the horrifying terror attack on Israel.Ã‚Â  Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups massacred more than 1200 innocent people, young and old, who were burned, shot, tortured and raped in their homes, at a music festival, on a morning walk, or trying to flee their attackers.Ã‚Â  October 7 was the single deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

One year ago, over 250 people were ripped from their families, homes and friends and taken into Gaza as hostages.Ã‚Â  These hostages represent over two dozen nationalities, including citizens of our own countries, and include Jews, Christians, Muslims, Druze, Buddhists, Hindus and atheists. According to Hamas, their crime was being in a Jewish state. Today, 366 days later, 101 hostages remain in Gaza, their fate and condition still unknown.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

On this tragic anniversary, we also mark one year of unbridled, unprecedented antisemitism, that has targeted Jews around the globe. Our community organizations and governments have documented a staggering increase of antisemitic incidents since October 7. Jewish individuals and institutions have suffered violent attacks, arson, graffiti, harassment, and discrimination, hostility and isolation.Ã‚Â  We have been victimized in our homes, in the streets, on campuses, and online.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

One year later, we remain united in our call on our seven governments and on the international community:Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

To exercise maximum pressure on Hamas to immediately release all hostages still being held in Gaza.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
To support Israel as it remains under constant attack from Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, and their state sponsor, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and others who seek its eradication.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
To take concrete steps to fight antisemitism through legal, educational and whole-of-society strategies.Ã‚Â  The Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism, released in Buenos Aires in July 2024 and endorsed by over 40 countries and regional groupings, provide guidance for policies and actions that can be implemented by national governments, international organizations and civil societies alike.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

On this tragic anniversary, we continue to mourn those we have lost and to face significant challenges ahead for Israel and the Jewish people. Yet, we reaffirm the resilience and vibrancy of the global Jewish community. We stand ready to continue to collaborate with our partners in government and civil society to ensure a future of security and well-being for all.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/hind-rajab-foundation-and-dyab-abou-jahjah,"Background on HRF:

The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) was formed in Belgium in September 2024 by Lebanese-Belgian activists Dyab Abou Jahjah and Karim Hassoun. The organization is named after 6-year-old Hind Rajab, who was killed in Gaza in February 2024 allegedly by Israel, though an initial Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) probe found there were no troops in the area at the time.

In an article in The Nation, in December 2024, Abou Jahjah claimed the mission of the HRF is Ã¢Â€Âœto make sure that the soldiers who murdered Hind meet justiceÃ¢Â€Â”alongside their leaders and every other IDF murderer.Ã¢Â€Â

The HRF focuses on doxxing and launching legal cases against Israelis who have served in the IDF (military service is mandatory in Israel), and has to date submitted legal cases and petitions in eight countries against 28 individuals for alleged Ã¢Â€Âœwar crimes.Ã¢Â€Â On October 12, 2024, the HRF announced that it had submitted complaints to the International Criminal Court (ICC) against 1,000 Israeli soldiers. The organization has encouraged countries involved in the ICC case against Israel to issue arrest warrants against those it named.

Following the November 2024 pogromÃ‚Â  in Amsterdam against visiting Israeli soccer fans, HRF filed a complaint against the Israeli fans, claiming Ã¢Â€Âœincitement to hatred,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Âœgenocidal rhetoric,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Âœhate speech,Ã¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœproperty destruction.Ã¢Â€Â

While presenting himself as a civil rights activist, Dyab Abou Jahjah joined and received military training from Hezbollah before moving to Belgium, has repeatedly venerated Hezbollah and its late leader Hassan Nasrallah on social media, justified the October 7 massacre, denying that Hamas committed any rapes or ""systematic slaughter"" and has argued it is not antisemitic to say ""effing Jews.""

Who is Dyab Abou Jahjah?Ã‚Â 

Dyab Abou Jahjah was born in Lebanon, where he joined Hezbollah, and Ã¢Â€Âœhad military trainingÃ¢Â€Â, something he is Ã¢Â€Âœproud of.Ã¢Â€Â In 1991, he moved to Belgium.Ã‚Â 

In 2000, he co-founded the Arab European League (AEL) with Karim Hassoun, (pictured below at a mock funeral for Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, held outside the Kazerne DossinÃ‚Â memorial and museum in Belgium, which marks the sight of a Nazi transit camp used for transporting Jews and Romani people to Auschwitz-Birkenau).



Ã‚Â In 2002, Abou Jahjah was arrested in Antwerp, Belgium for inciting riots and resisting arrest. In 2004, SalonÃ‚Â reported that another of the co-founders of the AEL, Ahmed Azzouz, had Ã¢Â€ÂœthreatenedÃ¢Â€Â an Ã¢Â€Âœalmost unpreventableÃ¢Â€Â attack on AntwerpÃ¢Â€Â™s Jewish community if it did not Ã¢Â€Âœcancel its support for Jewish policy as fast as possible and distance itself from Israel.Ã¢Â€Â

Although Abou Jahjah claims to be a secular critic of Islamism, the 2004 Salon article quotes his desire for a Ã¢Â€ÂœsharocracyÃ¢Â€Â (a reference to Sharia Law) in Europe, in which Ã¢Â€Âœthe sale of alcoholÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœsexually suggestive advertisingÃ¢Â€Â would be banned.

Abou Jahjah is also on record as saying that 9/11 gave him a Ã¢Â€Âœsweet feeling of revenge.Ã¢Â€Â

In a January 2006 article on the AEL website, Abou Jahjah wrote that Europe had made Ã¢Â€Âœthe cult of the Holocaust and Jew-worshipingÃ¢Â€Â into an Ã¢Â€Âœalternative religion.Ã¢Â€Â

The same year, Abou Jahjah travelled to Lebanon, having indicated a desire to rejoin Hezbollah to fight Israel in the Second Lebanon War, sparking calls for the withdrawal of his Belgian passport for treason. In an interview with Vrij Nederland, Abou Jahjah stated that Ã¢Â€Âœin Lebanon [Ã¢Â€Â¦] I was close to the camp of Hezbollah and its allies. They have power and then doors open.Ã¢Â€Â

Upon returning to Belgium, he joined an Iranian regime-funded, Hezbollah-linked group called the International Union of Parliamentarians for Palestine (IUPFP).

Also in 2006, the AEL published a series of antisemitic and Holocaust-denying cartoons in The Netherlands, claiming that this was in response to the Danish Cartoon controversy earlier that year. One AEL cartoon portrayed Hitler in bed with Anne Frank, with the caption Ã¢Â€Âœwrite this one in your diary Anne!Ã¢Â€Â Another cartoon portrayed two men standing over a pile of skeletons, with one saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœI donÃ¢Â€Â™t think theyÃ¢Â€Â™re JewsÃ¢Â€Â and the other replying Ã¢Â€Âœwe have to get to the 6000000 somehow!Ã¢Â€Â




Claiming to go after Ã¢Â€Âœthe WestÃ¢Â€Â™s own Ã¢Â€Â˜sacred cowsÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â, Abou Jahjah wrote, Ã¢Â€ÂœI call upon every free sole [sic] among Arabs to use the Danish flag as a substitute for toilet paper. To illustrate every wall with graffiti making fun of everything Europe holds as holy: dancing rabbis on the carcasses of Palestinian children, hoax gas-chambers built in Hollywood in 1946 with Steven SpielbergÃ¢Â€Â™s approval stamp, and Aids spreading fagots (sic).""

On October 18, 2023, Abou Jahjah stated in a Facebook post. Ã¢Â€ÂœI cannot bear to hear what they call the Hebrew language. Its sound grates on my ears like a discordant noise [Ã¢Â€Â¦] It is an artificial monstrosity, a Frankenstein of a language, hideous in its essence, just like that illegitimate state whose official language it claims to be.Ã¢Â€Â




Despite claiming to differentiate between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, Abou Jahjah has nevertheless defended the singling out of Jews, and compared Jews to Germans during World War II, saying Ã¢Â€ÂœNot everyone saying, Ã¢Â€Â˜effing JewsÃ¢Â€Â™ is antisemitic [Ã¢Â€Â¦] When, in their anger at the injustice committed by the Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish State,Ã¢Â€Â such a person says, Ã¢Â€ÂœEffing Jews,Ã¢Â€Â it is not necessarily antisemitic. It is like when people said, Ã¢Â€ÂœEffing GermansÃ¢Â€Â in 1943; they did not necessarily hate Germans.Ã¢Â€Â

In 2009, Abou Jahjah signed an open letter demanding the Ã¢Â€Âœunconditional removal of Hamas and all other Palestinian liberation organizations from the European list of proscribed terrorist organizations.Ã¢Â€Â

Support for October 7:

On October 7, 2023, Abou Jahjah justified HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ attacks on Israeli kibbutzim as they were unfolding, calling the communities Ã¢Â€ÂœsettlementsÃ¢Â€Â and claiming that the Hamas militias were returning Ã¢Â€Âœrefugees.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 


Well after the nature of the October 7 attack became clear, Abu Jahjah continued to justify and support it, saying Ã¢Â€Âœanyone calling October 7 Ã¢Â€Â˜a pogromÃ¢Â€Â™ or an antisemitic attack is playing into Israeli propaganda [Ã¢Â€Â¦]Ã¢Â€Â

He has also tried to diminish and excuse the October 7 attack, saying that it involved Ã¢Â€Âœno planned or systematic slaughterÃ¢Â€Â, that Ã¢Â€Âœthe orders to Hamas fighters was not to attack civiliansÃ¢Â€Â and that Ã¢Â€Âœno babies were deliberately killed [Ã¢Â€Â¦] Nor were any women rapedÃ¢Â€Â.

Support for Terrorists:

The day after the killing by Israel of Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, Abu Jahjah eulogized him in an X post, praising HezbollahÃ¢Â€Â™s support for Hamas and for its role in the Syrian civil war, in which Hezbollah supported the Assad regime, leading to multiple atrocities, including the mass killing and starving of Palestinians in the Yarmouk refugee camp.

Likewise, the day after Israel killed Hamas leader and architect of the October 7 attacks, Yahya Sinwar, Abou Jahjah eulogized him, calling him a Ã¢Â€Âœresistance leaderÃ¢Â€Â who Ã¢Â€Âœshowed the way.Ã¢Â€Â",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

The attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7, 2023, had profound and far-reaching effects on Israelis, Jewish communities around the world and many others.Ã‚Â  Across Latin American, several Jewish communities faced a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents, diverse government responses, and escalating security concerns. The aftermath of this attack has not only exposed the vulnerability of Jewish populations in the region but has also highlighted the complex geopolitical dynamics that influence the safety and well-being of these communities.

In addition, the presence of the Iranian-regime back Hezbollah terrorist organization in the region further exacerbates these tensions, posing a direct threat to Jewish communities. The dismantling of Islamic terrorist cells in Argentina and Brazil underscores the severity of the threat, highlighting the need for vigilance and proactive measures to ensure the safety of Jewish communities.

Historically, antisemitism in Latin America tends to spike during conflicts in Israel and the Middle East, though not to the same degree as in other regions. In Latin America, these incidents are generally confined to acts of vandalism, isolated acts of violence, and a significant rise in online hate speech and media disinformation. Unlike Europe and the US, where antisemitic attacks can be more frequent and severe, Latin American antisemitism manifests primarily in graffiti, harassment, and biased governments and media coverage. Social media platforms become hotbeds for spreading antisemitic rhetoric, often fueled by disinformation, misinformation and anti-Zionist narratives promoted by certain regional media outlets.

Rising Antisemitism: A Disturbing Trend

The surge in antisemitism across Latin America following the Hamas October 7 attack is deeply worrisome. Countries like Brazil, Argentina and Chile have seen a significant increase in antisemitic vandalism, harassment, online hate speech, and even threats against Jewish institutions.Ã‚Â 

The most egregious examples include violent protests outside Jewish institutions in Chile, which involved antisemitic rhetoric. In Uruguay, during the annual International WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s March, a group of women and girls marched showcasing an antisemitic puppet marked with a Star of David and pierced by a spear. In Brazil, there was a verbal and physical attack on a Jewish store owner, and in Mexico City there were attempts to set the Israeli embassy on fire.Ã‚Â 

Argentina experienced a 44% increase in antisemitic incidents in 2023 compared to 2022, according to the DelegaciÃƒÂ³n de Asociaciones Israelitas de Argentina (DAIA). 57% of the incidents reported in 2023 occurred during the October-December period. 65% of antisemitic incidents occurred online and 35% in person, a sharp increase from 2022 when only 19% of the antisemitic cases occurred in person.Ã‚Â 

In Brazil, CONIB reported that between October 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, there were 1,119 reports, an increase of 800% compared to 125 incidents reported during the same period in 2022.Ã‚Â 

In Mexico, mentions of the conflict in social media skyrocketed after October 7th, rising from an average of 13,000 daily mentions before October 7th, to 171,000 per day after the attack, with 28% of these mentions being negative with antisemitic undertones.Ã‚Â 

These figures underscore the severity of the spike in antisemitism in the region, exacerbated by protests and online hate speech targeting Jewish communities and institutions.

Government Responses: A Mixed Bag

The responses of Latin American governments to the October 7 attack and the subsequent rise in antisemitism have been varied and, in some cases, deeply troubling. Countries like Colombia and Bolivia have taken provocative stances, severing diplomatic ties with Israel and, in the case of Colombia, even fueling antisemitic rhetoric through inflammatory statements by President Gustavo Petro. Likewise, Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, whose country severed ties with Israel in 2009, has made incendiary remarks against Israel and Zionists. These actions have left Jewish communities feeling vulnerable and mourning the loss of their countries' traditional closeness with Israel, their ancestral homeland.

Brazil, Chile, and Mexico have shown less support for Israel in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks, often aligning with international efforts to delegitimize the Jewish state. Even as few of these countriesÃ¢Â€Â™ citizens were fatal victims or were taken as hostages by Hamas, these nationsÃ¢Â€Â™ governments have backed measures in international legal forums, notably those spearheaded by South Africa, aimed at isolating Israel on the global stage. Brazil, under President Lula, has taken a more critical stance on Israeli policies, while Chile's government, led by President Gabriel Boric, has been openly hostile, recalling its ambassador from Israel and pursuing accusations of war crimes against Israel in international courts. Mexico, traditionally more neutral, has also shifted towards supporting anti-Israel resolutions, reflecting a broader regional trend of distancing from Israel and aligning with movements that challenge its legitimacy in global institutions.

Peru and El Salvador condemned Hamas for the October 7th attack, but their responses have since become more neutral and lukewarm. Initially aligned with global condemnation, both countries have avoided taking strong pro-Israel positions as the conflict continued. In contrast, Ecuador showed more active support, with its Foreign Minister visiting Israel amidst the war in September 2024.

On the other hand, the governments of Argentina, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Panama, Paraguay and Uruguay, have taken a more supportive approach, maintaining (and even strengthening) diplomatic relations with Israel while enhancing security around Jewish institutions. These countries have recognized the seriousness of the threat and have acted swiftly to protect their Jewish citizens. However, the overall landscape remains precarious, with the actions of some governments contributing to a hostile environment for Jewish communities in the region.

The Role of Disinformation: HispanTV's Influence

The spread of antisemitic and anti-Israel disinformation by media outlets like HispanTV has played a nefarious role in shaping public opinion and inciting antisemitism in Latin America. This Iranian-backed Spanish-language channel has been a prominent platform for promoting anti-Zionist narratives, directly contributing to the rise of antisemitic sentiment across the region. The influence of such media outlets cannot be underestimated, as they fuel hostility towards Jewish communities and severely harm efforts to combat antisemitism.

Security Concerns: The Growing Threat of Terrorism

In addition to the rise in antisemitism, Jewish communities in Latin America face a significant threat from Islamist terrorist networks, particularly Hezbollah. The presence of these networks in the Tri-Border Area between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay poses a direct threat to Jewish institutions. The successful dismantling of an Islamic terrorist cell in Mendoza, Argentina, in August 2024 and a Brazilian cell in November 2023 is a stark reminder of the immediate risk these groups pose. While this operation prevented further attacks, the existence of such networks remains a pressing security concern for both local governments and Jewish communities.

Community Resilience: A Call for Vigilance and Cooperation

Despite these challenges, Jewish communities across Latin America have shown resilience. They have organized public awareness campaigns, worked closely with local governments to enhance security, and taken proactive measures to protect themselves. However, the long-term effects of this rising antisemitism and the broader geopolitical landscape remain uncertain. The situation calls for continued vigilance, cooperation between Jewish communities and authorities, and proactive measures to safeguard the future of Jewish life in Latin America.

Ã¢Â€Â‹Ã¢Â€Â‹Ã‚Â 
ConclusionÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â‹Ã¢Â€Â‹Ã¢Â€Â‹

The October 7, 2023, attack on Israel has had a deep effect on Jewish communities in Latin America, causing a rise in antisemitism, diplomatic tensions, and increasing security risks. Regional governments have responded in varied waysÃ¢Â€Â”some offering protection, while others have worsened the situation with negative provocative actions and rhetoric. Disinformation and Islamist terrorist networks, including those funded by and backed by the Iranian-regime, add to the complexity, making the safety of Jewish communities a critical issue.Ã‚Â 

While Jewish communities must stay alert and collaborate with authorities to safeguard their security, Latin American governments must do more to ensure their Jewish communities are better protected and antisemitism is addressed in a more meaningful way. This includes adopting the IHRA definition, declaring Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist organizations, investigating the links between HispanTV and sanctioned Iranian regime entities and officials, and designating HispanTV as a foreign state influence operation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Furthermore, governments must integrate comprehensive educational programs that highlight both the rich history of local Jewish communities and the Holocaust, which will contribute towards promoting cultural and religious awareness, dispelling ignorance and hate, and fostering understanding and respect.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Failure on the part of Latin American governments to take concrete steps aimed at seriously addressing issues of antisemitism will likely have broad implications beyond the Jewish community, adversely impacting many aspects of society and beyond.","[1, 3, 4]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.5}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/happy-rosh-hashanah,"As we begin the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah tomorrow at sundown, we want to share insights from ADL Rabbinic Fellow David Wolpe with you. We hope that everyone in the ADL community can find something important to consider in his essay about how we can all aspire to push for a world without hate in the days to come.

Although Rosh HashanahÃ¢Â€Â¯often sparks thoughts about the state of theÃ¢Â€Â¯world, it also asks us to look inside ourselves. I find the teaching that follows helpful both to understand how I should look at events and how I should hold myself in a frightening and unsettling time.

Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler was a spiritual guideÃ¢Â€Â¯in IsraelÃ¢Â€Â¯in theÃ¢Â€Â¯1900s. He taught somethingÃ¢Â€Â¯very wiseÃ¢Â€Â¯about our internal battles that is importantÃ¢Â€Â¯for everyoneÃ¢Â€Â¯to remember in this year of so much tumult and discord and pain.Ã¢Â€Â¯I want to shareÃ¢Â€Â¯his insightsÃ¢Â€Â¯with you and the entire ADL communityÃ¢Â€Â¯as we approach the Jewish High Holidays.

Napoleon once declared that every battle is decided in the first fifteen minutes. Rabbi Dessler points to a sort of parallel in internal battles, but it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t even take fifteen minutes. Indeed, he says,Ã¢Â€Â¯certain battles are decided before the battle is even joined. Ã‚Â 

Let me explain:

Dessler taught that all of us have aÃ¢Â€Â¯nukudat bechira Ã¢Â€Â“ a tipping point in making decisions. For every person that point is different. If you put two salads in front of me, I have to choose which one to eat. But if you place a salad and a ham sandwich in front of me, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t have to choose. Because I keep kosher and therefore donÃ¢Â€Â™t eat pork products (and moreover am a vegetarian!), there is noÃ¢Â€Â¯decision point needed.Ã¢Â€Â¯A prior choice has already been made.Ã¢Â€Â¯The battle was long since won. I stand, in terms of the food decision, in conquered territory.

On this Rosh Hashanah,Ã¢Â€Â¯we understand that much of what has happened this year has forced people to make choices: how they will react, how vocal they will be, how to relate to others who do not share the same views. On October 7, in the face of the horror that is ongoing, many people had to make a choice and to hold fast to what was right (and sadly, for some, to what was not right) throughout the year. But for manyÃ¢Â€Â¯of us,Ã¢Â€Â¯theÃ¢Â€Â¯real choiceÃ¢Â€Â¯cameÃ¢Â€Â¯long ago. We knew we would speak up against prejudice and hatred and antisemitism. Ã‚Â 

Now we face a new year. NewÃ¢Â€Â¯yearsÃ¢Â€Â¯are not only about resolutions to change, they are about renewing the convictions we already carry, the choices we have already made. God, ourÃ¢Â€Â¯teachingsÃ¢Â€Â¯tellÃ¢Â€Â¯us, renews creation daily. We too renew ourselves daily. After the anguish of the year that hasÃ¢Â€Â¯passed, this Rosh Hashanah will bring us more strength, greater resolveÃ¢Â€Â¯and a deeper sense of the community of those who share our passions. It is a time to strengthen the choices we have already made to speak up against the proliferating hatreds and prejudices that threaten us, Israel and the larger human community. Ã‚Â 

The Jewish people,Ã¢Â€Â¯along withÃ¢Â€Â¯those who supportÃ¢Â€Â¯the JewishÃ¢Â€Â¯people,Ã¢Â€Â¯are going through a time of trial. Rosh HashanahÃ¢Â€Â¯is here to remind us of what we already believe, the choices we have made long ago inside ourselves: to fight for what is good, to believe in the possibility ofÃ¢Â€Â¯change, to broaden our embrace and deepen our souls.Ã¢Â€Â¯May this year find us true to the missions we have already accepted, and be prepared for new undertakings to better ourselves, preserve our people and heal the world.

As we forge ahead, ADL is so grateful to have your support in thisÃ¢Â€Â¯struggleÃ¢Â€Â¯for a better world, Fighting Hate for Good.

We send you and yours wishes of health and happiness in the year to come.","[3, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.8, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-appoints-fbi-veteran-vice-president-global-safety-security,"New York, NY, October 1, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today appointed veteran federal law enforcement executive Steve Gonzalez as its new vice president of global safety and security. A longtime leader at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Gonzalez most recently served as assistant special agent in charge of the FBIÃ¢Â€Â™s New York Criminal Division.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are pleased to welcome Steve Gonzalez into our top security leadership position at ADL,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœIn the wake of the October 7 massacre in Israel, the Jewish community has faced a rising tide of antisemitism and emerging security threats that we could never have imagined a year ago. SteveÃ¢Â€Â™s experience will help us to detect, monitor and mitigate these threats and to coordinate our work directly with national and local law enforcement as well as with law enforcement agencies overseas.Ã¢Â€Â

Gonzalez has served nearly 26 years in government service. After serving as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy, he joined the FBI as a special agent assigned to the New York Division, where he worked on international terrorism investigations as part of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. In 2014, he was promoted to Supervisory Special Agent in the FBIÃ¢Â€Â™s counterterrorism division headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Two years later he returned to the New York Criminal Division to establish the first ever Joint Major Theft Task Force. Throughout his tenure, the NY criminal division has successfully executed hundreds of arrests and indictments of transnational organized crime syndicates.

In addition to his experience leading criminal investigations, Gonzalez is a licensed clinical and forensic psychologist, and throughout his tenure in New York he has served as a member of the Crisis Negotiation Team and field coordinator for the bureauÃ¢Â€Â™s Behavioral Analysis Unit.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWith the rise of hate crimes and terrorism at home and abroad, I cannot think of another law enforcement leader more experienced and capable than Steve to sustain the ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s unique role in protecting our freedoms and human values,Ã¢Â€Â said former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh. Ã¢Â€ÂœIt has been my privilege to be SteveÃ¢Â€Â™s FBI colleague for many years, where his leadership in overseeing complex investigations, counterterrorism, hate crimes, national security and international threat mattersÃ‚Â is renowned and immensely respected.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœSteve Gonzalez is an inspired choice for this position. His depth and experience from his many years in the FBI have forged a well-rounded investigator,Ã¢Â€Â said John Miller, former NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Counterterrorism. Ã¢Â€ÂœSteve has led teams in criminal investigation, counterterrorism cases, and worked with multiple agencies on task forces involved in mitigating the most dangerous threats.Ã¢Â€Â

In his new role at ADL, Gonzalez will be charged with overseeing all aspects of security operations at ADL. ADL Global Security leads the planning and deployment of strategies and programs to support the safety and security of ADL staff, physical offices and public events around the world.

Gonzalez is a graduate of Tufts University, where he earned a bachelorÃ¢Â€Â™s degree in clinical psychology. He holds a Psy.D. and M.S. in Clinical Psychology (forensic concentration) from Nova Southeastern University, College of Psychology.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-social-media-scorecard-finds-major-platforms-routinely-fail-act,"New York, NY, September 30, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ A new scorecard released today by ADL (Anti-Defamation League) found that five major social media platforms Ã¢Â€Â“ Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and X Ã¢Â€Â“ routinely fail to act on antisemitic hate reported through regular channels available to users.Ã‚Â 

The ADL Center for Technology and Society (CTS) evaluated both policy and enforcement around antisemitism and issued grades to each of the five platforms based on a fixed set of criteria.

X (formerly Twitter) scored the lowest with an Ã¢Â€ÂœFÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â“ as most of the platformÃ¢Â€Â™s actions consisted in limiting the problematic contentÃ¢Â€Â™s visibility. While ADL credited X for taking action, X did not, like other platforms, remove the hateful content. Additionally, Facebook and TikTok each received a Ã¢Â€ÂœCÃ¢Â€Â; YouTube and Instagram each earned a Ã¢Â€ÂœC-minus.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœSocial media platforms are still falling far too short when it comes to moderating antisemitic and anti-Israel content,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. Ã¢Â€ÂœIn the aftermath of the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, Jewish users are encountering more antisemitic slurs and harassment on social media than ever before. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not hard to detect this hate, but it takes leadership to consistently enforce the rules.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL researchers tested how well the five platforms enforced their policies against hateful content in two specific areas: antisemitic conspiracy theories, and the term Ã¢Â€ÂœZionistÃ¢Â€Â used as a slur. The scorecard found that while all five platforms have appropriate policies in place to respond to such hateful rhetoric (except for X, which does not have a policy specifically prohibiting misinformation), they routinely fell short on enforcement for average users.

The scorecard also found that most platforms only took action when ADL escalated the reports through direct channels unavailable to regular users. And even then, platforms only acted on some of the hateful content.Ã‚Â 

In the year since Oct. 7, ADL hasÃ‚Â documented a dramatic increase in antisemitic hate online.Ã‚Â ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual report on online hate and harassment found that 47 percent of Jews saw antisemitic content or conspiracy theories related to the Israeli-Hamas war, compared to 29 percent of Americans overall. The hateful language has in many cases shifted, however, and new antisemitic conspiracy theories have taken shape alongside the resurfacing of old ones.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe have published several studies evaluating how platforms respond to antisemitism when reported by average users. Disturbingly, this scorecard had the worst response rate for average user reporting weÃ¢Â€Â™ve ever seen,Ã¢Â€Â said Daniel Kelley, Interim Director of the ADL Center for Technology and Society. Ã¢Â€ÂœThough we are encouraged by the actions platforms took when we reported through our Ã¢Â€Â˜trusted flaggerÃ¢Â€Â™ channels, we urge tech companies to conduct comprehensive audits of how their platforms moderate antisemitic content to understand why this deeply concerning gap exists between platform policy and user reporting.Ã¢Â€Â
Ã‚Â 

Methodology

To test each platformÃ¢Â€Â™s enforcement of its antisemitism policies, ADL first reported individual pieces of content using tools available to a regular user. After a week, researchers checked to see whether any action had been taken. For content where no action or partial action (such as limiting the contentÃ¢Â€Â™s visibility) was taken, ADL escalated the content to direct points of contact at the companies, most often via Ã¢Â€Â˜trusted flaggerÃ¢Â€Â™ partnerships.Ã‚Â 

ADL also evaluated each platformÃ¢Â€Â™s policies on antisemitic conspiracy theories and slurs. When comparing policies to actual content, nuances often arise, making case-by-case determinations necessary for a large share of potentially violative content. Each piece of content escalated to the platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ trusted flaggers was evaluated by ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s internal experts on the platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ policies.Ã‚Â 

Following the trusted flaggersÃ¢Â€Â™ reviews of the remaining content, ADL evaluated each platform on its rate of action against content reported as a regular user and its cumulative rate of action after trusted flagger escalations.


Recommendations for PlatformsÃ‚Â 

Improve user reporting. Although we recognize the challenges of moderating at scale, these platforms should be able to ingest reports, review content, and act on clearly hateful content in less than a week.
Fix the gap between policy and enforcement. Companies should begin by conducting an internal audit to assess 1) whether staff are prepared to recognize and act on antisemitic content; 2) whether current policies address the multidimensional nature of antisemitism; 3) their enforcement capacity and effectiveness; and 4) support mechanisms for users who encounter or are targeted by antisemitic hate and harassment.
Provide independent researchers with data access, including access to archives of moderated content.
Review reported content in context. Multiple reports or other signals on a single piece of content may provide context for content that otherwise does not appear violative.
Follow emerging trends and adversarial shifts as they shift over time. These changes have only accelerated for antisemitic hate since Oct. 7.

Boston, MA, September 30, 2024 ... The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), and StandWithUs, along with a coalition of leading law firms, today announced the launch of a helpline in K-12 schools to provide pro bono legal assistance to parents whose children are experiencing antisemitism in Massachusetts and New York. The helpline follows a successful pilot program in California, the first state for which the hotline was launched after a series of troubling antisemitic incidents in the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s K-12 schools.

Antisemitic incidents in elementary, middle and high schools in MA and NY have increased significantly over the last year. ReportedÃ‚Â incidents in K-12 schools in MA nearly doubled in 2023 -- 101 (up from 53 incidents in 2022)Ã‚Â whileÃ‚Â incidents in K-12 schools in NY climbed to 173 (up from 53 incidents in in 2022).

The alarming rise in both the sheer number and intensity of antisemitic incidents in K-12 schools in New York and Massachusetts have made it clear that parents, students and educators need an option for legal help,Ã‚Â said Peggy Shukur, ADL Vice President, East Division. Ã¢Â€ÂœParticularly in situations where responses to antisemitism are inadequate or worse, access to high-quality legal assistance is a crucial tool to ensure a safe learning environment. By providing these legal efforts, this helpline will empower Jewish students, teachers and parents to take action to fight against antisemitic harassment and bigotry.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœDay after day, students across our state are facing a barrage of antisemitic incidents in K-12 schools,Ã¢Â€Â said Scott Richman, ADL NY/NJ Regional Director. Ã¢Â€ÂœIncreasingly, those incidents have required legal assistance. Alongside our impactful anti-hate education programs, this pro bono legal helpline is a welcome addition to the arsenal of tools at our disposal to fight the antisemitic prejudice that we see in our schools.Ã¢Â€Â

As a result of the California K-12 pilot program, in February 2024, Brandeis and ADL filed aÃ‚Â complaint with the U.S. Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) against the Berkeley school district for failing to take action to end the nonstop bullying and harassment of Jewish students by peers and teachers.Ã‚Â Since its launch, the CA hotline has received an influx of K-12 incidents. These include a wide variety of antisemitic incident reports includingÃ‚Â Jewish students being harassed, intimidated, and threatened with violence because of their religion.

""The barrage of anti-Semitic harassment, intimidation, and attacks against Jewish students is unfortunately not contained within the campus gates,Ã¢Â€Â stated Brandeis Center Vice Chair and General Counsel Rachel Lerman. ""Coast to coast, Jewish K-12 students have been verbally and physically bullied, threatened, and assaulted by peers who absorb anti-Israel and antisemitic rhetoric from some of their teachers. They have been told they are hated and should all be killed, spat on, called dirty Jew, told to go to the gas chambers, slandered, and threatened with violence.Ã‚Â Administrations cannot be allowed to turn a blind eye to the intimidation, bullying and anti-Semitic rhetoric their students endure within their schools. Our team of lawyers stand ready to use the law to hold schools accountable to enforce their own rules as Jewish students are subjected to a virulently hostile environment. This must stop.""Ã‚Â 

Parents, teachers, and other interested adults in MA and NY can use theÃ‚Â Legal Protection K-12 Helpline to report incidents of antisemitic discrimination, intimidation, harassment, vandalism or violence that may necessitate legal action. Lawyers will conduct in-depth information-gathering interviews with persons who file reports. In some instances, they may provide pro bono representation on behalf of victims or provide referrals to organizations that can provide non-legal assistance. The lawyers will also, with permission of the individuals involved, use the reports to better understand the scope of the problem and report it to officials responsible for ensuring the laws are followed. If schools do not take action, they will be held accountable.

Ã¢Â€ÂœCJPÃ¢Â€Â™s Center for Combating Antisemitism is excited to support this important hotline as a proactive resource for parents, educators, and students,Ã¢Â€Â said Melissa Garlick, Senior Director, Combating Antisemitism and Building Civic Engagement at Combined Jewish Philanthropies (CJP). Ã¢Â€ÂœThis initiative will serve as a valuable tool for our community to help address and prevent antisemitism, offering guidance, support, and solutions to foster safe and respectful learning environments. By working together, weÃ¢Â€Â™re empowering school communities to not only respond to incidents but to build a culture of inclusion, understanding, and mutual respect.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœConsistent with our longstanding commitment to combating antisemitism in schools, on campus, and within the community, StandWithUs remains proud to be part of this coalition dedicated to protecting K-12 students from antisemitic harassment and discrimination, said Carly Gammill, Director of Legal Policy at the StandWithUs Saidoff Legal Department. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe expansion of the initiative into Massachusetts and New York comes at a time when antisemitism continues to plague students in our nationÃ¢Â€Â™s schools and will help ensure broader access to legal resources for students seeking to address attacks against their Jewish identity.

This expansion builds upon continued efforts to address antisemitism in a variety of educational settings. In November 2023, Brandeis and ADL, along with Hillel International, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, and other leading law firms, launched theÃ‚Â Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL), a helpline to assist students and faculty experiencing antisemitism on college campuses. More thanÃ‚Â 650 college students and faculty have used this important resource to report incidents and request assistance.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits educational institutions that receive federal funding from discriminating against, or allowing others to discriminate against, students on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, and national origin. Title VI protects Jews based on their shared ancestral and ethnic identity. The Department of EducationÃ¢Â€Â™s Office for Civil Rights recognizes that harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful under Title VI.

Today, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) announced an expanded partnership with Moishe House to launch fifteen new Ã¢Â€ÂœWords to ActionÃ¢Â€Â trainings across Europe, Latin America, and Israel. This initiative aims to equip Jewish young adults in their 20s with the tools and knowledge to recognize and combat antisemitism in their communities. As the new academic year begins, it's crucial to support not only Jewish students on campus but also young Jews who, despite no longer being students, are still facing a surge in antisemitism.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Across Europe, America, and beyond, tensions in the Middle East have often fueled a rise in antisemitic incidents, especially in the aftermath of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7 attack on Israel. With nearly 40% of people in seven countries with significant Jewish populations endorsing antisemitic tropes, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Words to Action has become a highly sought-after program. It equips Jewish youth with tools to understand and confront antisemitism, anti-Israel bias, stereotypes, and antisemitic hate speech. Notably, antisemitism is most prevalent among Millennials (b. 1981-1996) in these countries, a main target age group of Moishe House participants.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

In response to the surge in antisemitism worldwide, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€Â˜Words to ActionÃ¢Â€Â™ program, led by experienced educators in 29 countries, continues to empower young leaders to address antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. Through this program, participants gain tools to tackle antisemitic stereotypes, prejudice, hate speech, and bias incidents.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœAs antisemitism continues to spread across borders and communities, itÃ¢Â€Â™s crucial that Jewish young adults are equipped with the tools and knowledge to effectively respond to antisemitism. By expanding our partnership with Moishe House, we are empowering a new generation to build resilience and confidently stand up against antisemitism.Ã¢Â€Â said Dalia Grinfeld, ADL Associate Director for European Affairs.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

""We are honored to expand our partnership with the Anti-Defamation League. This partnership will provide our community builders the opportunity to gain the knowledge and confidence needed to stand up to antisemitism as they create and lead their own local Jewish communities. Leadership development is an important part of being a Moishe House community builder and knowing how to appropriately handle situations of antisemitism is, unfortunately, a critical skillset for young Jewish leaders today. This partnership is not just about addressing today's challenges of rising antisemitism but about equipping our community builders to help build a future where every Jewish person can thrive free from discrimination and prejudice,Ã¢Â€Â said David Cygielman, Moishe House Founder and CEO.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/new-fbi-data-reflects-record-high-number-anti-jewish-hate-crimes,"Anti-Jewish hate crimes increased by 63% since 2023, FBI reports

New York, NY, September 23, 2024Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã‚Â  Data released today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation reveals that reported hate crime incidents across the country reached a record high of 11,862 in 2023. In 2023, reported single-bias anti-Jewish hate crime incidents rose to 1,832 incidents, a sharp increase of 63 percent from 2022, and the highest number ever recorded by the FBI since it began collecting data in 1991.

Although Jews only make up aroundÃ‚Â 2 percent of the U.S. population, reported single-bias anti-Jewish hate crimes comprised 15 percent of all hate crimes and 68 percent of all reported religion-based hate crimes in 2023, which is consistent with patterns from prior years.

Ã¢Â€ÂœAt a time when the Jewish community is still suffering from the sharp rise in antisemitism following HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, the record-high number of anti-Jewish hate crime incidents is unfortunately entirely consistent with the Jewish communityÃ¢Â€Â™s experience and ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s tracking,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœHate crimes are uniquely harmful, traumatizing both the individual and their community.Ã¢Â€Â

According to the FBI data, a clear majority of hate crime incidents across the country (approximately 51.5 percent) in 2023 were motivated by bias based on race, ethnicity or national origin Ã¢Â€Â“ as has been the case for decades Ã¢Â€Â“ with reported anti-Black hate crimes comprising the single largest portion of those incidents.Ã‚Â Reported single-bias anti-Hispanic or Latino hate crime incidents increased from 738 in 2022 to 812 in 2023. Reported single-bias anti-Muslim hate crime incidents rose from 158 in 2022 to 236 in 2023. Reported anti-LGBTQ+ hate crime incidents increasedÃ‚Â from 2,391 in 2022 to 2,557 in 2023. And reported single-bias religion-based hate crimes, which represented approximately 23 percent of all reported hate crimes, rose from 2,042 in 2022 to 2,699 in 2023.

ADL, which keeps its own count of both criminal and non-criminal acts of hate against Jews, counted a total of 8,873Ã‚Â antisemitic incidents in 2023, a 140-percent increase from the prior year, and the highest number on record since ADL began tracking such data in 1979. Assaults Ã¢Â€Â“ considered the most serious incident type because it involves person-on-person physical violence Ã¢Â€Â“ increased by 45 percent in 2023.

According to the FBI data released today, a total of 16,009 law enforcement agencies, which represent 83.5 percent of the agencies enrolled in the hate crime data collection program, participated in hate crimes reporting for 2023. Despite an increase in the number of law enforcement agencies that participated in reporting data to the FBI in 2023 Ã¢Â€Â“ for the first time in six years Ã¢Â€Â“ far too many agencies still either do not participate in reporting or are likely not participating in a fully accurate way.

Ã¢Â€ÂœAlthough itÃ¢Â€Â™s encouraging to see more law enforcement agencies participating in reporting hate crimes data in 2023, we still have a long way to go toward ensuring comprehensive data collection that provides a more accurate picture of the lived experience of targeted communities across the country,Ã¢Â€Â said Greenblatt. Ã¢Â€ÂœData drives policy, and without having a complete understanding of the problem, we cannot effectively address this significant surge in hate violence.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL calls on Congress to pass the Improved Reporting to Prevent Hate Act, which would require law enforcement agencies to credibly report hate crimes to the FBI to be eligible for certain federal funding. In addition, ADL urges Congress to pass the Countering Antisemitism Act, which would ensure that the policies and infrastructure of the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism are made permanent.","[1, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Their joint initiative, Ã¢Â€ÂœA Light in the City,Ã¢Â€Â aims to foster friendship and understanding by hosting Shabbat dinners in four key cities.

Ã‚Â 

The pilot program, to take place in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York City, and Washington D.C. in the fall, is meant to convene young Jewish and Christian professionals in their 20s and 30s for intimate Shabbat dinners. These gatherings, spearheaded by a young leader from each community, will serve as a platform for building relationships, sparking meaningful conversations, and fostering partnerships within each community.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 
From Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO, ADL:Ã‚Â 
Ã¢Â€ÂœIn these challenging times, it's crucial that we come together to foster understanding and build lasting connections. This initiative between ADL and Passages Israel, with support from OneTable, is a testament to our commitment to combating hate and promoting mutual respect in our communities. In times of great division, we here at ADL respond with unity, fostering connections and understanding through initiatives like Ã¢Â€Â˜A Light in the City.Ã¢Â€Â™ By bringing together Jewish and Christian communities, we are committed to combating hate and building bridges.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

From Rivka Kidron, Co-Founder of Passages Israel:Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe more the Jewish and Christian communities come together, the more we can deepen our understanding of each otherÃ¢Â€Â™s unique challenges and also strengthen our collective resolve. The Jewish People face grave current challenges, and many in the Christian community want to stand shoulder to shoulder with their Jewish colleagues and the State of Israel during this time of heightened threats. This initiative is a timely opportunity to engage and create greater understanding and relationships between our communities, with the common goal of fostering solidarity, unity and commonality of purpose against those who spread hate, division and antisemitism.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

From Aliza Kline, CEO, OneTableÃ‚Â 
Ã¢Â€ÂœShabbat dinner is an ideal time for people to come together, break bread, and experience Ã¢Â€Â“ first hand Ã¢Â€Â“ Jewish wisdom and joy. Since Oct. 7, more than 80,000 young people have participated in OneTable Shabbat dinners and a growing number of them are intentionally including peers who are not Jewish. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s a beautiful thing to open up Shabbat dinners to guests who are not Jewish in order to share Jewish connection and joy with them.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The Shabbat dinners will be held in the homes of ADL young professionals or other appropriate venues, with each event hosting a maximum of 10-15 attendees to ensure a personal and engaging experience.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

To encourage organic, meaningful conversations between attendees, ADL and Passages Israel are working with OneTable to develop a table talk resource. We are hopeful that this interfaith Shabbat guide Ã¢Â€Â“ specifically designed for Jews and Christians Ã¢Â€Â“ will serve as a model for other interfaith programs. Discussions will be led by ADL hosts, their Passages Israel counterpart, Passages Israel alumni and other young Jewish professionals. Conversations will address current challenges faced by their communities and explore ways to support one another in a post-October 7 world.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-joins-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-against-intel,"New York, NY, September 19, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced it is joiningÃ‚Â Wigdor LLP as co-counsel in an employment discrimination lawsuit against Intel, marking the first time in recent history the anti-hate organization has filed suit against a major Fortune 500 company for alleged antisemitic discrimination in the workplace.

TheÃ‚Â complaint in John Doe v. Intel CorporationÃ‚Â alleges that Intel failed to address a hostile work environment, discriminated against the plaintiff because of his national origin, religion, race and ethnicity, and ultimately retaliated against him for reporting the discrimination.

The plaintiff Ã¢Â€Â“ an Israeli living and working in New York Ã¢Â€Â“ was assigned to report to an Intel executive who bullied and undermined him, as well as publicly amplified social media messages celebrating the murder of Israelis. When the plaintiff, who had outstanding performance reviews and had recently been promoted, reported the anti-Israel hostility and discriminatory workplace conduct, Intel removed him from his job and forced him into a lower-paying role.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe cannot allow antisemitism to threaten the livelihoods of workers and their families,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. Ã¢Â€ÂœIntel failed to protect a talented Israeli employee from workplace discrimination, instead punishing him for raising concerns about his hostile anti-Israel manager. ADL is committed to holding Intel accountable for this injustice and reminding all businesses that such bigotry is unacceptable.Ã¢Â€Â

This announcement comes on the heels of IntelÃ¢Â€Â™s opposition to the plaintiffÃ¢Â€Â™s request to remain unnamed in public court documents Ã¢Â€Â“ a decision that will risk the safety of the plaintiff and his family.

Antisemitism in the workplace mirrors dramatic increases of antisemitism in society. ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents counted a total of 8,873Ã‚Â antisemitic incidents in 2023,Ã‚Â aÃ‚Â 140-percent increaseÃ‚Â from 2022 Ã¢Â€Â“ already a record-setting year Ã¢Â€Â“ and the highest level recorded since ADL started tracking this data in 1979. Antisemitic attitudes are also at record levels, with 24 percent of Americans harboring extensive antisemitic beliefs, an increase from 20 percent in 2022.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are thrilled that ADL has decided to join us in prosecuting this important case against Intel,Ã¢Â€Â said Douglas H. Wigdor, Founding Partner, Wigdor LLP.Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœWe share ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s mission in fighting antisemitism and look forward to working with them in sending a clear message to corporate America that defamation of the Jewish people will not be tolerated in the workplace.Ã¢Â€Â

The complaint, which was originally filed on August 13, 2024, in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, urges the Court to rule that IntelÃ¢Â€Â™s actions violated the law, and to order Intel to permanently halt such unlawful conduct. The complaint also urges the Court to award damages to compensate the Plaintiff for harm suffered as a direct result of IntelÃ¢Â€Â™s unlawful and discriminatory conduct, as well as punitive damages.

This lawsuit builds on ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s efforts to combat workplace antisemitism. More than 100 major corporations have signed on to the ADL Ã¢Â€ÂœWorkplace Pledge to Fight Antisemitism,Ã¢Â€Â committing toÃ‚Â address antisemitism in Diversity, Equity, and InclusionÃ‚Â programs, support Jewish employees throughÃ‚Â Employee Resource GroupsÃ‚Â or other means, provideÃ‚Â religious accommodationsÃ‚Â for employees, and speak out against antisemitism. AsÃ‚Â partÃ‚Â of the White HouseÃ¢Â€Â™s National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, every Fortune 500 company received ADL information on antisemitism, religious accommodations, and Jewish culture and contributions.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/largest-100-university-endowments-could-lose-33-billion-over-10-years-if,"New York, NY, September 19, 2024Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â¦ Adopting anÃ‚Â Israel divestmentÃ‚Â strategy aligned with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement could lead to significant negative financial implications for university endowments, finds a report released today by JLens, the leading Jewish values-based investor network, part of the ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) family.Ã‚Â 

The report, the first of its kind to thoroughly quantify these risks, analyzed the historical performance of two hypothetical large-cap U.S. equity portfolios: one broadly diversified without restrictions and another excluding companies targeted by BDS campaigns such as Alphabet, Amazon, Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin and Microsoft. Due to the effect of compounding interest, the 1.8 percent performance gap between the two portfolios (an annualized return difference of 11.1 percent compared to 12.9 percent) translates to substantial differences in returns over time.

The full report includes detailed forecasts for the 100 largest university endowments, if the universities were to invest based on BDS-aligned divestment strategies from 2023 to 2033. For example, Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Princeton are projected to collectively lose more than $8 billion in estimated returns on their endowments over the decade. Brown University, which is actively considering demands for Israel divestment, could miss out on an estimated $309,787,060 in returns on its $6 billion endowment.

These 100 largest U.S. university endowments could collectively forgo $33.2 billion in returns over the next decade if they adopt BDS-aligned investment strategies.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœCalls for universities to divest from companies doing business in Israel are not only morally dangerous, but may also be financially dangerous,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœUniversity investment committees have a fiduciary responsibility to prudently steward institutional resources.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœOur research demonstrates that university endowments that divest from Israel could face significant financial consequences,Ã¢Â€Â said Ari Hoffnung, JLens Managing Director and ADL Senior Advisor on Corporate Advocacy. Ã¢Â€ÂœLower investment returns could compromise a universityÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to provide scholarships, fund research, and invest in campus facilities.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis groundbreaking report approaches the morally problematic BDS movement from an entirely new direction - its negative impact on portfolio returns,Ã¢Â€Â said Michael Lustig, Adjunct Professor of Finance at the New York University Stern School of Business and Managing Partner, i4:assemblÃƒÂ©. Ã¢Â€ÂœJLens has done a great job in quantifying the financial effects of implementing the suggestions of this pernicious movement, and importantly, they Ã¢Â€Â˜show their workÃ¢Â€Â™ by providing full transparency into their methodology, and properly caveat the points where assumptions must necessarily be made. This report will prove to be an important tool in helping to fight noxious BDS advocacy.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

TheÃ‚Â Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement seeks to isolate Israel on multiple fronts: diplomatic, financial, professional, academic and cultural. ADL believes that the movementÃ¢Â€Â™s ultimate goal is to delegitimize and pressure Israel, its institutions, and its supporters, including Jewish individuals and community organizations. On campuses, BDS campaigns typically target university endowments, urging divestment from multinational corporations which conduct business in Israel or are accused of supporting IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s actions in the West Bank and Gaza. While some BDS campaigns frame demands within broader human rights concerns, they often focus on undermining IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s legitimacy.Ã‚Â 

In 2022,Ã‚Â ADL incorporated JLens to expand its participation in the responsible investing and shareholder advocacy fields, and to fight efforts by some activists to push for anti-Israel and antisemitic policies in these fields. JLens, a non-profit organization, empowers investors to align their capital with Jewish values and advocates for Jewish communal priorities in the corporate arena.Ã‚Â

ADL-MVRF research and related publications will now be published and available throughÃ‚Â MauraÃ¢Â€Â™s Voice Research Fund and its website.

The research being performed is driving new insights into the behavior of misogynistic violent extremists to support more advanced research, raise public awareness, promote development of effective preventive policy, and through its investigative component, help facilitate intervention to stop planned acts of violence.

Ã¢Â€ÂœRenewing ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s partnership with MauraÃ¢Â€Â™s Voice Research Fund to pursue collaborative research in the field of violent misogynistic extremism is a crucial step in our organizationÃ¢Â€Â™s mission to research, track and prevent all forms of extremism and hate,Ã¢Â€Â said Oren Segal, VP of the ADL Center on Extremism. Ã¢Â€ÂœSimilarly to other partnerships ADL has established and strengthened throughout the years with specialized organizations, it will allow us to deepen our knowledge of misogynistic extremism and to benefit from both organizationÃ¢Â€Â™s expertise and resources to combat it at a time when expressions of hate and violence are surging.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœMy daughter Maura, then a 21-year-old senior at Florida State University, lost her life in a shooting at a Tallahassee Hot Yoga Studio in 2018. This attack also took the life of FSU Medical School Professor Dr. Nancy Van Vessem and wounded four other women.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe must realize that beyond the tragic and often preventable loss of innocent victimsÃ¢Â€Â™ lives and the trauma and shattered dreams suffered by survivorsÃ¢Â€Â¦a hate crime against any one of us is a crime against all of us. Crimes committed by the hands of hate undermine the basic values of a free society.Ã¢Â€Â

Since its launch in 2019 the MauraÃ¢Â€Â™s Voice Research Fund has dedicated its efforts to counter extremist and violent misogyny and prevent violence against women and girls.

Ã¢Â€ÂœOur partnership with the ADL, the oldest and most respected organization dedicated to countering hate, has advanced our ability to perform leading-edge research that not only produces new insights and information, but leads to action in effectively countering hatred and violence against women and girls,Ã¢Â€Â said Dr. David Springer, Dean of the FSU College ofÃ‚Â Social Work. Ã¢Â€ÂœFlorida State University and MauraÃ¢Â€Â™s Voice Research Fund are honored to work with ADL in this important endeavor.Ã¢Â€Â

About MauraÃ¢Â€Â™s Voice

The Maura's Voice Research Fund was established by Maura's parents, Jeff and Margaret Binkley, in memory of their daughter Maura Binkley, a young woman who dedicated her life to serving others. Maura was a senior at FSU who planned to continue the course of her generous life by participating after graduation in the Fulbright Scholarship program.Ã‚Â Maura's Voice Research Fund (Maura's Voice) serves to realize the vision of deepening the scientific understanding of and effective responses to hate fueled violence, and particularly violence against women and girls. Maura's Voice champions a unique and robust focus on researching and responding to the complex causes and effects of hatred and violent extremism. The Fund will develop knowledge for and test innovative approaches to forensic evaluation, management, treatment, and prevention strategies, as well as for sound policy development and implementation.

The ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) Task Force on Middle East Minorities applauds the introduction and urges the swift passage ofÃ‚Â House Resolution 554Ã‚Â affirming the nature and importance of the support of the United States for the religious and ethnic minority survivors of genocide in Iraq.

The resolution reaffirms the unwavering support of the U.S. government for the survivors of genocide among IraqÃ¢Â€Â™s religious and ethnic minority communities. These communitiesÃ¢Â€Â”comprising Yezidis, Turkmen, Shabak, Sabaean-Mandeans, KakaÃ¢Â€Â™i, and indigenous Christians (including Chaldean, Syriac, Assyrian, Armenian, and Melkite groups)Ã¢Â€Â”have been vital to the cultural and historical landscape of Iraq and the broader Middle East for centuries.

Tragically, these communities were subjected to severe atrocities by ISIS, including murder, forced conversion, human trafficking, and the destruction of cultural heritage. The U.S. Secretary of State has formally recognized these acts as genocide and crimes against humanity.

The resolution presents a comprehensive list of priorities including upholding human rights; restoration and return of displaced communities, supplied with rebuilding efforts; ensuring effective political representation; and encouraging greater regional integration and administrative autonomy for minority groups within IraqÃ¢Â€Â™s federal framework.

Reflecting on the historical exodus of the Jewish population from Iraq in 1950s, which wiped out an entire community, and how that represented a significant loss for the rich cultural and historical tapestry of Iraq, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Task Force on Middle East Minorities urges swift passage of House Resolution 554 which would enable the survival of Yezidis, Turkmen, Shabak, Sabaean-Mandeans, KakaÃ¢Â€Â™i, and indigenous Christians in their native lands.

In 2018, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Task Force on Middle East MinoritiesÃ‚Â supported the passing of the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act (H.R.390), which underscores the commitment of the U.S. in directing humanitarian aid to those most in need, especially those targeted by ISIS. The Task Force support for H.R. 554 follows our endorsement of H.R. 390.

Shadi Martini, co-chair of ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Task Force on Middle East Minorities and Chief Executive Director of Multifaith Alliance stated: Ã¢Â€ÂœAs a person who worked directly with ethnic Minorities in Iraq, I know how important the passing of House Resolution 554 is for the minority communities who have been targeted specifically in recent years. I urge Congress to pass the legislation and for the president to sign it into law.Ã¢Â€Â

Nadine Maenza, ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Task Force on Middle East Minorities member and President at IRF Secretariat further added that ""Congress should pass House Resolution 554, urging the U.S. and international community to make upholding the human rights and dignity of religious and ethnic minorities a priority in their Iraq policy. This includes pushing for fair representation in parliament and local governments, appropriate budget allocation by the Iraq Government, continued support by international aid donors, and the safe, dignified, and voluntary return of the displaced.""","[3, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.8, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/significant-increase-campus-anti-israel-activity-marked-support-terror-and,"New York, NY, September 16, 2024, Ã¢Â€Â¦ A total of 2,087 anti-Israel incidentsÃ‚Â of assault, vandalism, harassment, protests/actions and divestment resolutions were recorded on college and university campuses in the United States between June 1, 2023, and May 31, 2024. This represents a 477 percent increase in those same categories compared to the prior school year, according to a new ADL (Anti-Defamation League) report released today.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

The annual campus report from the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) identified a record number of anti-Israel incidents, including 28 assaults. No assaults were recorded in 2022-2023 and only one in 2021-2022. ADL also recorded 1,418 protests and actions (including encampments), 360 instances of targeted verbal or written harassment, 201 instances of vandalism, and 80 BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) resolutions (71 that passed and 9 that were voted down). Some of the incidents counted in this report also referenced classic antisemitic tropes like purported Jewish wealth, greed and control over political affairs.Ã‚Â 

The newly released ADL report also identifies common rhetorical themes such as overt expressions of support for terrorism and violence.Ã‚Â This includes the veneration of theÃ‚Â Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),Ã‚Â Hamas,Ã‚Â Hezbollah andÃ‚Â the Houthis (Ansar Allah); misinformation and disinformation about October 7; removal of hostage fliers and disrupting events memorializing October 7.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe antisemitic, anti-Zionist vitriol weÃ¢Â€Â™ve witnessed on campus is unlike anything weÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen in the past,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœSince the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, the anti-Israel movementÃ¢Â€Â™s relentless harassment, vandalism, intimidations and violent physical assaults go way beyond the peaceful voicing of a political opinion. Administrators and faculty need to do much better this year to ensure a safe and truly inclusive environment for all students, regardless of religion, nationality, or political views, and they need to start now.Ã¢Â€Â

Centers for Jewish life on campus were oftenÃ‚Â targeted by anti-Israel activity over the course of the year; There were at least 73 incidents that directly impacted Hillels and Chabads. Hillels and Chabads were subject toÃ‚Â numerous demands from activists, including calls for their schools to cut ties with both organizations. Protests outside the properties of these organizations and the events they hosted occurred on several campuses.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe surge in incidents of all kinds has dramatically altered Campus life for Jewish students across the United States,Ã¢Â€Â said Oren Segal, Vice President of the ADL Center on Extremism. Ã¢Â€ÂœEscalation tactics, which increasingly normalize the narratives of terror groups and directly target Jewish communities on campus, must be countered with institutional efforts to protect students.Ã¢Â€Â

Key findings include:

Campus groups responsible for much of the recorded anti-Israel activity in this report includeÃ‚Â Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP),Ã‚Â Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and Dissenters.
Anti-Israel incidents impacted over 360 campuses across 46 states and the District of Columbia.Ã‚Â The top 10 campuses with the highest number of reported incidents are Columbia University (52), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (38), Harvard University (36), University of California, Berkeley (36), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) (35), Rutgers University, New Brunswick (33), Stanford University (30), Cornell University (27), University of Washington (26) and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (25). Collectively, these institutions represent 16% of the total incidents.
Students received support from off-campus organizations connected to the broader Palestine solidarity movement, such asÃ‚Â American Muslims for Palestine (AMP),Ã‚Â Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Palestine Legal. They provide funding, trainings, legal assistance and other kinds of support. Independent donors and foundations also supported campus anti-Israel groups, including Resist, Inc, and the Emergent Fund.Ã‚Â 

Policy Recommendations

Administrators must respond immediately to conduct that deprives students of equal access to educational opportunities in violation of Title VI.

University leaders must ensure that students and faculty are aware of their campusesÃ¢Â€Â™ codes of conduct, including policies and procedures for managing protests, demonstrations, postings and other speech activity.
Universities must ensure free and full access to all campus buildings, spaces, events, and activities, both in policy and in effect.
Colleges and universities must make clear that calling for schools to sever ties with Hillel and Chabad are antisemitic demands, antithetical to the institutionÃ¢Â€Â™s values and will not be accommodated or considered.
Colleges and universities must reaffirm their opposition to the BDS movement and explain to the campus community why that movement is harmful and antithetical to campus values and the principle of academic freedom.

Additionally, ADL is urging Congress to pass the following federal measures to protect Jewish students and fight the scourge of antisemitism:Ã‚Â the Countering Antisemitism Act; the Antisemitism Awareness Act and the Protecting Students on Campus Act.

Finally, ADLÃ‚Â strongly urges all states to develop and implement comprehensive, state-specific strategies to counter antisemitism, with a special focus on protecting Jewish students on college and university campuses. This includes convening university leaders to discuss campus safety and issue guidance reaffirming the limits of First Amendment protection for expressive activity and how campus rules, standards, policies, and faculty responsibilities must be enforced to ensure campus safety and support Jewish students and faculty.Ã‚Â 

Methodology

ADL researchers gathered incidents primarily using open-source research methods. Much of the data was compiled by monitoring publicly available information posted online. Other information came from incidents reported to ADL by students and faculty, and by reviewing student newspapers and other news media. Important insights were also gleaned from the work of other organizations, including the Israel on Campus Coalition (ICC), Hillel International and AMCHA Initiative. In cases where ADL obtained information from the media or from third parties, researchers always sought out primary sources to substantiate the reporting.Ã‚Â 

The report does not distinguish between antisemitic anti-Israel incidents and general anti-Israel incidents (more information about antisemitic incidents specifically can be found in the annualÃ‚Â ADL Audit of Antisemitic Incidents). Some incidents crossed the line from extreme anti-Israel rhetoric into antisemitism, though others did not.

Unlike reports in previous years, ADL did not tabulate the number of incidents involving sign-on statements, letters, petitions or general anti-Israel events like panels and webinars. The volume of these incidents was so high, their tabulation was removed from the scope of the report for practical reasons.

Due to the nature of incident reporting and data collection, incidents in this report are inherently undercounted.

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is Ã¢Â€Âœto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.Ã¢Â€Â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/murder-dallas-police-officer-marks-latest-string-violent-sovereign-citizen,"The murder of a police officer in Dallas last month by a suspected adherent of the sovereign citizen movement became the latest in an alarming rise of violent incidents this year involving individuals who subscribe to the extreme right-wing, anti-government ideology and law enforcement officials.

In fact, 2024 has been a record year for violent encounters between police and sovereign citizens. In the space of just six months between March and August 2024, sovereign citizens opened fire on police officers in five separate incidents, while in a sixth incident, police had to shoot an armed sovereign citizen after he tried to break his way into an airport and threatened them.

The latest confrontation occurred on the evening of August 29, 2024, as Dallas police officer Darron Burks was sitting in his police cruiser, waiting for his next call. He was approached by a man later identified as Corey Cobb-Bey, 30, who had parked his own vehicle nearby. After a brief discussion, Cobb-Bey suddenlyÃ‚Â pulled out a pistol and shot Burks at point-blank range in his patrol car, killing him.

Cobb-Bey then armed himself with a shotgun from his vehicle and waited for police to respond to the shooting. When additional officers arrived at the scene, Cobb-Bey fired on them as well, wounding two more officers, one critically, before finally fleeing in his vehicle with police in pursuit. After a chase of 20 miles, Cobb-Bey finally stopped.Ã‚Â  As law enforcement officers exited their vehicles, Cobb-Bey emerged from his own vehicle carrying his shotgun, which he pointed at the police. Multiple officers fired at Cobb-Bey, killing him. Dallas police subsequentlyÃ‚Â characterized the killing of Burks as an Ã¢Â€ÂœambushÃ¢Â€Â and an Ã¢Â€Âœexecution.Ã¢Â€Â

An investigation of the killer by the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) revealed that Cobb-Bey had made filings and numerous online posts indicating his adherence to the anti-government extremistÃ‚Â sovereign citizen movement, as well as to the religious sect Moorish Science Temple, which hasÃ‚Â considerable overlap with sovereign citizens.

The exact motive for Cobb-BeyÃ¢Â€Â™s murder of Officer Burks is unclear, but theÃ‚Â extreme anti-government beliefs of the sovereign citizen movement can greatly heighten any antagonism adherents may have for law enforcement.

Since 2020, the sovereign citizen movement has enjoyed aÃ‚Â significant surge of popularity, capitalizing on opposition to government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak and on success in recruiting from among the more fanatic MAGA supporters and from the conspiracy movement QAnon, as well as its ability to use social media to spread its anti-government message.Ã‚Â The chances that law enforcement officers might unexpectedly encounter a potentially violent sovereign citizen in the course of their duties has correspondingly grown as well.

Notably, five of the six incidents this year took place in Florida or Texas, two populous states with a large and longstanding sovereign citizen presence.

In addition to the Dallas shooting, the five other incidents so far in 2024 included the following:

Melbourne, Florida, June 28, 2024: A sovereign citizen, John Jay Niebuhr,Ã‚Â attempted to drive his vehicle through a secure gate on the perimeter of the Melbourne Orlando International Airport. Police reported that when responding officers made contact with Niebuhr, the sovereign Ã¢Â€Â” who was armed Ã¢Â€Â” threatened the officers with a weapon, prompting them to fire at him, mortally wounding him. Prior to this incident, the Palm Bay Police Department had distributed a Ã¢Â€Âœsituational awareness bulletinÃ¢Â€Â about Niebuhr to its officers that described his previous encounters with police and his claim to be a sovereign citizen.
Hamilton County, Florida, May 15, 2024:Ã‚Â During an armed standoff,Ã‚Â self-described sovereign citizen Joseph A. Ogle opened fire on deputies from three sheriffÃ¢Â€Â™s departments attempting to serve an arrest warrant on him at his home on charges related to alleged violent threats. According to law enforcement, Ogle refused to exit his home andÃ‚Â eventually started firing at deputies and their vehicles. Ogle did eventually leave his home, carrying a handgun, at which point he was fatally shot by a SWAT team member from Alachua County.
Lakeland, Florida, April 27, 2024: Kyran Caples,Ã‚Â also known as Kmac El Bey,Ã‚Â opened fire on deputies who encountered him parked in his car at night in a closed city park.Ã‚Â According to police, Caples refused to engage or cooperate with the initial deputy who encountered him. More deputies arrived after the first one called for backup; together, they tried to remove Caples from the vehicle. Caples allegedly pulled out a gun and fired at the deputies, wounding two of them, one critically.Ã‚Â  The deputies killed Caples in return fire. Police say Caples was a sovereign citizen and had several guns in his vehicle at the time of the encounter.Ã‚Â 
Harris County, Texas, April 14, 2024: During a routine traffic stop, Harris County sheriffÃ¢Â€Â™s deputies encountered Patrick Hurst,Ã‚Â a self-declared sovereign citizen. Hurst refused to cooperate with the traffic stop, ignoring requests to leave the vehicle.Ã‚Â  After an hour, HurstÃ¢Â€Â”who already had a felony warrant for evading policeÃ¢Â€Â”simply drove off, with the deputies in pursuit. Shortly thereafter, a deputy performed a PIT maneuver to stop HurstÃ¢Â€Â™s car, upon which Hurst exited with a firearm and fired at deputies on the scene. Deputies returned fire, killing him. One of the bullets fired in the firefight wounded a bystander getting groceries.
Memphis, Tennessee, March 8, 2024:Ã‚Â Self-described sovereign citizen Geronimo Kee allegedlyÃ‚Â opened fire on a Memphis police officer during a traffic stop. The officer, who was wounded in the encounter but survived, had pulled Kee over for speeding. According to law enforcement, Kee was uncooperative and refused to sign the citation Ã¢Â€Â” as is typical for sovereign citizens. After spending considerable time trying to persuade Kee, the officer broke the driverÃ¢Â€Â™s window to open the door, at which point Kee fired at the officer, hitting him several times. Kee fled the scene in his vehicle, later abandoning it, but was soon tracked down and arrested, charged with attempted first-degree murder, employing a firearm during a dangerous felony, intentionally evading arrest in a vehicle and speeding. During his first court appearance, Kee made the common sovereign citizen claim that the court had no jurisdiction over him because it was an admiralty or maritime court.

According to COE statistics, there have been at least 31 incidents in the U.S. over the past 15 years (2010-2024) in which sovereign citizens have shot at law enforcement officers or law enforcement officers have had to shoot at sovereigns who posed some sort of threat.

The six incidents that occurred in 2024 doubled the previous yearly high of three Ã¢Â€Â” and 2024 still has four months to go before it is over.

These statistics illustrate both the considerable threat of violence that sovereign citizens pose to law enforcement as well as the growth of the movement itself in recent years.",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.5}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/slippery-slope-divestment-campaigns,"LetÃ¢Â€Â™s say that a university decides to acquiesce to the demands of anti-Israel protestors and divest its endowment from companies with business ties to Israel.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

ItÃ¢Â€Â™s a plausible scenario, despite the many political, economic, and legal reasons to reject the idea: its unfair singling-out and demonization of Israel; the likelihood of reduced endowment returns and lower donations from alumni; state measures discouraging boycotts of Israel; and potential legal risk from skirting fiduciary responsibilities, just to name a few.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Nevertheless, some universities, including Brown, UC Riverside, The New School, and Johns Hopkins have agreed to consider and vote on measures to divest their endowments from Israel. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s certainly possible that others will follow suit.
Ã‚Â 

However, any school that goes this route can easily find that itÃ¢Â€Â™s a slippery slope.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Certainly, no country is above critique, including Israel, just as no individual, company, or industry is perfect. But allowing political pressures to influence investment decisions for university endowments in the case of Israel invites similar pressure campaigns focused on any number of issues, and a wider array of investment vehicles, not just direct holdings.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Potentially Widening Divestment Targets
Ã‚Â 

Activists could demand divestment from a much wider range of companies, such as fast-food corporations that contribute to obesity through unhealthy products, technology firms accused of privacy violations or spreading misinformation, or clothing retailers that source from factories with substandard labor practices. Adopting divestment as a primary tool to address corporate imperfections risks leaving the endowment's equity portfolio with a significantly limited number of stocks, adversely impacting diversification, returns, and the institution's ability to support its goals.
Ã‚Â 

Instead of full divestment, a university may decide to appease protestorsÃ¢Â€Â™ demands in a way that would minimize impact on endowment returns: by divesting from Israel only its relatively minor direct holdings, rather than mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For example, only 4% of BrownÃ¢Â€Â™s endowment is directly invested, with 96% managed externally. However, this too is a slippery slope, since divesting from direct holdings will likely only satisfy activists temporarily.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

In fact, many divestment campaigns call for a review of ""pooled investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and ETFsÃ¢Â€Â for divestment. Any limited form of divestment is unlikely to appease activists for long and will inevitably lead to escalating demands.


Gary Sernowitz, managing director of Lime Rock Management, a private equity firm, argued in a New York Times essay that while endowments should not pursue returns at any cost they Ã¢Â€ÂœcanÃ¢Â€Â™t be in the moral adjudication business.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœColleges should debate deep moral issues and discuss the hard compromises to solve the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s ills,Ã¢Â€Â Sernowitz wrote. Ã¢Â€ÂœBut we should move those efforts to the lecture halls, away from the investment offices.Ã¢Â€Â
Ã‚Â 

In addition to this suggestion to restrict political debate to academic settings, there is at least one other alternative to acquiescing to divestment demands. Universities and their endowment managers can engage as active shareholders to promote positive change at the companies in which they invest. That would allow them to represent the values and pursue the social ends to which they are committed while protecting their endowments from the slippery slope of successive divestment campaigns.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/summer-hate-white-supremacist-activity-memorial-labor-day,"From Memorial Day through Labor Day 2024, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) tracked a sustained, high level of white supremacist activity that included paramilitary-style marches, demonstrations, Ã¢Â€Âœfight nights,Ã¢Â€Â propaganda drives, and disruption of public forums across the country.

COE documentedÃ‚Â 64 white supremacist events across 25 states between May 27 and September 2, 2024. A majority of these events were small, with just five to 12 participants, but there were also larger gatherings including one demonstration of roughly 200 participants.

In 2024 and throughout the summer, white supremacists also continued to distribute propaganda material in the form of banners, fliers, graffiti and stickers. This propaganda was primarily antisemitic, anti-Zionist and anti-immigrant, with a spike in anti-LGBTQ+ activity and messaging during Pride month in June.

These activity patterns demonstrate how white supremacists continue to opportunistically exploit current issues to raise their visibility, whether by inserting themselves into the anti-immigration debate in the lead-up to the 2024 election, targeting the LGBTQ+ community during Pride month, or adopting anti-Zionist messaging in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza following the October 7 attack.

Such efforts allow the white supremacist movement to further its goals; recruit new members, fundraise, harass and intimidate minority communities and normalize racist, antisemitic, anti-immigrant, and anti-LGBTQ+ hate.

The following is a glimpse into some of the activities and rhetoric over the past few months.

Demonstrations, Marches, and Fights

Patriot Front held more public demonstrations over the summer than any other white supremacist group. Summer has been a particularly active time for Patriot Front since it often chooses significant American holidays like Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and Labor Day to hold larger demonstrations for higher visibility. Patriot FrontÃ¢Â€Â™s Independence Day march, held in downtown Nashville, drew approximately 200 participants and was the largest white supremacist event of the summer.

The group also held several medium-size flash demonstrations over the Memorial Day and Labor Day holiday weekends, including in Texas, Washington, Colorado, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. Many of these demonstrations took place at cemeteries or memorials with a connection to American history, such as the Gettysburg National Military Park.

Over the Labor Day holiday weekend, approximately 30 individuals associated with Patriot Front held a demonstration in downtown Tallahassee, FL.

The neo-Nazi groupÃ‚Â Blood Tribe also held several events this summer wearing their now-signature black ski masks and red outfits, carrying swastika flags and sometimes even firearms during militant marches through Pierre, South Dakota; Springfield, Ohio; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

During the June march in Pierre,Ã‚Â Chris Pohlhaus, the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s leader, stated that they were there to protest South DakotaÃ¢Â€Â™s HB 1076, a state bill signed into law in March that includes a definition of antisemitism in investigations of unfair or discriminatory practices.

White supremacist groups also continued to hostÃ‚Â collaborative fight nights and MMA-style events over the summer. These events attracted a range of white supremacist groups from across the United States and allowed them to fraternize, recruit and fundraise.

The largest fighting events occurred in August. Over the weekend of August 9, individuals affiliated with Patriot Front andÃ‚Â the Active Club network took part in a Jiu-Jitsu tournament organized by Ã¢Â€ÂœDevotion Jiu-Jitsu,Ã¢Â€Â a Virginia-based gym closely connected to the white supremacist group Wolves of Vinland (WoV). Later in the month, on August 24, SoCal Active Club, a southern California-based white supremacist group, organized its third annual Ã¢Â€ÂœFrontierÃ¢Â€Â fight night in Hemet, California. The event attracted approximately 50 white supremacists, including members of Patriot Front and regional Active Clubs from Massachusetts, Idaho, Michigan, Wyoming, Texas and Arizona. Individuals affiliated with theÃ‚Â Western Hammerskins, a historically violent neo-Nazi skinhead group, were also in attendance.

Antisemitic Activity

Over the summer, white supremacists distributed antisemitic propaganda and held events that targeted the Jewish community.

From July 13 - 21, approximately two dozen individuals associated with the antisemiticÃ‚Â Goyim Defense League (GDL) gathered in Nashville, Tennessee, to participate in the networkÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€ÂœName the NoseÃ¢Â€Â tour, its sixth since launching the event in 2019. Participants included individuals from Florida, Georgia, Colorado, California, Oklahoma, Missouri, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Texas and even drew some from Canada. The group engaged in antisemitic trolling tactics including overpass banner drops, propaganda distributions and demonstrations that displayed antisemitic banners and swastika flags.

During the tour, the group also disrupted a city council meeting, protested outside a synagogue and disrupted Ã¢Â€ÂœNashville Together,Ã¢Â€Â a Jewish solidarity event.

Ã‚Â 

In both July and August, GDL associate Shane Powell organized Ã¢Â€ÂœFlyerCaustÃ¢Â€Â events in California during which he and several other individuals associated with the GDL andÃ‚Â Clockwork Crew livestreamed overpass demonstrations and the distribution of thousands of antisemitic fliers in the surrounding cities of the greater San Francisco area from Petaluma to Berkeley Hills.

Patriot Front, which has been responsible for the vast majority of white supremacist propaganda distributions since 2018, continued its use of the antisemitic message Ã¢Â€ÂœNo Zionists in government, we serve one NationÃ¢Â€Â in banners and fliers.

Individuals associated with various white supremacist networks also distributed some of the anti-Zionist propaganda and messaging seen since the October 7 attack, as well as antisemitic tropes. Some of their material read: Ã¢Â€ÂœNo more wars for Israel, End Jewish terror,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœResist Zionism,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœAnti-Zionist action,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœBoycott Jewish businesses,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœBoycott Israeli businessÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœJews & The AIPAC Lobby Control Congress & The Senate, Wake Up.""

Anti-Immigration Activity

Since late May 2024, COE tracked an increased focus on anti-immigrant themes in white supremacist propaganda and rhetoric. Opposition to non-white immigration is core to white supremacist ideology and extremists rush to exploit the ongoing immigration crisis.

White supremacists held demonstrations at locations where these groups allege immigrants are being housed or in cities perceived as welcoming to them.

On June 2, individuals associated with the Atlantic Nationalist Club, a small white supremacist group primarily based in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York, demonstrated outside a Farmingdale, New York Motor Inn claiming immigrants were being held there. The group held a banner that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo migrants in N.Y.Ã¢Â€Â A few weeks later, on June 15, individuals associated with a Washington-based chapter of white supremacist White Lives Matter (WLM) network held an anti-immigrant demonstration outside a refugee encampment in Kent, Washington. Members held a large sign that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœAuslÃƒÂ¤nder Raus!Ã¢Â€Â, a German phrase meaning Ã¢Â€Âœforeigners out.Ã¢Â€Â

In August, Blood Tribe turned its focus on the Haitian immigrant population in Springfield, Ohio, and encouraged other white supremacist groups to do the same. On August 10, twelve Blood Tribe members marched through the city, with several participants waving swastika flags while others carried AR-style rifles and knives. During a stop in front of City Hall, Blood Tribe Ohio leader Drake Berentz gave a speech complaining about Ã¢Â€Âœnon-white immigrantsÃ¢Â€Â in the United States.

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Berentz and four other Blood Tribe members returned on August 27 to attend the Springfield City Commission meeting. During the public comment portion of the meeting, Berentz, griped about the cityÃ¢Â€Â™s immigrant population, speaking for less than two minutes before being escorted out of the building by police officers.

On September 1, approximately two dozen individuals associated with Patriot Front followed Blood TribeÃ¢Â€Â™s lead and held an anti-immigration rally outside Springfield City Hall displaying a banner that read, Ã¢Â€ÂœAmerican spirit, European blood.Ã¢Â€Â

Blood TribeÃ¢Â€Â™s final march of the summer also focused on immigration. On August 24, approximately two dozen members of Blood Tribe marched through Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, waving swastika flags and shouting the Ã¢Â€ÂœSieg Heil!Ã¢Â€Â while engaging in verbal and physical altercations with pedestrians. The march ended on the state capitolÃ¢Â€Â™s steps where brief speeches were given that attributed high crime rates to the Ã¢Â€Âœnon-whiteÃ¢Â€Â and immigrant population of the city.","[1, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.6, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/impact-divestment-campaigns-rising-antisemitism,"Campus activism surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict often presents a skewed narrative, painting Israel as the sole aggressor and magnifying its flaws beyond those of any other nation. While all countries have their shortcomings and deserve scrutiny, Israel stands out as a unique target of widespread university divestment campaigns, suggesting a disproportionate focus on its actions and policies.

Through their rhetoric and demands, anti-Israel divestment campaigns can feed into the demonization of Israel and mischaracterization of Zionism, the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland. The measures for which Israel-divestment activists advocate are one-sided and unconstructive, and they fail to promote a better future for Palestinians and Israelis.
Ã‚Â 

Anti-Zionism and BDS

Ã‚Â 

Listen to the slogans and demands of anti-Israel activists, and their beliefs about Israel and Zionism become clear. Divestment campaigns intend to delegitimize Israel's right to exist and unfairly attempt to hold Israel to a different standard than any other country, including the United States. And yet they fail to condemn the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s worst sponsors of terror and abusers of human rights.


The movement places the entire onus for the complicated Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Israel alone, and does not support constructive measures to build Israeli-Palestinian engagement or a mutually negotiated two-state solution to the conflict. Indeed, the movement for divestment doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t seek a two-state solution; it aims to dismantle the Jewish state.Ã‚Â 


Israel-divestment activism is the latest iteration of the wider Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement that has attempted for years to marginalize and delegitimize Israel. BDS opposes the fundamental building blocks for Israeli-Palestinian understanding, peace-building, and ultimate reconciliation, even at the grassroots level.Ã‚Â 


ADL believes that many of the founding goals of the BDS movement are antisemitic, given that they effectively reject or ignore the Jewish peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s right of self-determination Ã¢Â€Â“ and if implemented, would result in the eradication of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s only Jewish state. And some BDS advocates and campaigns engage in antisemitic rhetoric.Ã‚Â 

BDS campaigns can create tensions in communities, particularly on college campuses, potentially leading to the isolation and intimidation of Jewish students and supporters of Israel. The movementÃ¢Â€Â™s regressive policy of Ã¢Â€Âœanti-normalizationÃ¢Â€Â forbids people-to-people exchanges, dialogue opportunities for Israelis and Palestinians, or even interactions between Ã¢Â€Âœpro-IsraelÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœpro-PalestineÃ¢Â€Â groups and advocates. This applies even to Israeli/pro-Israel groups who support a Gaza ceasefire and are strong advocates for Palestinian rights unless the parties involved first renounce Zionism and declare Israelis to be Ã¢Â€ÂœoppressorsÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœcolonizers.Ã¢Â€Â

Rising AntisemitismÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The demonization of Zionism and Zionists is particularly frightening and dangerous in this moment of significantly rising levels of antisemitism, and can contribute to conditions where Jews are targeted for their actual or perceived connection to Israel. And it is not just hypothetical: during the Fall semester (from October 7 to the end of 2023), ADL documented a 1,062 percent increase in antisemitic incidents on U.S. university campuses, compared to the same period in 2022.Ã‚Â 

A U.S. News & World Report survey in April and May found that more than two-thirds of Jewish students at elite U.S. universities say antisemitism is a problem on their campus. Students from universities across the country articulated the plight of many Jewish university students at a House hearing in March. One student at Rutgers University stated Ã¢Â€ÂœI didnÃ¢Â€Â™t come to college to study in a living laboratory of antisemitism, which is what it has become,Ã¢Â€Â adding Ã¢Â€ÂœJews at Rutgers are afraid.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Another student at University of California, Berkeley faced physical and verbal harassment, eventually missing class due to fear of violence. Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen you do not call out hate against Jews based on shared ancestral identity, that sends the message to other students on campus that it is okay, socially acceptable, tolerated behavior to actively hate Jews on campus,Ã¢Â€Â she said.

Ã‚Â 

Effective ActivismÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

If campus activists were genuinely committed to uplifting the Palestinian people and helping bring lasting peace to the region, there are more productive avenues than pushing divestment from Israel. Activists could be advocating for their university endowments to become activist shareholders in the companies in which they invest, using their leverage to push those companies to make strategic investments in the Palestinian economy and in peacebuilding initiatives.Ã‚Â 

But that is not what is happening. Anti-Israel activistsÃ¢Â€Â™ current approach seems focused on penalizing only one side in a complex, two-sided conflict, placing the entire burden on Israel to create the necessary conditions for peace. This one-sided strategy fails to acknowledge the roles and responsibilities of both parties in resolving the conflict and achieving lasting stability in the region.Ã‚Â

Menlo Park, CA 94025


Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,


We write to you as leaders of seven of the largest Jewish Diaspora communities representing over 90% of Jews globally outside of Israel. As Jews, our communities continue to feel the impact of the brutal Hamas attack of October 7, 2023, with its death toll of over 1200 Israelis, over 4000 wounded, and over 250 taken hostage, and over a hundred still held captive in Gaza. Our Jewish communities continue to bear the brunt of dramatic increases of antisemitism, with huge number of attacks on our community members, our students, our institutions, both on the streets and online. Alarmingly, the Oversight Board (OB) released its September 4, 2024 decision that the phrase Ã¢Â€Âœfrom the river to the seaÃ¢Â€Â is not hate. We are profoundly dismayed at the Oversight BoardÃ¢Â€Â™s decision, and we urge Meta to reject it and amend its hate policy to prohibit this phrase that effectively calls for the expulsion of half of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s Jews.


We fear that acceptance of this decision would represent an indifference to online hate and harassment. Regrettably, this has been a pattern in Meta. From the decade it took Meta to realize that Holocaust denial is indeed hate, to your well-documented role in the Genocide of the Rohingya Muslim community, to the ongoing failure to address hate against the LGBTQ community that has led to severe offline harms, to your role in fomenting movements rooted in conspiracy theories like Qanon that ultimately lead to the January 6 insurrection against the United States government, Meta has sadly made itself a haven for radicalization and extreme ideologies in the pursuit of profit.


The phrase Ã¢Â€Âœfrom the river to the seaÃ¢Â€Â is hate speech. This rallying cry, enshrined in the charter of Hamas, has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas and the PFLP, which seek IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s destruction through violent means. It is fundamentally a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the entirety of the State of Israel, which would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state. It is an antisemitic charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination, including through the forced removal of Jews from their ancestral homeland. Indeed, the Arabic version of the slogan is Ã¢Â€Â˜From the water to the water, Palestine will be ArabÃ¢Â€Â™ (min el-mayeh lil-mayeh, Filastin Arabiyeh), making the meaning crystal clear: there is no space for Jews.


Usage of this phrase has the effect of making members of the Jewish and pro-Israel community feel unsafe and ostracized. A recent study of the American campus environment from the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago (CPOST) found that Ã¢Â€Âœ66% of Jewish college students understand the pro-Palestinian protest chant Ã¢Â€ÂœFrom the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be FreeÃ¢Â€Â to mean the expulsion and genocide of Israeli Jews.Ã¢Â€Â


Understanding that Ã¢Â€Âœzero tolerance does not mean zero occurrence,Ã¢Â€Â accepting the Oversight BoardÃ¢Â€Â™s decision on this case will clearly indicate MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s willingness to tolerate violent hate speech on its platform. Moreover, the focus on the intent of the speaker over the impact of the speech in this decision shows a callous disregard for the experience of marginalized communities.


As the leaders of communities representing the largest Diaspora Jewish populations, we call on Meta to recognize the harm this phrase poses to the Jewish community worldwide, reject the Oversight BoardÃ¢Â€Â™s short-sighted decision and urge it instead to take steps to address the ongoing issues with online hate and harassment that continue to proliferate across MetaÃ¢Â€Â™s many platforms.

The United States: ADL (Anti-Defamation League) and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.0, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/legal-risks-divestment-israel-university-endowments,"There are many reasons why itÃ¢Â€Â™s a bad idea for university endowments to divest from Israel. Divestment serves to delegitimize Israel and puts the onus for solving the longstanding Palestinian-Israeli conflict on only one side. It could also likely lead to economic ramifications, such as reduced alumni giving and lower returns, as well as open up the potential for heavier taxation of endowment income.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Beyond all of these arguments, universities that decide to divest from Israel could face more concrete obstacles to following through on it: They may be in breach of their fiduciary duties and even face legal risk in some states.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Fiduciary BreachÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 
University endowments generally have a professionally staffed Investment Office and an Investment Committee. The Investment Office is responsible for analyzing and proposing investment strategies, as well as eventually implementing those strategies. The Investment Committee is responsible for reviewing asset allocation policies, endowment performance, and strategy proposals and has ultimate oversight over investment decisions. Investment Committee members are usually individuals with investment expertise and some members may also be trustees of the university.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Among the fiduciary obligations of Investment Committees is a legal responsibility for duties of care, loyalty, good faith, confidentiality, prudence and disclosure when serving the best financial interests of the university through managing the endowment investment.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Divesting from Israel Ã¢Â€Âœwould be a breach of fiduciary obligation that could expose trustees to personal liability"" for not prioritizing the financial health and efficiency of the endowment portfolio, Max M. Schanzenbach, a professor at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law and an expert on fiduciary law, wrote in the Wall Street Journal.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA), enacted in 49 states (all but Pennsylvania), governs the management of institutional funds donated to charitable institutions. It was enacted to protect the assets of nonprofit institutions from misuse and loss.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Among other things, UPMIFA provides guidance to those responsible for investment decision-making on behalf of nonprofit institutions, which includes most private and public colleges and universities. Nonprofits are encouraged to adopt spending policies that are not only aligned with donor intent but also flexible enough to accommodate economic changes, thereby preserving an endowment's principal over time.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Under UPMIFA, voting to divest a universityÃ¢Â€Â™s endowment from Israel could be deemed imprudent, as it is politically motivated rather than based on sound investment decisions and a decision made without adequate economic analysis. Violators of UPMIFA can face legal challenges, monetary penalties, or even loss of nonprofit status.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

State LawsÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Campus demands for Israel divestment stem from the longstanding anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Among U.S. states, there is broad bipartisan consensus opposed to BDS, with 38 states taking some actionÃ¢Â€Â“laws, resolutions, and/or executive ordersÃ¢Â€Â“to discourage BDS activities.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

State attorneys general could therefore take legal action against universities pursuing divestment from Israel, potentially leading to costly lawsuits and further legal complications.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

In some states, laws prohibit state entities from contracting with businesses or other entities that boycott IsraelÃ¢Â€Â“meaning that universities that engage in the BDS movement could be jeopardizing existing state contracts and/or putting at risk other forms of state financial support of their institution.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

ItÃ¢Â€Â™s important to note that these concerns extend to private universities in addition to public ones. Private universities may very well have contracts with state entities and/or receive financial support from the state (such as research grants or for student financial aid programs), all of which could be in jeopardy. And UPMIFA requirements apply if the university operates as a nonprofit organization or its endowment is used for charitable purposes Ã¢Â€Â“ which is the legal structure of nearly all universities.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

University trustees and Investment Committee members who disregard the legal and fiduciary responsibilities associated with Israel divestment expose themselves and their institutions to significant risk.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/hamas-execution-6-hostages-leaves-us-agony-and-yet-more-aligned-ever,"I landed in Israel on Monday today with a heavy heart. The news of HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ execution of six hostages has cast a long, mournful shadow over Israel, on the entire Jewish people and on humanity itself. It is a dark time.

Funerals already have taken place for Ori Danino zÃ¢Â€Âl, Carmel Gat zÃ¢Â€Âl, Hersh Goldberg-Polin zÃ¢Â€Âl, Alex Lubnov zÃ¢Â€Âl, Almog Sarusi zÃ¢Â€Âl and Edan Yerushalmi zÃ¢Â€Âl. For nearly eleven months, their families have displayed extraordinary grace and tremendous strength in the face of the unthinkable. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™ve done so again in the past few days as they bid farewell to their loved ones who were stolen from them and from all of us. Indeed, if you can watch the remarks of Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin at HershÃ¢Â€Â™s funeral, it is worth the time. Their words are among the most agonizing and yet inspiring talks that you will ever hear.

This week, thousands of people will visit these six families to offer comfort and support as they sit shiva. I will do my best to represent all of you in these visits.

I paid a shiva call yesterday and visited with HershÃ¢Â€Â™s parents. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t at their home but in a large tent the Jerusalem municipality built to accommodate all the people. There were nearly 100 people in line, waiting to see them. It was so, so emotional and hard. Rachel and Jon are amazing, incredibly strong people.

Wednesday, I visited the site of the Nova festival on Kibbutz Reim. Although I know the stories, have met survivors, being there was truly harrowing. The pain absolutely seizes you as you take in the scale of the horror. It feels like a sacred space and yet it exudes a stillness. The site has evolved into a massive memorial with makeshift altars paying tribute to the 346 victims.

Finally, my soul suffered as I sat with hostage families and rescued hostages this evening in Tel Aviv, listening to their stories, each more harrowing than the next.

Their pain is unimaginable. There are no words. As one of them told me, ""It is simply beyond.""

As we pause and mourn those we have lost, we cannot rest. We must work through our grief and push forward for the sake of the 101 hostages who remain captive in Gaza. We owe it to them and to our own children who, one day, will ask how we led in this moment and learn from our example.

I spend my days fighting antisemitism, not prosecuting military conflict, but I am more convinced than ever that we will not bring the hostages home without a deal.

This is why the Israeli government, with the support of the US, must do absolutely everything it can, even making painful concessions, to reach an agreement. This is why Egypt, Qatar and Turkey must apply intense pressure on Hamas to free these innocent people Ã¢Â€Â” boys and girls, men and women, parents and grandparents Ã¢Â€Â” who are being starved and tortured in tunnels under Gaza. Hamas leaders sipping coffee and luxuriating in Doha need to start to feel severe consequences so the hostages are released immediately.

There is no excuse, no rationale, for this depravity to continue.

We must also demand that the US government and that the entire world community hold Hamas accountable for its grotesque, unprovoked attack on Israel; for the seizure and torture of 250 people including Israelis, Americans and others; for the devastating consequences that the war has wrought on the Jewish state; and for the catastrophic damage done to the people of Gaza. We welcome the US Justice DepartmentÃ¢Â€Â™s indictments this week against Hamas leaders, but more needs to come. Hamas is a vicious organization that openly calls for genocide and acts on these evil plans. They have violated the most basic norms of our society. Like al Qaeda, ISIS and other terror organizations, it must be eradicated. Its patrons in Tehran who encourage their barbarism must be stopped. It will not be simple. Far from it. But there is no alternative.

Finally, we must make it 100% clear that we will never tolerate Jews Ã¢Â€Â“ in Israel, America or anywhere else on Earth Ã¢Â€Â“ being marginalized, threatened or violated just because of who we are. Marching and masking with the intent to harass and intimidate isnÃ¢Â€Â™t freedom of assembly. Inciting violence isnÃ¢Â€Â™t freedom of speech. These are criminal acts, and we will demand that the culprits who commit them are held accountable.

Whether on college campuses, in private spaces or in public places, it is long overdue for leaders at all levels to lead and to deter such shameful behavior with clear and consistent consequences. As long as ADL exists, hate against Jews or anyone else will never have safe harbor. We will be relentless. We will never give up the fight.

Again, these are difficult days. I share the anguish and heartbreak that so many of you feel. But, above all, as Jon Polin said at HershÃ¢Â€Â™s funeral, citing IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s national anthem, we must remember that Od Lo Avda Tikvateinu Ã¢Â€Â” our hope is not lost.

May their memories forever be a blessing. #BringThemHome

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/free-legal-protection-helpline-college-students-received-requests,"September 3, 2024 ... Hillel International, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP today announced that the Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL) has received more than 650 requests for assistance from university students across the country who experienced antisemitic harassment, violence or discrimination in the first nine months of the program.

Through CALL, lawyers from leading firms provide free assistance to students reporting antisemitic discrimination and hate by conducting in-depth information-gathering interviews and offering pro bono representation in cases of violations of studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ civil rights under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Since CALLÃ¢Â€Â™s launch, nearly 100 attorneys from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and 40 other law firms fielded studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ requests for help. More than 250 individual practitioners also volunteered their time to support Jewish students.

Examples of CALLÃ¢Â€Â™s work on behalf of students include:

Providing legal support to a Jewish student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who was verbally harassed and physically assaulted because he was supportive of Israel and the hostages taken in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7.
After Jewish students attending The Ohio State University were assaulted, CALL worked with Jewish partner organizations to file a Title VI complaint.
As a result of a CALL intake, ADL and the Brandeis Center filed a Title VI complaint alleging the Pomona CollegeÃ‚Â administration failed to protect Jewish students as anti-Israel organizations held on-campus protests in violation of college regulationsÃ‚Â  that resulted in physical violence, intimidation, and occupation of campus buildings.
CALL drafted a letter to Princeton University leadership condemning the use of no-contact orders to silence a Jewish student journalist trying to report on anti-Israel protests. This led Princeton to change its policy so that these no-contact orders could no longer be issued under such circumstances and affirmed that the student would not face consequences for her journalism.

Ã¢Â€ÂœAs antisemitism on campus skyrockets, CALL is making a difference in the lives of Jewish students every day by providing outstanding legal support to fight harassment andÃ‚Â  bigotry,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. Ã¢Â€ÂœCALL empowers students to take action and push back against those who perpetrate and enable hate on their campus.Ã¢Â€Â

So far, CALL has received a wide variety of antisemitic incident reports including physical assaults; in-person and online harassment; exclusion from student organizations and other educational opportunities on campus; harassment, discrimination, and improper political indoctrination from professors in the classroom;Ã‚Â  protestors who confront and harass Jewish and Israeli students on campus; vandalism and unauthorized removal of hostage and pro-Israel posters on campus; disruptions of regular classroom instruction and events sponsored by Jewish and pro-Israel organizations; and retaliatory bad faith complaints filed against Jewish students through universitiesÃ¢Â€Â™ internal grievance processes.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe know that addressing the scourge of antisemitism requires a multifaceted approach, and I am proud of the critical role that the Campus Antisemitism Legal Line has played during the past year,Ã¢Â€Â said Adam Lehman, president and CEO of Hillel International. Ã¢Â€ÂœAs a complement to our broader work supporting Jewish life on campus and addressing antisemitism, CALL offers an essential tool for Jewish students to get the help they need from leading legal experts to protect their civil rights.Ã¢Â€Â

Recognizing the mounting concerns about the upcoming school year, the CALL helpline remains ready to assist and support Jewish students who face antisemitic incidents on campus.Ã‚Â Students, family members, faculty, or staff members can go to the CALL website or text Ã¢Â€ÂœCALLhelpÃ¢Â€Â to 51555 to report incidents of antisemitic discrimination, intimidation, harassment, vandalism, or violence that may necessitate legal action.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe law is a powerful motivator and an essential tool in the effort to combat antisemitism and protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination on campus,Ã¢Â€Â said Alyza D. Lewin, president of the Brandeis Center. Ã¢Â€ÂœThrough CALL, we have educated students on their legal rights, demanded universities meet their legal obligations, and perhaps most importantly, come together as a community in strength to empower and protect our students. They know that if they have the courage and confidence to wear their Jewish identity proudly, and they come under attack for that, we will have their back.Ã¢Â€Â

During the 2023-2024 academic year, colleges and universities saw more than 1,400 antisemitic incidents on campuses Ã¢Â€Â“ by far the highest number of antisemitic incidents in a single school year ever on record according to ADL and Hillel International tracking. Following the Oct. 7 attack, aÃ‚Â survey by Hillel and ADLÃ‚Â found that 73 percent of Jewish college students and 44 percent of non-Jewish students experienced or witnessed antisemitism on their campuses last fall.

""WeÃ¢Â€Â™re grateful to be part of this important effort to help victims of campus antisemitism. Gibson Dunn is committed to combating antisemitism and all forms of hate and intolerance,Ã¢Â€Â said Barbara Becker, Gibson Dunn Chair and Managing Partner.

CALLÃ¢Â€Â™s supporting organizations include Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, the American Jewish Committee, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Jewish Agency for Israel, Jewish on Campus, the Jewish Federations of North America, JGO: The Jewish Grad Organization (formerly JGSI), the Israel on Campus Coalition, the Israeli-American Council, Masa, Olami, the OU Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Delta Tau, and Zeta Beta Tau.

A separate legal helpline providing pro bono legal assistance to parents whose children are experiencing antisemitism in CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s K-12 schools is run by the Brandeis Center, ADL, and StandWithUs, along with four leading law firms. Parents and other interested adults in California can report incidents of antisemitic discrimination, intimidation, harassment, vandalism or violence occurring in K-12 schools to theÃ‚Â Legal Protection K-12 Helpline.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/alternative-germany-afd-party-what-you-need-know,"What is AfD?

Founded in 2013 as an anti-European Union party, AfD has since radicalized and become an extremist, anti-immigrant party whose aim is Ã¢Â€Âœto eliminate the free democratic basic order,Ã¢Â€Â according to a 2023 report by the German Institute for Human Rights.

AfD leaders have made antisemitic, anti-Muslim and anti-democratic statements, detailed below.

The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt fÃƒÂ¼r Verfassungsschutz or BfV), its domestic intelligence agency which monitors extremist threats to GermanyÃ¢Â€Â™s democracy, has listed AfD as an officially suspected extremist organization and classified its youth wing, Ã¢Â€ÂœYoung Alternative,Ã¢Â€Â as extremist in April 2023.Ã‚Â  The state-level BfV offices in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia have gone a step further and classified the AfD party as a whole as extremist. As a suspected extremist organization, AfD is subject to BfV intelligence collection, including the use of informants and surveillance of individuals and their communications.[1]Ã¯Â¿Â¼Ã‚Â 

Why is AfD of concern? Nazi slogans, Holocaust trivialization and more.

BjÃƒÂ¶rn HÃƒÂ¶cke, leader of the AfD party in the state of Thuringia, has twice been fined by a German court for using a banned Nazi slogan.Ã‚Â  The phrase, Ã¢Â€ÂœEverything for GermanyÃ¢Â€Â (Ã¢Â€ÂœAlles fÃƒÂ¼r DeutschlandÃ¢Â€Â) was a slogan of the Nazi stormtroopers and engraved on their daggers.

In a 2017 speech to the AfD youth wing, HÃƒÂ¶cke bemoaned GermanÃ¢Â€Â™s culture of remembrance of the Holocaust, saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe Germans, our people, are the only people in the world who planted a monument of shame in the middle of our national capital.Ã¢Â€Â He called for Germany to stop atoning for Nazi crimes and make a ""180-degree turn"" in how it remembers its past.

Alexander Gauland, an AfD co-founder, former party leader, and current Member of Parliament, has engaged in Holocaust trivialization on several occasions.Ã‚Â  In a 2018 speech to the AfD youth wing, he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœHitler and the Nazis are just a speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Gauland also said in 2017 that Germans should be Ã¢Â€Âœproud of the achievements of German soldiers in two world wars.Ã¢Â€Â

HÃƒÂ¶cke has engaged in extremist speech to the extent that a judge ruled that he could be described as a fascist without fear of a defamation suit, because such a description was a Ã¢Â€Âœvalue judgment based on facts.Ã¢Â€Â

AfD leaders have also threatened to deport German citizens of non-ethnic-German heritage.

In its 2017 election manifesto, AfD asserted that the presence of Muslims in Germany was a threat to the country: Ã¢Â€ÂœIslam does not belong in Germany. The AfD sees the spread of Islam and the presence of over 5 million Muslims, whose numbers are constantly growing, as a great danger to our state, our society and our system of values.Ã¢Â€Â[2]

AfD members were exposed as participants in a November 2023 secret meeting of far-right extremists in Potsdam, including Austrian neo-Nazi Martin Sellner, who discussed a mass deportation plan for foreigners and ""non-assimilated"" Germans, as part of AfDÃ¢Â€Â™s strategy should it be elected to govern Germany.

Following the exposure of the secret meeting, AfD politicians initially denied participating, but just weeks later began actively campaigning with the slogan, Ã¢Â€Âœremigration,Ã¢Â€Â which was the term used at the meeting for the mass deportation plan.


https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/deutschland/politik/afd-ostdeutschland-remigration-geheimtreffen-potsdam-100.html

This idea is hardly new for AfD.Ã‚Â  In 2017, AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland said that Aydan ÃƒÂ–zoguz,Ã‚Â  a Socialist Party politician, who was born in Germany to Turkish immigrant parents, should be Ã¢Â€Âœdisposed ofÃ¢Â€Â in Turkey.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â 

Current AfD leader, Alice Weidel, then co-leader with Gauland, defended GaulandÃ¢Â€Â™s statement.

Why so much concern now?

Germany has federal parliamentary elections on February 23 and AfD is polling at roughly 20%, in second place behind the Christian Democratic Union party at 30%.

In state elections in September 2024, AfD gained significantly, coming in first place in Thuringia with 33% of the vote, and a close second place in Saxony with over 30% of the vote.

As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, ADL takes no position in support of or in opposition to any candidate for elected office.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/economic-risks-divestment-israel-university-endowments,"As encampment protests riled college campuses throughout the Spring 2024 semester, some universities agreed to formally consider protestorsÃ¢Â€Â™ demands that their endowments divest from companies with business interests in Israel. It is the latest iteration of the years-long Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign that seeks to isolate Israel economically.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Brown University reached an agreement for student protestors to take down their encampment and refrain from further disrupting campus life. In exchange, the governing Corporation of Brown University will hold a formal vote on divestment in October. UC Riverside, The New School and Johns Hopkins University came to similar agreements with students. With anti-Israel divestment protests likely to gain steam again when students return to campuses at the end of summer break, other universities may very well follow this example.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

However, acquiescing to these demands carries significant economic risks that can easily have a deep negative impact on those endowments. These include lower endowment returns, reduced alumni contributions, and constrained access to capital. This trifecta of challenges, as well as additional tax-related risks, would have real-world consequences, impacting a universityÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to fund scholarships and research and to maintain its facilities.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

All of this is in addition to the many moral and legal reasons to oppose divestment. Divestment campaigns unjustly single out Israel as solely responsible for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and feed the demonization of Israel and rise of antisemitism.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

ProtestorsÃ¢Â€Â™ goals vary school by school, but many are demanding that their endowments divest from all companies with any ties to Israel. Others are seeking more limited divestment only from companies that produce weapons or have direct military ties, like Boeing. Regardless, universities that agree to divestment are likely to face significant economic ramifications.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Lower Endowment ReturnsÃ‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

We live today in a more globalized and financially interconnected world than we ever did in the pastÃ¢Â€Â“certainly more so than during the 1980s South Africa divestment movement.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

According to JLens, an ADL affiliate representing the endowments of Jewish organizations with assets totaling $10 billion, more than 100 companies from the S&P 500 conduct business in Israel. This includes some of the largest and most successful global companies, like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

More recent campus divestment movements, such as those in the 2010s focused on guns and fossil fuels, involved removing relatively small numbers of companies whose businesses directly revolved around those issues from university endowments.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Fully divesting from Israel, therefore, is not a straightforward process of selling off investments in a handful of companies. Given the sheer number of companies with economic ties to Israel and the size of some of those companies, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a stretch to predict that divestment could result in significantly lower returns and a less diversified portfolio.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Lower Alumni ContributionsÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Universities that divest from Israel, in either an expansive or more limited form, also risk alienating donors and alumni for whom a connection to Israel is core to their Jewish identity.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Already, a number of high-profile, high-net-worth donors have announced theyÃ¢Â€Â™re withdrawing support from their alma maters because of campus antisemitism and what they see as universities' inadequate responses to protect Jewish students. Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team and a major donor to Columbia University, is just one example. And the same is true for an unknown number of rank-and-file donors whose names (and net worths) do not make headlines. Jesse M. Fried, a Professor at Harvard Law School, and David H. Webber, a Boston University Law School professor, note in a Newsweek piece that the Ã¢Â€Âœfurther universities move in the direction of boycotting Israel in any respect, the further donations will fall.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Additionally, even donors who do not care deeply about the Israel issue specifically may be frustrated by universities' willingness to consider divestment demands from students who have violated school policies and fueled antisemitism on campusÃ¢Â€Â“especially since those demands can decrease the value of the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s endowment.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Reduced Access to CapitalÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

As donors increasingly withhold contributionsÃ¢Â€Â“and endowments suffer from the lower returns that divestment will bringÃ¢Â€Â“universities divesting from Israel may face reduced access to capital. This would, in turn, force them to rely more on debt financing.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Investors may also view divesting universities as higher risk, leading to lower bond prices and higher borrowing costs, making it harder for universities to finance themselves.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 
Tax Risks

Ã‚Â 

In recent years, the taxation of endowment income has become a contentious political issue, with lawmakers increasingly viewing it as a potential tool to influence university behavior. Although the idea of taxing university endowments was for decades considered off-limits, this is no longer the case. Since 2018, many private colleges and universities have been subject to a 1.4% federal excise tax on endowment income.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

More recently, some lawmakers have proposed taxing endowments even more aggressively in cases where universities fail to adequately protect students from antisemitism on campus or allow disruptive encampments. In fact, several congressional bills suggest raising the current 1.4% tax rate on endowment income to significantly higher levels, ranging from six to as much as fifty percent, depending on the circumstances and perceived infractions of the universities in question. (On the state level, too, some lawmakers have proposed levying taxes on large private university endowments, albeit for different policy reasons.)Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 
As the idea of taxing endowments becomes an increasingly politicized issue, universities that use their endowments to make political statements, such as divesting from Israel, risk exposing themselves to higher taxes on their endowment income.
Ã‚Â 

Once political considerations enter the conversation about endowment investing, universities can expect to face unintended consequences like those outlined hereÃ¢Â€Â“and, in all likelihood, others that may not even be foreseeable at this point. Avoiding this path allows endowment decisions to remain focused on providing universities the financial support they need for continued academic excellence and positive impact on the world.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

ADL publishes this piece in partnership with JLens.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-finds-many-social-media-platforms-are-not-fully-complying-newly,"Sacramento, CA. August 28, 2024Ã¢Â€Â¦ Several major social media platforms are not complying fully with either the letter or the spirit of a new California law aimed at holding them accountable for spreading hate and harassment. A newÃ‚Â reportÃ‚Â released by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society (CTS) evaluates the first rounds of transparency reporting for social media platforms as required by this first-of-its-kind law. in California with the goal of getting social media platforms to stop hiding hate.

While most tech companies have rules against hate and harassment, they have not been held accountable to the American public for enforcing them. This changed with the signing of California Assembly Bill 587, also known as the Social Media Transparency Bill, which requires social media platforms to publicly disclose their community safety guidelines and report data around hate, harassment, misinformation, disinformation, foreign interference, and the enforcement of their policies. Prior to this law taking effect, transparency reports were published voluntarily on an ad-hoc basis, were largely inconsistent and far from transparent (see ADLÃ¢Â€Â™sÃ‚Â Platform Transparency Reports Ã¢Â€Â“ Just How Transparent?).

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s report -Ã‚Â AB 587 Revisited: How are Platforms Complying with CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s Newly-Mandated Transparency Reporting?Ã¢Â€Â“ analyzed nine platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ mandated reports from January and April 2024. Though reporting has already improved from January to April, several major platforms avoided complying fully with either the letter or the spirit of the law. ADL found that Discord, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Roblox committed to addressing hate and appear to have made efforts to publish detailed, informative reports. Overall, ADL found that even with these newly produced reports, platforms do not always provide the necessary context to make sense of their numbers, putting the public at a disadvantage when making sense of these platformsÃ¢Â€Â™ efforts to quell hate online.

Given the alarming rise in hate online in recent years, ADL sponsored AB 587 from its inception in 2021. According to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s most recentÃ‚Â Online Hate and Harassment report, 22% of Americans experienced severe harassment on social media in the past 12 months, an increase from 18% in 2023. In addition, 61% of those harassed said at least some harassment happened on Facebook, 39% on Instagram, and 28% on Twitter.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWe know that online hate Ã¢Â€Â“ especially unchecked hate Ã¢Â€Â“ can and does lead to offline violence,Ã¢Â€Â said Robert Trestan, Divisional Vice President of ADL West. Ã¢Â€ÂœStudies have linked hate-motivated violence, mass shootings, and mental health issues to online activity on social media Ã¢Â€Â“ much of which disproportionately targets and affects young people and people from marginalized communities. Most social media platforms, despite being aware of the dangers, have taken few steps to resolve them. With AB 587 in effect, these companies are now held accountable for hiding hate on their platforms.Ã¢Â€Â

Platforms that do not comply with the mandated reporting may be fined up to $15,000 per day byÃ‚Â the California Attorney General, or almost $3 million per company since the law went into force. Some platforms are pushing back, and the law is being challenged in federal court in a case led by X and is currently in appeal. These challenges are not slowing national efforts to boost more social media transparency. In July 2024, Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA)Ã‚Â introduced legislation, endorsed by ADL, to protect social media users from hate speech and increase transparency from tech companies.

ADL hopes to see continued improvement with the next round of transparency reports scheduled for October 2024.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/campus-divestment-campaigns-jlens-unpacks-demands-and-consequences,"Anti-Israel protests and encampments became regular fixtures on many college campuses in the months following HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7 attack on Israel. From Columbia to UCLA, the pattern was similar, with students setting up tents in prominent spots and refusing to leave. In many cases, they have taken over and vandalized campus buildings, disrupted classes and graduations, declared Zionists unwelcome, and harassed Jewish students, creating a climate of fear among Jewish and other Israel-supporting members of the college community. Some campus protestors were even seen lauding Hamas and advocating for violence.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Four years after their high-school graduations were scaled down or canceled because of Covid, many college seniors saw the same thing happen to their university commencements this year, albeit because of the threat of disruption by protestors. And while encampments generally dissipated when school ended for the summerÃ¢Â€Â“or when they were forcibly dispersed by policeÃ¢Â€Â“there is every reason to believe anti-Israel students (and non-student participants) will re-pitch their tents and rehang their signs when they return to campus for the fall semester.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

In order to effectively combat this campaign, it is essential to understand the protestorsÃ¢Â€Â™ demands and the powerful counter-arguments against them. Articulating a clear, convincing case against divestment is increasingly urgent, especially as some universities, such as Brown, UC Riverside, The New School, and Johns Hopkins have negotiated agreements with protestors to end encampments in return for debating and voting on their demands for divestment.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Understanding the Divestment CampaignÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

This wave of protests is the latest iteration of the wider Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign that has gained steam in recent years. BDS is an international campaign aimed at delegitimizing and pressuring Israel through diplomatic, financial, professional, academic, and cultural isolation. Its ultimate goal is not to create a Palestinian state, but to dismantle the Jewish state.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Campus calls for divestment also harken back toÃ¢Â€Â“and are purposely modeled afterÃ¢Â€Â“the successful 1980s campus divestment movement against South Africa as well as more recent campus divestments relating to causes such as gun violence and environmentalism.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Even aside from the false and offensive implication that Israel is on par with the deeply oppressive Apartheid-era South Africa, there are significant moral, economic, and practical differences between previous divestment movements and the current campaign.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

So, what do these protestors actually want?Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Although the details differ campus to campus, the short answer is to divest from Israel. That means the university would cease doing business with or investing through their endowments in any company connected to Israel.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Economic ImplicationsÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

To be clear, some protestors are demanding university divestment from all companies with any connection to, or operations in, Israel. That does not just include weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin but also companies like Amazon, Google, McDonalds and every retail chain store and tech company with an Israel location or contract with an Israeli business.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Needless to say, that amounts to a lot of companies that would suddenly be excluded from an investment portfolio. More than 100 companies from the S&P 500 conduct business in Israel, including many of the world's largest and most successful companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google) and Amazon.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Divestment from Israel could therefore result in lower returns and a less diversified portfolio. This could adversely affect the university's ability to fund scholarships and research, and to maintain its facilities.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Compounding the impact, deciding to divest from Israel risks alienating alumni and donors, who could decide to reduce their contributions or withhold them entirely, resulting in greater financial losses for the university.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Fiduciary & Legal ImplicationsÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The potential for these negative consequences to the health of university endowments raises another issue arguing against divestment from Israel. University endowments are run by Investment Offices, with an Investment Committee holding ultimate oversight over investment decisions, responsible for reviewing asset allocation policies, endowment performance, and strategy proposals. Investment Committees have a fiduciary duty, which is a legal responsibility, to make decisions in the best financial interests of the university when managing the endowment investment. Allowing political considerations and pressure campaigns to dictate investment decisions could be a breach of this duty.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Choosing to divest from Israel could also bring additional legal hurdles for universities. More than 30 states have laws or executive orders prohibiting or discouraging BDS activities. State attorneys general could pursue legal action against universities engaging in boycotts directed against companies doing business with Israel.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Delegitimizing IsraelÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Agreeing to divest from Israel would set a dangerous precedent for universities. Doing so opens the door for activists supporting all sorts of causes for all sorts of reasons to make similar demands that their university divest from companies involved in a wide range of industries or practices. Such a trend could significantly limit the endowment's investment options, affecting returns and the ability to support university goals.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Instead of pushing for divestment, activists could advocate for their universities to promote programs of peace and co-existence between Israelis and Palestinians. They could demand their university endowments become activist shareholders in the companies in which they invest, using their leverage to push those companies to make strategic investments in the Palestinian economy and in peace-building initiatives.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

But that is not what is happening. The sheer breadth of activistsÃ¢Â€Â™ demands makes it clear what their real agenda is: isolation and delegitimization of Israel.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Their intention becomes clearer when you consider some of the slogans protestors have usedÃ¢Â€Â“including Ã¢Â€ÂœFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be freeÃ¢Â€Â--explicitly calling for the eradication of Israel. Others have taken aim at all Jews, with protesters at Columbia University, for instance, yelling to Jewish students to Ã¢Â€Âœgo back to Poland.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Israel, like every country, is imperfect and faces tremendous societal challenges. But Israel is a democracy where citizens enjoy equal rights and the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s only Jewish state. Comparisons to Apartheid-era South Africa and accusations of genocide are factually false, morally misguided, and used as justifications for the delegitimization of Israel. But they donÃ¢Â€Â™t hold up to scrutiny.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The ramifications of these accusations and of campus protests extend far beyond the immediate demands for divestment. Jewish students across numerous campuses report feeling increasingly marginalized and unsafe, with many questioning their place within the university community. As universities grapple with these complex issues, they must balance the right to protest with their responsibility to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students especially as anti-Israel protestors vow to fight on. The ongoing debate surrounding divestment not only affects university finances and policies but also shapes the very fabric of campus life and the educational experience for countless students. This needs to be taken into consideration as some universities will be debating and voting on divestment proposals in the coming months.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

Senior officials mused about using Jewish holidays to approve courses at the Board level to prevent Jews from attending.
The Steering Committee hired an external consultant whose writings equate Israel with Ã¢Â€Âœsettler colonialismÃ¢Â€Â and who uses social media to actively promote anti-Israel bias with antisemitic tropes, including a post about Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist control of the CA Ethnic Studies Model CurriculumÃ¢Â€Â and a comment that the Legislative Jewish Caucus needs to Ã¢Â€Âœstay in their lane,Ã¢Â€Â claiming Ã¢Â€Âœthe Zionist CA Jewish Caucus hijacked Ethnic Studies,Ã¢Â€Â as well as Ã¢Â€Âœa small white minorityÃ¢Â€Â should not Ã¢Â€Âœdictate a curriculum that is not about them.Ã¢Â€Â
A Committee leader referred to the only Jewish member as a Ã¢Â€Âœcolonized Jewish mindÃ¢Â€Â and a Ã¢Â€Âœf---ing babyÃ¢Â€Â for expressing concerns over antisemitism on the Committee.
An SAUSD Board member suggested that Jewish Americans do not belong in ethnic studies because they are Ã¢Â€Âœracialized as under the White category.Ã¢Â€Â
A Committee leader referred to the Jewish Federation of Orange County as Ã¢Â€Âœracist ZionistsÃ¢Â€Â and suggested SAUSD should not Ã¢Â€ÂœcaveÃ¢Â€Â to their representatives.
Members of the Steering Committee reportedly said, Ã¢Â€ÂœJews are not a disadvantaged ethnic group in the U.S. because they were never slaves,Ã¢Â€Â that Ã¢Â€ÂœJews greatly benefit from white privilege, so they have it better,Ã¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœwe don't need to give both sides. We only support the oppressed, and Jews are the oppressors.Ã¢Â€Â
Jewish staff members at SAUSD wrote about how they were Ã¢Â€ÂœsickÃ¢Â€Â of the Ã¢Â€Âœthinly veiled antisemitismÃ¢Â€Â coming from Committee leaders and were Ã¢Â€Âœhurt by some of thingsÃ¢Â€Â they Ã¢Â€Âœsaid about Jews.Ã¢Â€Â

Under the Brown Act (CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s open meeting laws) and AB 101 (the 2021 statute making ethnic studies a requirement for graduation from public high schools), California school boards are required to take specific steps to make members of the public aware of proposed curricula and allow for public comment.

The motion and supporting evidence proves that SAUSD knowingly circumvented these laws to approve curricula with dangerously anti-Jewish teachings before the public became aware of them. The lawsuit asks the court to declare that SAUSD violated the Brown Act, to bar SAUSD from teaching courses that were unlawfully approved, and to order SAUSD to follow open meeting laws going forward so that new ethnic studies courses are not pushed through without community input.

Ã¢Â€ÂœBoth the Brown Act and AB 101 require transparency and opportunity for public comment on proposed ethnic studies curricula that deviate from the state-approved model curriculum,Ã¢Â€Â said L. Rachel Lerman, General Counsel of the Brandeis Center, which is both a plaintiff and counsel in this matter. Ã¢Â€ÂœGovernor Newsom swore that biased and antisemitic content taken out of early (and disapproved) versions of the model curriculum would Ã¢Â€Â˜never see the light of day.Ã¢Â€Â™ He did not mean that this content should be snuck back in under cover of darkness, but that appears to be what has occurred.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœOpen meetings are required by law specifically to prevent this type of situation,Ã¢Â€Â said James Pasch, ADL Senior Director of National Litigation. Ã¢Â€ÂœAs the evidence shows, the district intentionally hid information from the public, to try to get away with teaching antisemitic lies to the next generation in Santa Ana. The antisemitism that infected this process sent a clear message to Jewish students and families that their voices are not welcomed, and that they were intentionally excluded.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is not speculation. Discovery in this case has revealed a persistent pattern of antisemitism in the steering committee,Ã¢Â€Â saidÃ‚Â American Jewish Committee Chief Legal Officer Marc Stern.Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€ÂœAntisemitism has no place in any governmental body and it is doubly concerning when it involves children and their education. That proponents of this proposal made a concerted effort to hide their antisemitism is yet further evidence that they knew what they were doing was wrong and did not want it disclosed publicly.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœAs Justice Louis D. Brandeis famously observed, 'sunlight is the best disinfectant.' The shocking evidence our team has uncovered shows that SAUSD deliberately tried to keep the public in the dark about the extreme biases and antisemitism that infected the District's ethnic studies curriculum. In doing so, SAUSD violated State law,Ã¢Â€Â said Dan Shallman, lead counsel from Covington & Burling LLP. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe look forward to making our case in court that SAUSD's actions must not stand. We are proud to stand with our partners at the ADL, the Brandeis Center, and AJC, in seeking to hold SAUSD accountable.Ã¢Â€Â

ADL, the Brandeis Center, AJC, and Covington & Burling serve as the plaintiffsÃ¢Â€Â™ counsel for this case. A hearing is scheduled for September 19, 2024.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/turkey-attacker-inspired-accelerationism-and-mass-killers-manifesto-shows,"An 18-year-old suspect who livestreamed himself stabbing multiple people near a mosque in the Turkish city of EskiÃ…ÂŸehir on August 12, 2024, was fueled by the extremist belief in accelerationism and motivated by past mass killers including white supremacists, an analysis by the ADL Center on Extremism has shown.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Wearing a skull mask and a tactical vest with a sonnenrad patch Ã¢Â€Â” both common symbols utilized by white supremacists and accelerationists Ã¢Â€Â” and armed with a hatchet and two knives, the teen injured at least five people during the filmed attack, which quickly circulated on X and Telegram. He was later apprehended and detained by police.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The investigation by COE found that on the day of the stabbings, the assailant created a Telegram chat where he shared a file containing his Ã¢Â€ÂœmanifestoÃ¢Â€Â -- which was rife with antisemitism -- and other extremist publications. Just minutes before the attack, another Telegram user reshared links to the manifesto and forwarded a post from the suspect with the planned time of the attack, announcing the Ã¢Â€ÂœSTREAM WILL START IN A FEW MINUTES.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â  Following the attack, that same user shared a recording of the attackerÃ¢Â€Â™s livestream.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Turkish media outlets have reported that the assailant discussed the attack with someone from Eastern Europe on Steam, a gaming and social media platform.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

AttackerÃ¢Â€Â™s ScreedÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

A review of the attackerÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€ÂœmanifestoÃ¢Â€Â indicated that he harbors extreme misanthropic and racist views; was inspired by many prior mass killers, including white supremacists; and was driven by accelerationism, an extremist belief that society is irredeemable, collapse is inevitable and the best course of action is to Ã¢Â€ÂœaccelerateÃ¢Â€Â this collapse through chaos and violence.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

In his manifesto, the attacker wrote Ã¢Â€Âœ[t]his system will eventually collapse ... [m]y actions and yours will accelerate this collapse and sooner or later the country, and then the world, will be covered in anarchy.Ã¢Â€Â He also urged readers to Ã¢Â€Âœgo to the nearest electrical transformer station and sabotage it ... you can even take it to the next level and cut down the electrical transmission towers in any forest.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Such calls for sabotage are often seen in accelerationist propaganda.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Describing himself as a Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Socialist,Ã¢Â€Â the attacker expressed hatred for a range of people, including Kurds, Jews, communists, feminists and Black people. He referenced Jews more than any other group, encouraging others to attack synagogues, sharing antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and promoting the false claim that Jews finance degeneracy.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

COE also uncovered antisemitic comments the assailant posted on Steam in 2023. Using the screen name Ã¢Â€ÂœSkrewdriver,Ã¢Â€Â the assailant wrote ""getting a job is Jewish I'd rather stay unemployed"" and shared multiple copy pastas memes (blocks of digital text that can be copied and pasted across platforms) about ""ZOG,"" an acronym for Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist Occupied GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â that references the antisemitic belief that the government is controlled by Jews.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Copypastas posted on Steam by the attacker referencing ZOG (Zionist Occupied Government) in July 2023.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The assailant claimed he was not associated with an extremist group and declared that he was a Ã¢Â€Âœlone wolf.Ã¢Â€Â He also expressed admiration for other lone wolf far-right mass killers including the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, who killed over 70 people, the shooter in the 2019 mosque attacks in New Zealand who gunned down 50 people, and the Jacksonville gunman who killed three at a store in 2023.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The teen suspect likened himself to these killers, all of whom are regularly lauded by accelerationists, and expressed a desire to be listed among them following his attack.Ã‚Â  He also hoped to inspire others to act on their hatred and encouraged readers to livestream their own violent actions to encourage future attackers.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

InfluencesÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The EskiÃ…ÂŸehir attacker expressed admiration for many mass killers throughout his manifesto, referring to terrorists such as the Oslo shooter, the Christchurch shooter, and the Oklahoma City bomber as Ã¢Â€Âœsaints,Ã¢Â€Â a term of reverence used by accelerationists. He also included photos of other American mass killers that he admired, including the Columbine shooters and Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Essentially using predecessor attacks as a blueprint, the EskiÃ…ÂŸehir attacker emulated elements of their actions and writings. Mimicking both the Christchurch and Jacksonville shooters, he included a Ã¢Â€ÂœQuestion and AnswerÃ¢Â€Â section in his manifesto and scrawled white supremacist symbols on his weapon, including a swastika, SS bolts and KKK. He also livestreamed his rampage on social media Ã¢Â€Â” a tactic utilized by several prior mass attackers.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

Although he lived in Turkey, the EskiÃ…ÂŸehir attacker appears to have been heavily influenced by Western extremist propaganda. In his manifesto, he used English-language memes and slurs and included the logo for the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, a US based neo-Nazi accelerationist group. The file of propaganda he shared along with his manifesto included Siege, a collection of essays written by American neo-Nazi James Mason, and Industrial Society and its Future, the manifesto of American domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The EskiÃ…ÂŸehir attacker also encouraged readers to make explosives and Ã¢Â€Âœblow up federal buildingsÃ¢Â€Â in a manner similar to the Oklahoma City bomber, though Turkey, being a unitary state, does not have equivalent Ã¢Â€Âœfederal buildings.Ã¢Â€Â He also held great disdain for communists, a common refrain among far-right extremists in the United States and wrote that he initially planned to attack a building belonging to the Turkish Communist Party despite it holding little power or significance in Turkish politics.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

At the same time, the dislike of radical leftist groups which have been villainized by TurkeyÃ¢Â€Â™s Islamist-ultranationalist ruling bloc shows local influence.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The EskiÃ…ÂŸehir attackerÃ¢Â€Â™s influences extended beyond American mass killers. Along with his manifesto, he shared copies of the Christchurch and Bratislava shooterÃ¢Â€Â™s manifestos, as well as all three publications released by the Terrorgram Collective, an international network of propagandists that create instructional manuals designed to inspire acts of violence and sabotage. In his screed, the suspect advised readers to save these documents, as they would be Ã¢Â€ÂœusefulÃ¢Â€Â to those who seek to plan their own attack.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The assailant also appears to have been influenced by online gamer culture, dedicating a section of his manifesto to an item list assigning points based on the attackerÃ¢Â€Â™s clothing, weapons, methods and number of casualties, seeking to gamify his attack and future ones carried out by others.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Extremist ReactionsÃ‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

While the Turkey mosque attacker sought to inspire others and join the ranks of the mass killers, he has largely been ridiculed by other extremists online. On 4chan and incels.is, a popular incels forum, users have criticized the assailant for failing to kill anyone. On Telegram, some white supremacist and accelerationist groups disavowed his actions altogether because they considered him to be non-white.","[2, 3, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.2, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.6}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-honor-music-industry-legend-scooter-braun-his-leading-role-bringing,"Braun to be recognized at 30th anniversary ADL Concert Against Hate at the Kennedy Center


New York, NY, August 15, 2024 Ã¢Â€Â“ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced that entertainment executive Scooter Braun will be recognized for his instrumental role in bringing the Nova Music Festival Exhibition to audiences in the United States. Ã¢Â€Âœ6:29 AM: the Moment the Music Stood StillÃ¢Â€Â powerfully chronicles the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre at the Nova Music Festival in Israel, where thousands gathered for a celebration of life, peace and music.Ã‚Â 

A poignant, powerful tribute, the Nova exhibition serves as a wide, in-depth remembrance of the 405 people killed, 45 people kidnapped, and a tribute to those who survived the largest massacre in music history and the deadliest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust.

Braun will be honored during the 2024 ADL In Concert Against Hate, for his courageous leadership in bringing the exhibition to communities across the U.S. and for being an ardent advocate for the Jewish community. The Nova Music Festival Exhibition comes to Los Angeles this month after a sold-out extended run in New York, where 113,000 visitors honored the departed during a period of three months.

Ã¢Â€ÂœSince Oct. 7, Scooter Braun has used his platform and voice to share stories of survivors, advocate for the return of hostages and to educate his followers and the public about the horrific events that day,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœAt a time when some were trying to explain away or even deny the atrocities that took place at the Nova Music Festival, Braun was working tirelessly to ensure this exhibit was seen by countless people across America, giving them the painful but essential experience of staring directly into the face of hate and finding the resolve to fight it.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœOn Oct. 7th the largest massacre in the history of music took place at the Nova Music Festival and in response too many in our industry stayed silent. Over 400 innocent music lovers were murdered and over 40 taken hostage and many still waiting to come home. Music must always be aÃ‚Â safe place and the silence was deafening,Ã¢Â€Â said Scooter Braun. Ã¢Â€ÂœAlongside Joe Teplow, Josh Kadden, and the amazing organizers of Nova, we were able to bring this exhibit to fruition in New York, and now Los Angeles. Our goal is to have all people see themselves through their own love of music and live concerts. I am honored and humbled to accept this award, and accept it on behalf of the amazing tribe of Nova. We canÃ¢Â€Â™t and should not look awayÃ¢Â€Â¦ and we must dance again.Ã¢Â€Â

Braun was recently awarded by Mayor Eric Adams of New York for his efforts to encourage peace during the annual Jewish Heritage Celebration at Gracie Mansion in May. Braun also launched the Care Together campaign in March, where he donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Care International and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, to get much needed financial support to the people most acutely impacted by the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine.

Braun also served as co-founder of the One Love Manchester benefit concert, in response to the May 22, 2017 terrorist bombing at Manchester Arena, which killed 22 people and injured over 1,000. In only two weeks, Braun, alongside Ariana Grande, Simon Moran, and Melvin Benn, organized the concert and telethon, which was attended by over 55,000 people and saw proceeds donated to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund to help victims of the attack and their families. Following the show, the British Red Cross received more than Ã‚Â£10 million in donations.

Braun is also part of the First Responders ChildrenÃ¢Â€Â™s Foundation, World Central Kitchen, Safe Heart, HIAS, Pencils of Promise, Fuck Cancer, Care.org, Save a ChildÃ¢Â€Â™s Heart, serves as a board member of Make A Wish and Pencils of Promise, and personally founded, led efforts for, or heavily participated within the Hand in Hand benefit after Hurricane Harvey, March for Our Lives, the Stuck with U x First Responders ChildrenÃ¢Â€Â™s Foundation, and the Braun Fellowship for Youth Activism.

ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€ÂœIn Concert Against HateÃ¢Â€Â will celebrate its 30th anniversary this fall at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. The annualÃ‚Â concert and award ceremony recognizes celebrities and everyday heroes who have played a significant role in standing up to hatred, injustice and bias across society. This yearÃ¢Â€Â™s In Concert Against Hate will be held on Monday, Nov. 18 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Actors, musicians, civil rights leaders, policymakers and friends of ADL will join the celebration.

Previous honorees at the ADL Concert have included various individuals and groups such as Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), Ruby Bridges, Gavin Grimm, Daniel Pearl, Imam Abdullah Antepli, Olivia Coley-Pearson, Tova Friedman and Aron Goodman, Judy and Dennis Shepard, Susan Bro and Eva Kor, and many others.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/news/theres-no-place-antisemitism-especially-not-olympics,"Given the harrowing history of Israel at the games, we must be vigilant in safeguarding Jewish athletes


by Jonathan Greenblatt

The 2024 Paris OlympicsÃ¢Â€Â™ motto is Ã¢Â€ÂœGames Wide OpenÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â“ but we must ask: Are these games truly wide open to Israelis and Jews?

Sports are often touted as a great equaliser, especially at the Olympics. However, sports can also serve as a vehicle for harmful elements in society, including anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination. Ã‚Â 

Even before the games began, Israeli athletes faced threats promising Ã¢Â€ÂœWe will repeat Munich 1972Ã¢Â€Â, referring to the Olympic games in Munich where Palestinian terrorists murdered 11 Israeli athletes. The Israeli team was later forced to carry out the memorial ceremony for those same 1972 Israeli victims in secret.

Kicking off the opening ceremony, a Palestinian Olympian was allowed to wear a shirt depicting bombs dropping from planes despite political messaging restrictions for all countries. Meanwhile, Israeli Olympians were barred from wearing yellow ribbons in support of the 115 Israeli hostages who are still being held by Hamas.

In a soccer match between Israel and Paraguay, members of the crowd chanted Ã¢Â€ÂœHeil HitlerÃ¢Â€Â and held up their hands in Nazi salutes. And the list goes on.

We cannot stand by as Israeli and Jewish athletes are targeted by such attacks. Given the harrowing history of Israel at the Olympic Games, we must be especially vigilant in safeguarding their physical and mental well-being Ã¢Â€Â“ both crucial to their performance.

These athletes have dedicated their lives to reaching this moment and have achieved extraordinary successes this past week, including winning a record of three medals in one day on Saturday. They achieved this while already facing immense pressure, and dealing with everything from unsportsmanlike behavior to outright death threats is unacceptable.

Sports have the power to unite and inspire, but when antisemitism or any other form of discrimination seeps into this arena, it undermines these ideals and creates a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli athletes.

But letÃ¢Â€Â™s be clear: The anti-Semitism weÃ¢Â€Â™re witnessing in the 2024 Olympic Games didnÃ¢Â€Â™t happen in a vacuum. In Europe, Latin America and beyond, tensions in the Middle East have long led to increases in anti-Semitic attacks. However, we havenÃ¢Â€Â™t experienced anything like the tsunami of anti-Jewish hate unleashed worldwide following the Hamas atrocities of October 7.

According to ADLÃ¢Â€Â™s 2023 Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States reached an unprecedented all-time high, reflecting a 140 per cent increase from the previous year. In the three-month period between October 7 and the end of 2023, ADL recorded more anti-Semitic incidents than any other year on record with a shocking 5,204 incidents. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s an average of 60 per day.

This trend is not unique to the United States; similar spikes are occurring globally.

The United Kingdom saw a 147 per cent increase in anti-Semitic incidents between 2022 and 2023. Since October 7, around 100 anti-Semitic incidents have taken place in France every month. Alarmingly, even before October 7, 96 per cent of Jews in Europe reported that they had encountered anti-Semitism in the past year Ã¢Â€Â“ essentially, everyone.

WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s important to remember when skimming over these shocking figures is that these statistics arenÃ¢Â€Â™t just numbers. There is an innocent human being behind every one of them.

Jewish children in the Philadelphia school district are facing anti-Semitic bullying and harassment from within the educational institutions that are supposed to protect them. Jewish schools and community centers are being attacked in Canada. A 12-year-old Jewish girl was gang raped in a Parisian suburb.

Wake up. When anti-Zionists and violent extremists demonise and dehumanise Israelis and the Jewish state, whether on or off the field, it leads to the dehumanisation and terrorisation of Jews worldwide.

To preserve the integrity of sports and uphold a safe, respectful environment for all participants, we must confront and eradicate anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. There is simply no place for it.

Ensuring that every athlete can compete without fear or prejudice is not just a matter of fairness Ã¢Â€Â“ itÃ¢Â€Â™s essential to maintaining the true spirit of the games.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

It is predictable but still problematic to see Israel scapegoated as the cause of the riots raging across the United Kingdom involving far-right elements. This is happening across social media. The claims have no basis and contribute to the increasing anxiety among the Jews in the country, a segment of British society already alienated by an enormous spike in antisemitic incidents.

While the far-right elements involved in the riots have their own history of antisemitism Ã¢Â€Â“ including Holocaust denial and praise for Hitler Ã¢Â€Â“ the riots themselves have sparked antisemitic conspiracy theories claiming the unrest is the result of an Israeli plot.

On August 3, 2024, American white supremacist and antisemite Nicholas Fuentes floated the idea that former leader of the English Defense League (EDL), Tommy Robinson (AKA Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), had sparked the riots to punish the UK Government for suspending arms export licenses to Israel. He provided no facts to substantiate this allegation.

Robinson Ã¢Â€Â” an anti-Muslim extremist who himself has been associated with the far-right Ã¢Â€Â” has made a show of support for Israel on a number of occasions, but this support has been condemned as unwelcome by the Board of DeputiesÃ‚Â of British Jews and the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/haniyeh-his-own-words,"Ismail Haniyeh, who wasÃ‚Â killed on July 31, 2024 in Tehran, led the so-called politburo ofÃ‚Â Hamas, aÃ‚Â US-designated Islamist terror organization dedicated to the destruction of the State of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.

HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ foundingÃ‚Â covenant issued in 1988, which echoes the notoriousÃ‚Â Protocols of the Elders of Zion charging Jews with an international conspiracy to gain control of the world, is replete with antisemitism, just as its revisedÃ‚Â 2017 charter. In HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ world-view, Islamic precepts forbid a Jewish state in the area known as Palestine, and the Jewish people have no legitimate connection to the land of Israel. As its covenant proclaims, ""The land of Palestine is an Islamic trust... It is forbidden to anyone to yield or concede any part of it... Israel will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it..."" To this end, the leaders of Hamas have denounced compromise with Israel as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.

Since his death, various figures have labeled Haniyeh as a moderating force, and separate from Hamas' extreme ideology and terrorist actions, yet nothing could be further from the truth.Ã‚Â  Hamas' ideology and terrorism were deeply integral to Haniyeh's own operations and statements.

Following quotes expose HaniyehÃ¢Â€Â™s extremist worldview:

Speaking before the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Qatar on January 9, 2024, Haniyeh justified the October 7 attacks as a response to the success of the Abraham Accords,Ã‚Â Ã‚Â saying:

""[Ã¢Â€Â¦] why was there the Al-Aqsa Flood, why this roaring flood, this strategic shift in the path of resistance and jihad? In response, I say there were three developments before the Al-Aqsa Flood, before the seventh of October. The first development is the marginalization of the Palestinian cause at the global level. The international community, global decision-making circles no longer invoke the Palestinian cause.""

He also celebrated the October 7 at the same event in Qatar,Ã‚Â saying:

""We must build upon this victory that occurred on the seventh of October. We must hold on to it, build upon it, and accumulate it.""

On October 26, 2023, in the wake of the October 7 attacks and IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s response, Haniyeh welcomed and celebrated the deaths of ordinary Palestinians in Gaza,Ã‚Â saying:

""As I have said repeatedly, the blood of children, women, and the elderly should not make you cry out! Rather, we need this blood to awaken the revolution, to awaken stubbornness, to awaken and move forward.""

In an Al-Jazeera interview aired in January 2022, Haniyeh celebrated Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli cities:

In reference to the targeting of Israeli cities during the 2021 Gaza crisis (May 6 Ã¢Â€Â“ 21, 2021) Haniyeh described mass rocket attacks on Tel Aviv as a ""strategic victory""Ã‚Â saying, ""for 11 days, the rockets of the Qassam Brigades rained down on every inch of Israel, and especially its heart Ã¢Â€Â“ Tel Aviv, the heart of trade, economic activity, business [Ã¢Â€Â¦] Tel Aviv was targeted, in less than 5 minutes [Ã¢Â€Â¦] with 130 rockets from inside the Gaza Strip.""

In an interview dated July 26, 2020, Haniyeh boasted of rejecting a ceasefire agreement, and insisted on the annihilation of Israel as a condition for disarming Hamas:

In reference to a peace deal offer by which HaniyehÃ‚Â explained, ""Gaza [...] would become like Singapore [including] the construction of an airport, a seaport, and economic projects in Gaza"" in return for which Hamas would recognize IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s right to exist, ""disband the military wings and incorporate them into the police force"" Haniyeh said ""naturally, we completely rejected that offer"" preferring to hold on to HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ ""political principles, resistance, [and] weapons.""Ã‚Â 

When asked what these political principles were, he made it clear that the annihilation of Israel was his core agenda: ""We will not recognize Israel, Palestine must stretch from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea, the Right of Return [must be granted], the prisoners must be set free, and a fully sovereign Palestinian state must be established with Jerusalem as its capital.""

In a public address in May 2021, Haniyeh praising three of the most important Hamas figures behind the October 7 attack, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Al-Deif and Marwan Issa, for launching the attacks on Israel during the 2021 Gaza crisis,Ã‚Â saying:

""Ã¢Â€Â¦my greetings to the resistance and its leadership in Gaza, foremost among them, my dear brother, the gallant Yahya Sinwar [Ã¢Â€Â¦] and the leader, the mujahid, my dear friend, Mohammed Deif, this brave hero, this blessed man, who is known by millions [even though] they have not seen his face, but they chant his name because Allah has elevated his nameÃ¢Â€Â¦and Marwan Issa and the [other] pillars of the resistance [who are with him, i.e. Deif] because of his sincerity, selflessness, humility and love of Jihad.""

At a press-conference in January 2006, Haniyeh eulogized IRGC-Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani, saying:

""[Ã¢Â€Â¦] the martyr and leader Soleimani Ã¢Â€Â“ who spent his life supporting the resistance [i.e. Hamas] as the head of the Quds Force in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Ã¢Â€Â“ because of everything he has done, [he] is a martyr for Jerusalem. He is a martyr for Jerusalem, he is a martyr for Jerusalem!""

In the same address, Haniyeh praised the Islamic Republic of Iran for military support during 2021Gaza Crisis,Ã‚Â saying:

""[Ã¢Â€Â¦] and I must thank those who provided money and weaponry to the valiant resistance. The Islamic Republic of Iran, who did not hold back on money, weapons and technical support.""

Addressing a conference in Tehran on the occasion of Quds Day, 2024, Haniyeh praised Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini,Ã‚Â saying:

""First, we remember on this great day Imam Khomeini,Ã‚Â may Allah have mercy on him. [Ã¢Â€Â¦] He called for Jerusalem Day so that the nation rises to its duty and unifies its forces to liberate Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa from the clutches of the usurping Zionist occupation.

Haniyeh also praised the Islamic Republic of IranÃ¢Â€Â™s ""Axis of Resistance"" and affirmed HamasÃ¢Â€Â™ role within it: Ã¢Â€Âœ[T]his blessed battle has united the ranks of the nationÃ¢Â€Â™s children, and the greatest scene of this unity has been manifested in the arenas and fronts from Palestine to Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, with the support and backing of the Islamic Republic of Iran.""","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/targeting-hillel-antisemites-and-anti-israel-activists-push-undermine-jewish-life,"Hillel International, the premier Jewish on-campus organization that supports Jewish life at hundreds of colleges across the United States and abroad, has been one of the most frequent targets of anti-Israel activists and other antisemites in recent months, totaling more than a hundred incidents in the U.S. since HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Jewish students and Hillel staff members have received threatening emails and phone calls; Hillel buildings have been vandalized and tagged with graffiti; and Hillel-sponsored events have been protested; and in some cases, anti-Israel student groups have even launched campaignsÃ‚Â demanding that Hillel be banned entirely from universities.

Most recently, on July 19, 2024, an anti-Zionist student group at the University of Wisconsin, MilwaukeeÃ‚Â posted a message on social media declaring that Ã¢Â€ÂœANY organization or entity that supports Israel is not welcome at UWM,Ã¢Â€Â calling out Hillel and the Jewish Federation by name. The post went on to ominously state that these organizations Ã¢Â€Âœwill be treated accordingly as extremist criminals. Stay tuned.Ã¢Â€Â

The university administrationÃ‚Â quickly denounced the threatening language, but UW-Milwaukee Popular University for Palestine Ã¢Â€Â” the group that published the original post and also served as a key organizer of theÃ‚Â anti-Israel encampment at the school earlier in the spring Ã¢Â€Â” doubled down on its rhetoric in a follow-up post that reiterated that Zionist groups Ã¢Â€Âœwill not be normalized or welcomed on our campus.Ã¢Â€Â The groupÃ¢Â€Â™s statement was endorsed by UW-MilwaukeeÃ¢Â€Â™s chapters ofÃ‚Â Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and others.

The university has since temporarily suspended the SJP chapter and those of SDS and YDSA.

This extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric that seeks to target and marginalize mainstream Jewish organizations reflects a concerning trend that has taken hold across the United States since October 7. This sentiment has manifested in direct actions against the American Jewish community on the ground and online. College campuses, in particular, have been aÃ‚Â hotbed of antisemitic rhetoric and activity.Ã‚Â 

Antisemitic Targeting of Hillel-Affiliated Individuals and Property


Since October, antisemites and others have frequently targeted members of the Hillel community or Hillel property. The ADL Center on Extremism has tallied incidents on dozens of US campuses over the past 10 months.

Many of these incidents have included references to the Israel-Hamas war, engaged in a classic antisemitic practice of holding Jewish people around the world accountable for the actions of the State of Israel.Ã‚Â 

On October 13, an individual on a bike yelled, Ã¢Â€ÂœFuck the JewsÃ¢Â€Â as he passed students marking Shabbat in the front yard of Hillel at the University of California, Davis. At Ohio State University on November 9,Ã‚Â two individuals entered the Hillel building, vandalized two Israeli flags that were on display in the lobby, and yelled expletives and anti-Israel statements at staff.Ã‚Â 

On February 2, Jewish students eating Shabbat dinner at the Ohio State University Hillel were interrupted when other students allegedly began banging on the windows and shouting, Ã¢Â€ÂœFree Palestine.Ã¢Â€Â At the University of California, Riverside on February 16, an individual entered the Hillel building and harassed students, yelling, Ã¢Â€ÂœFree Palestine,Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœFuck the IDFÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœYou are terrorists.Ã¢Â€Â

Hillel employees and Hillel-affiliated accounts haveÃ‚Â frequently received threatening and conspiratorial notes via email, phone, text message and social media since October 7, often referencing Israel or other common antisemitic slogans.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â 

A week after HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s attack, Jewish students and Hillel staff members at Miami University in Oxford, OH received antisemitic emails that stated, Ã¢Â€ÂœThe best Jew is a dead Jew.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Later in October, Hillel employees in multiple states received antisemitic emails stating, Ã¢Â€ÂœIsrael did 9/11.Ã¢Â€Â In November, a Jewish student at the University of Texas at Dallas received anonymous antisemitic and anti-Zionist text messages that included comments such as, Ã¢Â€ÂœDeath to Jews.Ã¢Â€Â In January, staff from Hillel and the Office of Jewish Life at Lehigh University and Lafayette College in Pennsylvania received several harassing messages, including one that threatened to bring members of Hamas to campus.

Also in January, at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, the Hillel chapter received an email that read: Ã¢Â€ÂœIn the name of the innocent Palestinian women and children who have been raped and murdered en masse by the Satanic U.S.-backed IDF, I will be shooting any and all Jewish students and/or teachers I can find on campus.Ã¢Â€Â At the University of Denver, a Hillel employee received a threatening antisemitic text message that included Ã¢Â€ÂœI will not feel guilty sending you all back in time to die in the holocaust [sic].Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â

Ã‚Â 

Hillel buildings have also beenÃ‚Â frequently vandalized with similar antisemitic and anti-Zionist messages and some have beenÃ‚Â tagged with slogans like Ã¢Â€ÂœFree PalestineÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.Ã¢Â€Â

Posters, signs and other displays on Hillel property commemorating those who were killed or kidnapped on October 7 have been defaced and damaged. In February, an antisemitic flier was placed on the University of Virginia Hillel that included the words: Ã¢Â€ÂœGo back to Europe, Free Palestine.Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â 

Campaigns and Protests Seeking to Ban Hillel from Campuses


Calls to ban Hillel are in effect calls to fundamentally undercut Jewish life on campus for students and community members. These demands emerged earlier in 2024 and,Ã‚Â as previously reported by ADL, became increasingly prevalent during the wave of anti-Israel student encampments that began in April.

In some cases, demonstrations in support of these explicitly antisemitic demands have been coupled with antisemitic tropes and imagery.Ã‚Â 

In late February, anti-Israel protesters at Hunter College, part of the City University of New York (CUNY) system,Ã‚Â held a protest to declare Ã¢Â€ÂœZionist donors and financiers out of Jewish campus life.Ã¢Â€Â In announcing the protest, organizers Ã¢Â€Â” including Not In Our Name (NION) CUNY,Ã‚Â Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) Barnard/Columbia, Palestine Solidarity Alliance (PSA) of Hunter College, Jews Against Zionism at NYU, and others Ã¢Â€Â” wrote: Ã¢Â€ÂœHillel International has played a critical role in indoctrinating Jewish youths into Zionism and distorting values of Jewish communityÃ¢Â€Â¦We call upon New York City Jewish students, alumni, staff, and faculty, to join us in raising our voices against this insidious multi-billion-dollar project and to join the call in divesting from Zionism, standing in solidarity with Palestine, and building new Jewish campus spaces free from racist violence.Ã¢Â€Â

At the protest, demonstrators addressed Hunter CollegeÃ¢Â€Â™s Jewish community, chanting: Ã¢Â€ÂœJews on campus pick a side!Ã¢Â€Â These chants echoed age-old antisemitic tropesÃ‚Â accusing Jews of disloyalty.Ã‚Â 

At the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) in March, anti-Israel students and facultyÃ‚Â protested a Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish Unity WalkÃ¢Â€Â hosted by the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s chapters of Hillel, Chabad, Alpha Epsilon Pi, and StandWithUs. Protest organizers stated: Ã¢Â€ÂœLetÃ¢Â€Â™s make it clearÃ¢Â€Â¦zionism [sic] is not welcome on our campus.Ã¢Â€Â

This declaration was emphasized later in the spring when the UCSC SJP chapter and other groups launched an encampment on May 1 and explicitlyÃ‚Â called for UCSC to Ã¢Â€Âœcut tiesÃ¢Â€Â with Hillel. Jews Against White Supremacy (JAWS) at UCSC and Faculty for Justice in Palestine (FJP) at UCSC reiterated this demand in a lengthy Instagram post on May 9 under the headline Ã¢Â€ÂœWhy universities must cut ties with Hillel.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

Similar demands were made by students at the School of Visual Arts in New York, NY. When they began a sit-in at the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s administrative building on May 2, the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s SJP chapterÃ‚Â demanded that the university Ã¢Â€Âœcut ties with Hillel International and any other Zionist institutions.Ã¢Â€Â

The SJP chapter disparaged Hillel as Ã¢Â€Âœan explicitly Zionist clubÃ¢Â€Â and attacked the organization for facilitating Jewish studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ travel to Israel via the Birthright program. In another published statement, sit-in organizers reaffirmed: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe demand that the school doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t foster a space for zionist [sic] organizations such as Hillel.Ã¢Â€Â

At Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA, students launched an encampment on May 18 and demanded that the university Ã¢Â€Âœimmediately terminate Drexel's chapter of Hillel, a global zionist [sic] campus organization,Ã¢Â€Â as well as DrexelÃ¢Â€Â™s chapter of Chabad, another Jewish campus organization. The list of demands further stated that these Ã¢Â€Âœorganizations must be replaced by non-zionist [sic] Jewish ones that in no way support the ongoing genocide, occupation, or apartheid in Palestine or are funded by such.Ã¢Â€Â

Similarly, when University of Pittsburgh anti-Israel students relaunched an encampment on June 2, theyÃ‚Â explicitly called for the university to Ã¢Â€ÂœREJECT the normalization of ties with the Zionist regime. Namely, CANCEL all official partnerships with organizations promoting the normalization of apartheid and occupation. Immediately terminate PittÃ¢Â€Â™s chapter of Hillel.Ã¢Â€Â

On June 5, anti-Israel student groups across several New York City universitiesÃ‚Â held a Ã¢Â€ÂœRally against HillelÃ¢Â€Â at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York (CUNY) system, to declare Ã¢Â€Âœno fascists on campus.Ã¢Â€Â Co-sponsors included SJP at Baruch College, SJP at FIT, CUNY for Palestine, Not In Our Name (NION) CUNY, CUNY Gaza Solidarity Encampment, Palestine Solidarity Alliance (PSA) of Hunter College,Ã‚Â Within Our Lifetime (WOL) and others. The protest announcement stated: Ã¢Â€ÂœAs part of the CGSEÃ¢Â€Â™s [CUNY Gaza Solidarity EncampmentÃ¢Â€Â™s] 5 Demands, we demand CUNY sever its partnerships with Hillel International for its direct complicity in genocide in Gaza.Ã¢Â€Â

A social media post shared by organizers of an anti-Hillel protest at Baruch College in New York, NY on June 5, 2024, states protestersÃ¢Â€Â™ demand that Ã¢Â€ÂœCUNY ends all partnership with Hillel International.Ã¢Â€Â (source: Instagram)Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Both on social media and in person, protesters insertedÃ‚Â inverted red triangle imagery (which since October 7 has frequently been used to glorify Hamas violence against Israel and Zionists) into the Hillel logo alongside the slogan, Ã¢Â€ÂœIt is right to rebel; Hillel go to hell!Ã¢Â€Â Protesters were also seen wearing headbands bearing the logos of U.S.-designated terror groupsÃ‚Â Hamas and theÃ‚Â Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP); chanting slogans like Ã¢Â€ÂœHillel, Hillel, what do you say? How many kids did you kill today?Ã¢Â€Â; and carrying a banner depicting antisemitic imagery of a swastika inside a Star of David.

Protests Against Hillel-Sponsored Events and Related Actions


Numerous Hillel-sponsored events on college campuses have been disrupted by anti-Israel activists since October 7. In many cases, protesters sought to harass or silence Jewish speakers Ã¢Â€Â” even when the speakersÃ¢Â€Â™ remarks were not focused on Israel.Ã‚Â 

For example, on February 29 at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC, anti-Israel studentsÃ‚Â protested a Hillel-hosted eventÃ‚Â sponsored by the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s Division of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusive Excellence. Protesters stood outside the room where the event Ã¢Â€Â” an Ã¢Â€ÂœAsk Me AnythingÃ¢Â€Â session with a deaf rabbi who lives in Israel Ã¢Â€Â” was taking place, chanting slogans like Ã¢Â€ÂœWe want justice you say how; Zionists off our campus now!Ã¢Â€Â

A protest leader affiliated with Maryland 2 PalestineÃ‚Â told the crowd outside the Gallaudet event: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe have a responsibility to plan more protests, to show up at every disgusting Hillel event!Ã¢Â€Â That same speaker added, Ã¢Â€ÂœI donÃ¢Â€Â™t have the ability to be friends with ZionistsÃ¢Â€Â¦ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no neutrality here. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s [sic] no two sides. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s one side Ã¢Â€Â” one right side Ã¢Â€Â” and one wrong side. And all of you here are on the right side. Everyone whoÃ¢Â€Â™s hiding in there [indicating the room in which the Hillel event was taking place] is on the wrong side.Ã¢Â€Â As individuals who had attended the Hillel event left the room, protesters harassed them, shouting Ã¢Â€ÂœShame on you!Ã¢Â€Â

Ã‚Â 

On April 4,Ã‚Â SJP members and others protested a Hillel-hosted event at the University of California, Riverside featuring transgender Israeli man Michael Alroy to speak about Ã¢Â€Âœgender identity and Judaism.Ã¢Â€Â Protesters highlighted AlroyÃ¢Â€Â™s past Israeli military service, with SJP UCR writing on social media ahead of the protest: Ã¢Â€ÂœUCR Hillel is bringing Michael Alroy, a known former IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier to our campus, and utilizing this event to pinkwash a genocide.Ã¢Â€Â

On May 3, anti-Zionist student protesters at New York University (NYU) and other NYC schools announced a protest designed to coincide with the Hillel-sponsored Ã¢Â€ÂœShabbat for 2000,Ã¢Â€Â an annual on-campus Shabbat dinner that brings together thousands of students, alumni, and other community members. The protesters initially planned to gather directly outside the building where the Hillel Shabbat was taking place but relocated at the last minute apparently due to NYPD blocking certain streets.

Hillel-sponsored events related to October 7 or the ongoing Israel-Hamas war have also been frequent protest targets, with protesters often harassing the Hillel members and Jewish students attending these events.Ã‚Â 

Anti-Israel students at the University of PittsburghÃ‚Â protested a Hillel-hosted event on January 24 featuring Yadin Gellman, an IDF veteran and Israeli actor, shouting Ã¢Â€Âœfucking ZionistsÃ¢Â€Â at attendees. Afterward, protest organizers SJP at Pitt, the Pittsburgh Palestine Coalition, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) Pittsburgh chapter thanked those who had joined their protest and declared on social media: Ã¢Â€ÂœWe cannot allow the genocidal zionist [sic] regime to be normalized here in Pittsburgh or anywhere!Ã¢Â€Â

On February 15, anti-Israel studentsÃ‚Â protested an event featuring an October 7 survivor sponsored by Hillel, Chabad, and Students Supporting Israel at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. Protesters stood outside the room where the event took place, chanting slogans like Ã¢Â€ÂœThere is only one solution; Intifada, revolutionÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€ÂœIntifada, Intifada; Long live the Intifada.Ã¢Â€Â

After the protest, the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s SJP chapter released a statement doubling down on its support for terror and its explicit call for the exclusion of Zionists from campus. The KU SJP statement read, in part: Ã¢Â€ÂœIt should be clear: just as Ã¢Â€Â˜israelÃ¢Â€Â™ has no right to exist, Zionism has no right to be on KUÃ¢Â€Â™s campusÃ¢Â€Â¦Just as Palestinians have a right to resist our oppressors in Palestine, so too do we have a right to resist them when they show their faces right here at KU. Here as much as in Palestine, be sure that the resistance will never cease until Palestine is freed from the river to the sea. Glory to the martyrs! Glory to the Resistance! Long live the Intifada!Ã¢Â€Â

On March 6, a Hillel-sponsored event featuring an IDF soldier at The New School in New York, NY wasÃ‚Â forced to relocate multiple times due toÃ‚Â anti-Israel protesters. Protesters harassed Hillel members as they entered and exited the venue and left red-painted handprints on the glass doors of the building.

Two days later,Ã‚Â protesters disrupted an on-campus, Hillel-hosted Shabbat dinner featuring two IDF soldiers at Florida International University in Miami, FL. Protesters were eventually removed from the building, but remained outside the exits, with Jewish students reporting that they wereÃ‚Â harassed and intimidated as they left the event.

Even Hillel-hosted events seeking to facilitate dialogue related to the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been targeted by anti-Israel student activists who are increasingly employing anÃ‚Â anti-normalization approach Ã¢Â€Â” the complete rejection of any cooperation or association with individuals or organizations who accept or support IsraelÃ¢Â€Â™s existence.

A Ã¢Â€ÂœSide-By-SideÃ¢Â€Â discussion at Ithaca College on February 6 featuring an Israeli and Palestinian speaker and hosted by Hillel was protested by Ithaca College Students for Palestine, whoÃ‚Â staged a sit-in outside the campus building where the event took place.

On March 27, three masked individuals stood in front of the Ohio State University Hillel building in Columbus, OHÃ‚Â holding a banner that read Ã¢Â€ÂœOSU Hillel invites you to visit a genocidal state.Ã¢Â€Â The demonstration coincided with a scheduled informational session for an upcoming Ã¢Â€ÂœFact Finders Israel Trip,Ã¢Â€Â a Hillel-run program that facilitates dialogue between Jewish and non-Jewish students via a trip to Israel and the West Bank.Ã‚Â 

Protesters also entered the building apparently intending to disrupt the info session, which was postponed due to the demonstration.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-reddit-help-moderators-confronted-antisemitism,"New York, NY, August 1, 2024 ... A new report released today by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society (CTS) reveals that a group of moderators of Jewish communities on Reddit faced with increased antisemitism on the social media platform reached out to ADL for support. Based on research into these moderatorsÃ¢Â€Â™ experiences, ADL engaged with Reddit, which led the platform to take several important steps to stem instances of antisemitism on the site and to support moderators.

These steps include:

Provide refresher training to safety staff on Reddit policies around hate, including antisemitism.
Include identity communities, including Jewish community representatives, in theirÃ‚Â Partner Communities Program.
StartÃ‚Â Moderator Code of ConductÃ‚Â proceedings on interference with some Jewish communities.
Review safety settings and supported moderators in enabling tools on their subreddits, such as theÃ‚Â Modmail Harassment FilterÃ‚Â and theÃ‚Â Harassment Filter.Ã‚Â 

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe way ADL worked with Reddit to address the antisemitism described by moderators is a great example of a tech company working with civil society to improve their platform and make it a safer place for its users,Ã¢Â€ÂÃ‚Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe are grateful to RedditÃ¢Â€Â™s leadership who took the concerns of their community seriously and acted quickly to make sure the hate and harassment experienced by Jewish users would not be accepted or normalized.Ã¢Â€Â

The alarming wave of hate that Reddit moderators have faced since Oct. 7 is part of an increaseÃ‚Â observed online and offline hate globally. In the U.S., the number ofÃ‚Â antisemitic incidents leapt by 140 percent in 2023 andÃ‚Â 41 percent of Jewish adults reported changing their behavior online in the past year to avoid being recognized as Jewish.

In a subreddit where people shared about their trauma dealing with antisemitism, for example, bad actors purposefully looked for these opportunities to harass users and spread hate. Other moderators explained that they deal with slurs, footage of Oct. 7, hate speech, and blood libel, among other hateful rhetoric and acts.

This has taken a toll on the moderators themselves, not only from having to manage the perpetual hate, but also from having to deal with harassment directed at themselves. So much of their time is spent keeping the space safe that they cannot participate in the communities they love.

Moderators also face steady personal and targeted harassment from users. This antisemitism hasÃ‚Â had a chilling effect on speech for the moderators and those on their subreddits,Ã‚Â and the response to antisemitism reports on the site has stopped at least one moderator from reporting instances of antisemitism.

Ã¢Â€ÂœJewish subreddits provide usersÃ‚Â with a space to talk about their unique experiences, which has taken on an increased importance since Oct. 7. The moderators we spoke with, however, describe a situation where even these safe spaces have become inundated with an antisemitism they constantly have to keep in check,Ã¢Â€Â said DanielÃ‚Â Kelley, Director of Strategy and Operations and Interim Head, ADL Center for Technology and Society. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe challenge for Reddit and all platforms is to continue to address antisemitism and keep online spaces safe for Jewish users. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not enough to only remove violative content- platforms must find ongoing ways to support targeted users on their platform directly and continually educate their staff on what that looks like. Reddit was receptive and proactive when alerted.""

Methodology

ADL was contacted by six Jewish Reddit moderators looking for support handling theÃ‚Â antisemitism on their subreddits. On March 20, 2024, we conducted a 90-minute group interview with these moderators to discuss this antisemitism and the interventions that Reddit has, or has not, taken to support them. The six moderators came from a variety of Jewish-focused subreddits who have, by their own estimate, an average of 78,000 subscribers, and receive approximately 50 posts and 1,400 comments per subreddit per day. All names of the moderators have been anonymized in our report. Minimal reference to their personal information (age, gender, etc.) or to the subreddits they moderate has been made to protect them from harassment.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

The work that the ADL is doing across Europe to raise awareness around antisemitism is so important at this moment in time, and we feel privileged to be able to offer our athletes the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in this educational experience,Ã¢Â€Â said Nathan Servi, Chief Operating Officer at Maccabi GB.

In response to the recent sharp global rise of antisemitic attitudes and antisemitic incidents, Ã¢Â€ÂœWords to ActionÃ¢Â€Â has become a highly sought-after educational program for Jewish youth to understand and effectively address antisemitism, anti-Israel bias, stereotypes, prejudice, and hate speech. As part of theÃ‚Â Words to Action Europe program, ADL has delivered 176 trainings for over 2,700 Jewish youth since 2022.

Thirty educational sessions will be provided to approximately 800 young athletes from 14 countries, including Argentina, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Ã‚Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/hillel-international-adl-ajc-jewish-federations-and-cop-urge-colleges-and,"Following the alarming rise in antisemitic incidents on campus, leading Jewish and educational groups call on college and university administrators to take action ahead of the new school year.

July 31, 2024Ã¢Â€Â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), American Jewish Committee (AJC), the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations (CoP), Hillel International, and Jewish Federations of North America today announced a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at combating antisemitism on campus in the upcoming school year.

This unprecedented time for institutions of higher education across the United States demands a unified response to ensure the safety and full inclusion of Jewish students Ã¢Â€Â“ as well as all students, faculty, and staff. These guidelines provide college and university administrators with clear and proactive ways to support a safer and more inclusive campus environment for Jewish students, and for the entire campus community.

Recommendations include:

Clearly Communicate Campus Rules, Standards, and Policies:Ã‚Â Make clear to students what it means to be a member of the campus community, and ensure students, faculty, and staff are aware of school policies on protests and demonstrations.
Support Jewish Students:Ã‚Â Prevent discrimination, unequivocally denounce antisemitism, ensure inclusivity, and provide antisemitism education and training.
Ensure Campus Safety: Enforce university codes of conduct, maintain clear reporting avenues for antisemitic incidents, ensure campus staff are trained to address violations ofÃ‚Â  campus rules, and reaffirm rejection of BDS and academic boycotts of Israel.
Reaffirm Faculty Responsibilities: Ensure studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ academic freedom and a non-discriminatory learning environment in the classroom. Communicate and enforce policies regarding faculty who threaten to withhold studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ grades if faculty demands are not met, or who cancel mandatory classes.
Prepare for Oct. 7:Ã‚Â Anticipate and mitigate disruptions on the one-year mark of the Hamas attack on Israel, ensuring any protest activities do not interfere with campus operations or Jewish studentsÃ¢Â€Â™ rights.

Ã¢Â€ÂœThe unprecedented surge in antisemitism on college campuses last year was utterly unacceptable, and yet far too many administrations failed to respond effectively,Ã¢Â€Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe insist that all college and university leaders take significant steps to make Jewish students safer.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœDuring the last academic year, countless Jewish students experienced harassment, intimidation, discrimination, and even assaults on campus,Ã¢Â€Â said Adam Lehman, Hillel International President and CEO. Ã¢Â€ÂœAlongside our efforts to build vibrant Jewish communities on campus, we are providing college and university leaders with clear guidance and practical solutions for the steps they need to take to ensure a safer and more welcoming environment for Jewish students. Jewish students and all students deserve a better campus and learning environment this fall.Ã¢Â€Â

During the 2023-2024 academic year, schools saw more than 1,400 antisemitic incidents on college campuses Ã¢Â€Â“ by far the highest number of antisemitic incidents on campus in a single school year ever on record. Following the Oct. 7 attack, aÃ‚Â survey by Hillel and ADL found that 73 percent of Jewish college students and 44 percent of non-Jewish students experienced or witnessed antisemitism on their campuses last fall. A fall 2023Ã‚Â survey by AJC found that 1 in 4 Jewish college/university students felt unsafe at a campus event because they were Jewish.

Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat Jewish students faced on campus last year cannot be allowed to continue into the new academic year,Ã¢Â€Â said AJC CEO Ted Deutch. Ã¢Â€ÂœAll students on campus have the right to attend class, learn and grow without intimidation, harassment and even violence at the hands of fellow students and outside agitators. Colleges and universities must do the work to ensure a university culture of pluralism, fact-based inquiry, and dialogue across difference. They must ensure a campus and societal culture where there is zero tolerance for antisemitism.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¢Â€ÂœOur campuses should be bastions of diversity and the open exchange of ideas rather than be pervaded by fear, intimidation, and discrimination,Ã¢Â€Â said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of Jewish Federations of North America. Ã¢Â€ÂœWith this agenda, Jewish Federations across North America are working to ensure that every community's institutions of higher learning will take action to protect the civil rights of their Jewish students.Ã¢Â€Â

Ã¯Â»Â¿Ã¢Â€ÂœOver the past school year, America saw numerous incidents of harassment against Jewish students, violent protests, and flagrant violations of conduct codes. University officials are neglecting their duty to ensure a safe learning environment for all students,Ã¢Â€Â said William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Ã¢Â€ÂœWe urge them to adopt these recommendations and collaborate with Jewish organizations to protect the safety of Jewish students.Ã¢Â€Â

Additional supporting organizations include Academic Engagement Network, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Jewish Grad Organization, Jewish on Campus, National Council of Jewish Women, Olami, Rabbinical Assembly, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Delta Tau, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and Zeta Beta Tau.

Ã‚Â 

Dear High Commissioner TÃƒÂ¼rk,Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 
We, the undersigned, representing the largest Jewish communities outside of Israel, write to you today regarding United Nations Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese.Ã‚Â  Ms. Albanese has a long record of promoting antisemitic conspiracies and using of hateful and violent language to attack the Jewish State of Israel.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

The most recent example is her July 25th post on the social media platform X, which promoted an image that compared Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, with the comment Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is precisely what I was thinking today.Ã¢Â€Â Making comparisons between Israel and the Nazis is one explicit example of antisemitism in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism and is unambiguously considered antisemitic by the Jewish community.Ã‚Â  Her post trivializes the memory of the Holocaust and the six million Jews killed, promotes antisemitism, and emboldens others to voice their anti-Jewish hate.Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Prior examples of Ms. AlbaneseÃ¢Â€Â™s antisemitic comments and other problematic posts include:Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Repeated comments about how the US government is controlled by a Jewish lobby, a classic antisemitic stereotype about Jews controlling governments.Ã‚Â 

Diminishing the horrific Hamas attack against Israel on October 7th and blaming Israel for HamasÃ¢Â€Â™s atrocities.

Repeatedly defending Hamas and advocating for Palestinian Ã¢Â€Âœresistance,Ã¢Â€Â views which amount to support for violence against Israel and Jews.Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â 

Ms. AlbaneseÃ¢Â€Â™s pattern of antisemitism, her clear bias against Israel, and justification of and even supportÃ‚Â Ã‚Â  for violence stand in direct opposition to the United NationsÃ¢Â€Â™s values of peace and tolerance. She is clearly ill-suited for any official UN role, let alone one that deals with a highly complex and sensitive matter like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

We therefore respectfully request that you initiate a process at the upcoming UN Human Rights Council session in September to remove Ms. Albanese from her Special Rapporteur position.Ã‚Â  As you know, the Human Rights Council has long had a reputation for tolerating antisemitism and bias against Israel.Ã‚Â  If you, as High Commissioner, were to successfully drive a process to have the Human Rights Council withdraw Ms. AlbaneseÃ¢Â€Â™s mandate, that action would contribute to the rehabilitation of the CouncilÃ¢Â€Â™s reputation.Ã‚Â  By the same token, lack of action would further harm the CouncilÃ¢Â€Â™s standing and would add yet another example of toleration of antisemitism within the UN system.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

Ã‚Â 

We look forward to your early reply.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

Sincerely,Ã‚Â

How much time do you think people spend online each day?Ã‚Â 

People are spending a lot of time online lately. On average, people spend 6.5 hours on the internet every day, according to the Global Web Index. Teenagers and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 spend an additional 2.5 hours more time online than those between the ages of 55 and 64. As they spend time online, many people experience online hate and harassment, which can cause stress, fear and harm, especially to those who are members of marginalized identity groups.Ã‚Â 

Because of the time spent online, the online hate and harassment that people face and witness can intrude upon and fundamentally affect their daily lives.",[1],"{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.0}",MEDIUM
