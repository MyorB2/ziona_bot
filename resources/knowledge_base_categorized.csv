ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/confronting-antisemitic-bullying-schools-steps-toward-understanding,"In recent years, antisemitism has been increasing and intensifying in many segments of our daily lives: on the streets, in rhetoric, through the media, in politics, workplaces and in digital spaces.

Schools have not escaped this surge. In 2023, antisemitic incidents at K-12 schools increased by 135% from the previous year to 1,162 incidents overall. Further, FBI data reveals that hate crimes in schools have more than doubled over the past five years; the most frequent victims of these hate crimes are Black, LGBTQ+ and Jewish students. With antisemitism growing in schools, in November 2023 the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights issued a Dear Colleague letter reminding school leaders of their legal obligation to address discrimination against Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Arab, and other students.

As students move through the hallways, classrooms and lunchrooms of our K-12 schools, antisemitism shows up in a variety of ways, including bullying. Bullying is often the way that different forms of bias (e.g., antisemitism, racism, anti-Muslim bias, ableism) target young people in schools.

We define bullying as the repeated actions or threats of action directed toward a person by one or more people who have (or are perceived to have) more power or status than their target in order to cause fear, distress or harm. Unfortunately bullying is common in schools.Â  Bullying can include verbal actions like taunting, teasing and name-calling; social interactions such as exclusion and spreading rumors; and physical actions including hitting, pushing, or breaking or taking someoneâs things. In addition, more than 54% of young people face cyberbullying over their lifetimes, which can take place during the school day, after school or when students go home.

The targets of bullying and cyberbullying are often young people in various marginalized communities, including Jewish students. Much of the bullying we see take place in schools is identity-based bullying, which is bullying related to a personâs identityâtheir religion, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, etc. Because identity-based bullying targets who the student isâa core part of their identityâit can be especially harmful. Antisemitic bullying focuses on a personâs Jewish identity and uses antisemitic actions, language and behaviors to cause fear, distress and harm.

There are a variety of ways that antisemitic bullying shows up in schools and targets Jewish students. Some examples include: writing a swastika on a Jewish studentâs notebook; taunting Jewish students with antisemitic remarks; spewing insults by blaming Jewish students for the war in Gaza; targeting Jewish students using stereotypes, tropes and conspiracy theories; pulling off a Jewish studentâs kippah; directing praise for Hitler or Holocaust âjokesâ and concentration camp references toward Jewish students; and more. Because our online lives often mirror our in-person realities, exclusion, harassment and attacks follow young people home and into their digital lives, making the bullying constant and perpetualâ24/7. Because bullying behavior is repeated over and over and its threat is always looming, there is compounded and ongoing harm caused to those who are targeted.

As young people face antisemitic bullying and prolonged feelings of stress and fear, they will likely be impacted in harmful ways that can interfere with their daily well-being in school, at home and in their community. The negative impact on Jewish students experiencing antisemitic bullying can be emotional (e.g., pessimism, anxiety, depression), physical (e.g., fatigue, nightmares, headaches), behavioral (e.g., clinging, aggression, withdrawing) and academic (e.g., decreased engagement, school avoidance, lower grades).

Here are some suggestions for what schools, educators, community youth programs and others who work with young people can do proactively to address and reduce antisemitic bullying:

Work as a school (or organization) to be proactive. Make sure that your schoolâs policies and procedures regarding bullying, harassment and discrimination are up to date and all staff are aware of their responsibilities. Because antisemitic bullying can often happen in the context of antisemitic school-based incidents, it is important to review policies and practices to empower educators and school administrators to strengthen school responses to school-based incidents.
Be more approachable for students to report bullying to you and other trusted adultsâand take them seriously when they do. Research shows that students are reluctant to report bullying and that reluctance increases with age. Their hesitation stems from their concern that reporting will not improve their situation and in fact, it will make it worse and they may face retaliation.
As an educator, learn about antisemitism, so that you can support Jewish students and teach others. Increase your confidence to recognize, discuss and learn more about antisemitism. Spend time in your classroom discussing antisemitism and how to counteract it and how to address bullying specifically.
Teach students the skills, knowledge and mindset for how to act as allies for when they or their peers experience bullying. Because so much of bullying takes place when adults are not around or watching and students are reluctant to report, young people can act as allies when they face or encounter bullying.
Learn more and teach students about Jewish people, culture, identity and the Jewish experience in its diversity and complexity. Learning about Jewish people and the Jewish experience can have an impact on reducing antisemitism, helping to dispel misconceptions and stereotypes and increasing understanding and empathy.

All students deserve to feel safe at schoolâboth physically and emotionally. In order to help Jewish students feel safe, it is critical that we address and counteract all forms of bullying, including bullying that targets Jewish students and spreads antisemitism.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/numerous-anti-israel-wikipedia-editors-including-instigators-who-targeted,"New York, NY, January 17, 2025 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the disciplinary action taken against multiple editors by the Wikipedia arbitration committee in the wake of a massive effort by anti-Israel editors to spread misinformation and hate across the platform.

Among those topic-banned by Wikipedia from the Israel-Palestine discussion were Iskandar323, Selfstudier, Nableezy, Levivich and Nishidani â all of whom ADL has identified as being part of a bad-faith campaign in an attempt to undermine the credibility of ADL.

Another editor, Ivana, who also participated in the campaign against ADL and was caught advocating for editorial changes offline during the bad-faith campaign, was previously banned outright from editing the online encyclopedia.

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

âWeâre pleased that the Wikipedia arbitration board has taken disciplinary action against some editors who, in our view, have spread malicious, false and biased information about Zionism and Israel across the platform. Itâs worth noting that several of the chief instigators of the campaign against ADL are among those now facing topic bans or outright bans for their behavior.

âIn light of this, it is now imperative for Wikipedia to begin work immediately to undo the harm caused by these rogue but prolific editors who literally have wreaked havoc across the platform, causing untold harm to potentially hundreds of entries about Israel, the Oct. 7 massacre, Zionism and topics relating to antisemitism.

âAs we have said before, Wikipedia needs to wake up to the reality that this is a systemic problem across the platform that needs immediate action. There is still a lot more that must be done to ensure that Wikipedia can live up to its policy around the encyclopedia holding a neutral point of view.â

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms ofÂ antisemitism andÂ bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact. A global leader in combating antisemitism,Â countering extremism and battling bigotry wherever and whenever it happens, ADL works to protect democracy and ensure a just and inclusive society for all.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/tommy-robinson-five-things-know,"1. Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is a British anti-Muslim bigot with ties to far-right groups in Europe.

Stephen Yaxley-Lennon is a formerÂ soccer hooligan who, around 2009, adopted the name Tommy Robinson from another infamous soccer hooligan associated with a football club in his hometown of Luton. In October 2024, he began serving an 18-month prison term for contempt of court related to an anti-Muslim libel lawsuit he lost in 2021.

In 2004, Robinson joined the fascist British National Party (BNP), but left after one year, later claiming he didnât know the group held white supremacist views. In 2009, he founded the English Defence League (EDL), an anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant organization made up of hundreds of his fellow former soccer hooligans. RobinsonÂ said he formed the group to fight radical Islam in the streets of Great Britain.

EDL, now defunct, opposed Muslim immigration to the U.K. and vilified the Muslims already living there. The group held frequent, violent protests against the Muslim community. In 2011, RobinsonÂ declared, âThe Islamic community will feel the full force of the EDL if we see any of our citizens killed, maimed or hurt on British soil ever again.â Robinson left the EDL by 2013 due to infighting and other internal problems but remained an anti-Muslim activist.Â Hope Not Hate, a British organization that monitors extremism,Â reported that in 2016, Robinson tweeted, âIâd personally send every adult male Muslim that has come into the EU over the past 12 months back tomorrow if I could.âÂ In early 2017, Robinson became a reporter for the Canadian far-right website Rebel Media, where he produced anti-Muslim videos.

Robinson was arrested in May 2018 after livestreaming outside a trial involving Muslim men who were charged with sexually grooming young British girls (see below for more information). In addition, prosecutorsÂ alleged that Robinsonâs social media posts influencedÂ Darren Osborne, who deliberately drove a van into a group of Muslims near a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, in June 2017, killing one person and injuring several others. In a separate case in November 2018, Robinson publicly accused a Muslim teen, who was a refugee, of being aÂ violent school bully. That teen successfully sued Robinson for libel in 2019 and won in 2021. Robinsonâs current prison term stems from that case; he reiterated his claims against the teenager, even after being found guilty of libel.

2. Robinsonâs anti-immigrant rhetoric and protests in the U.K. attracted the attention and support of anti-immigrant activists in the U.S.

The EDLâs anti-immigrant views, mostly directed at Muslims, mobilized Britons and attracted support from xenophobic groups in the U.S. At its peak and under Robinsonâs leadership, EDL attracted thousands of people, including neo-Nazis and other white supremacists, to anti-Muslim demonstrations, becoming what Media Matters referred to in aÂ 2010 media report as âthe most significant far-right street movement in the UK since the National Front in the 1970s.â Hope Not HateÂ reported that EDL created alliances with other anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim groups in Europe and the United States, âincluding neo-conservative organisations and the anti-Islam wing of the Tea Party movement.â

Pamela Geller, an anti-Muslim activist who founded the groupÂ Stop Islamization of America in 2009, repeatedly praised EDL, and in 2010 wrote in the conservative publicationÂ American ThinkerÂ that ""Free people should support the English Defence League in its efforts to stand for England and the West against the belligerent invaders and Islamic imperialists."" Ann Coulter, another American anti-immigration activist, also praised the EDL and Robinson inÂ a 2013 article in the Daily Caller, a conservative publication.

Former Fox News personality Bill OâReillyÂ gave Robinson a platform to express his views in a 2013 interview, in which Robinson described his anti-Muslim activity as a âfight for Christianity, fight for our children's future, fight for our culture, and fight for our country's identity, which is completely under attack."" After serving time in prison for mortgage fraud in 2014,Â Robinson joined the German anti-immigrant group Pegida, establishing a local branch in England, where he tried (unsuccessfully) to replicate their tactics and strategies.Â 

3. Robinsonâs anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views have drawn support from far-right figures in the U.S.

Far-right figures in the U.S. have expressed admiration and support for Robinson. In 2018, when Robinson was jailed on a contempt of court charge for livestreaming outside a trial of Muslim men charged with grooming British girls (see below), tens of thousands of Britons signed petitions for his release. In addition, many American far-right figures claimed (falsely) that Robinson was arrested because of his comments about Muslims and that British officials violated his free speech rights. Robinson received support in 2018 from a range of figures. Donald Trump, Jr., tweeted, âDonât let America follow in those footsteps.âÂ Steve Bannon, a former advisor to the Trump administration, told a reporter, âYou lose guys like Tommy Robinson youâre not going to have a country.â Daniel Pipes, the head of the conservative think tank Middle East Forum and David Horowitz of the right-wing David Horowitz Foundation, also vocally supported Robinson.

U.S. RepresentativeÂ Paul Gosar (R-AZ) also bolstered Robinson and made disparaging remarks about Muslims at a pro-Robinson rally in London in July 2018 which attracted thousands of supporters as part of the âFree Tommyâ movement. Afterwards, Pipes and HorowitzÂ invited Robinson to the U.S., while GosarÂ invited Robinson to address the Congressional Conservative Opportunity Society. RobinsonÂ was denied a visa afterÂ dozens of British MembersÂ of Parliament and organizations (including the ADL) warned about the potential rise in extremism and violenceÂ among his supporters in the U.K. if he was allowed into the United States.

4. Robinson has a laundry list of criminal activity, including using a false identity, fraud and contempt of court.

Robinson has been arrested and imprisoned numerous times in Great Britain. Most recently, authoritiesÂ jailed Robinson in October 2024 for 18 months for contempt of court after violating an injunction forbidding him to show âSilenced,â a self-produced documentaryÂ that repeated libelous charges Robinson originally made against a Muslim refugee teen in 2018. Robinson publicly labeled the teen aÂ âviolent school bully,âÂ Â and was found guilty of libel.

In 2021, a five-year order of protection was entered against RobinsonÂ for stalking a female British journalist who was doing an expose on his handling of supportersâ contributions. In January 2014, Robinson was jailed for 18 months for mortgage fraud. In January 2013, Robinson was sentenced to jail time for trying to enter the U.S.Â with a false identity document. In July 2011, Robinson was arrested and handed a 12-month community rehabilitation order after he was convicted of leadingÂ a brawl involving more than 100 football fans.Â 

5. Robinsonâs recent activity demonstrates his ongoing anti-Muslim bigotry.

In January 2022, RobinsonÂ created a series of documentaries about the sexual grooming of young girls in Britain. About 1,500 people attended the screening for the first documentary, and he followed up with four more which did not attract as much attention.

While a court injunctionÂ prevented him from showing his film, âSilenced,â Robinson moved to Spain in 2023 and subsequentlyÂ showed a version of the film, released by MICE Media, at a meeting with the Danish Parliament in Copenhagen. The meeting was hosted by the Danish Peopleâs Party, a right-wing populist party that focuses on immigration, and The Free Press Society. He also gave numerous interviews about the film, where he repeated his false claims.

Robinson returned to the U.K. in late 2023. After the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, RobinsonÂ called on his supporters to protect British monuments from pro-Palestinian marchers during a protest held on Armistice Day (November 11). Robinson, however, allegedly fled the scene when confrontations between his supporters and the police turned violent.Â 

In July 2024, RobinsonÂ screened his film âSilencedâ to thousands of supporters in Londonâs Trafalgar Square, declaring that he would not be silenced. In October 2024,Â he received his jail sentence for violating the injunction to not spread false allegations about the Muslim teen.","[1, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/hate-and-harassment-present-almost-half-online-multiplayer-gaming-sessions,"New York, NY, January 16, 2025, â¦Â  Hate and harassment was recorded in almost half of online multiplayer game sessions tested with a range of religious, ethnic and national identity-based usernames, shows new research conducted by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society. Examples of hate and harassment includedÂ racial slurs, trash-talking or disrupted play.

Identity-based harassment was present in one-third of play sessions across the four games (Valorant, Counterstrike 2, Overwatch 2Â and Fortnite) played by participants (student researchers) using usernames âProud2bJewishâ, âProud2bMuslimâ, âProud2bChineseâ, âProud2bIsraeliâ, and âProud2bMexicanâ. In some sessions, people were not just harassed based on their specific username but also encountered instances of general identity-based harassment or harassment toward multiple other identities.


Â 
Â 

âThe unacceptable normalization of harassment in online games is not only concerning because of how widespread it is and because so many teens and young people are exposed to hate in these spaces, but also because of the intensity of the verbal abuse weâve recorded,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âHearing phrases such as âgas the Jewsâ, calling people the ân-wordâ or seeing a player named Hitler is not inconsequential; itâs pure, unabashed hatred andÂ gaming companiesÂ need to step up and make it stop.â
Â 


Among the four games tested, Valorant and Counterstrike 2 stood out for resulting in some type of harassment in about two-thirds of the game sessions; half had identity-based harassment. Overwatch 2 and Fortnite, in contrast, showed the least amount of identity-based harassment (8 percent for Overwatch 2 and 20 percent for Fortnite). In Valorant and Counterstrike 2, over half (57 percent) of the play sessions with the âProud2bJewishâ username included some level of Jewish identity-based harassment.

ADL has been investigating hate and harassmentâas well as prosocial behaviorâin online multiplayer games since 2019. Six out of ten people (ages 5-90) in the U.S. play video games, according to theÂ Entertainment Software Association, and there are over 3 billion players around the world.Â In 2023, ADL found that 76 percent of adult participants (aged 18-45) and 75 percent of teens (ages 10-17) in online multiplayer games reported experiencing any harassment in online games.Â 

âAs increasing numbers of people engage in online gaming spaces, we need to find ways to minimize disruptive behavior, hate and harassment,â said Daniel Kelley, Interim Head & Director of Strategy and Operations, ADL Center for Technology and Society. âThe gaming industry and government have a responsibility to make sure people feel safe while engaging in competitive online gaming. As shown in our research, these spaces can lead to prosocial behavior, which should not be overshadowed by the rampant abuse weâre recording. At the same time, itâs alarming that one of the main responses across all participants in the study was that they expected there to be even more hate than there was.â

The report also included detailed recommendations for the gaming industry, government, researchers and caregivers. The full list is available at the end of the report.

Recommendations for industry:

Implement industry-wide policy and design practices to better address how hate targets specific identities.
Incentivize and promote prosocial behavior through design.
Rather than reducing Trust & Safety headcount, as many companies have done in 2023 and 2024, companies must expand resources in this important area.
Improve reporting systems and support for targets of harassment.
Strengthen content-moderation tools for in-game voice chat.
Release regular, consistent transparency reports on hate and harassment.

Recommendations for government:

In February 2024, ADL released its annual report Hate is No Game: Hate and Harassment in Online Games 2023Â in which the need for governments to take a more active role in fighting hate and harassment in games was highlighted:

Prioritize transparency legislation in digital spaces and include online multiplayer games.
Enhance access to justice for victims of online abuse.
Establish a National Gaming Safety Task Force.
Resource research efforts.

Methodology
Â 
In late 2023 through summer 2024, a diverse group of students, recent graduates, and young adults participated as a game players in four online competitive first-person shooter games (Valorant, Counterstrike 2, Fortnite, and Overwatch 2) with the usernames Proud2BJewish,Â Proud2BMuslim, Proud2BIsraeli, Proud2BMexican, Proud2BChinese. The students recorded their almost 250 hours of cumulative gameplay and experiences after each hour of gameplay.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/terrorgram-collective-international-terrorists-promoting-violence-and-white,"On January 13, 2025, the United States Department of State designated the Terrorgram Collective and three of its foreign leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), formally including Terrorgram among other international terrorist groups. Â 

Terrorgram is a decentralized network of white supremacist, neo-Nazi and accelerationist groups and individuals connected primarily through the encrypted social networking app Telegram, with the collective goal of promoting stochastic terrorism and inspiring individuals to conduct either group-oriented or âlone wolfâ terror attacks. The network first began to take shape in 2019 and 2020, in the wake of Australian white supremacist Brenton Tarrantâs deadly terror attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Terrorgram members seek to convince more white supremacists to conduct similar violent attacks in service of their accelerationist ideology.Â 

Key Facts to Know:Â Â 

The white supremacist ideology behind Terrorgram promotes violent actions and sabotage to achieve goals.

Accelerationism, the main ideology promoted by Terrorgram, is a belief system within some segments of the white supremacist movement that promotes violent actions and sabotage as means to accelerate a perceived inevitable collapse of society, allowing followers to establish a white ethno-state in the aftermath. Since its emergence and spread in the late 2010s, white supremacist accelerationism has inspired multiple terrorist plots and attacks in countries around the world. Â Adherents of the ideology generate propaganda, shared primarily online, that venerates past far-right killersâoften referring to them as âsaintsââand encourages people to emulate them, suggesting that they too would be remembered as saints after committing their violent acts.

Terrorgram propaganda is designed to inspire readers to commit extreme violence against marginalized groups. Â 

The Terrorgram Collective is an inner circle of Terrorgram propagandists, who create and disseminate zine-style digital publications called the Terrorgram Publications, which contain instructional manuals and creative works of fiction with distinctive layouts and design. They are designed to inspire readers to commit acts of extreme violence against people and acts of sabotage and destruction against critical infrastructure targets. The publications frequently demonize Jews, Muslims, people of color, immigrants, and the LGTBQ+ community, and particularly glorify acts of violence, such as mass shootings, committed against these communities. Â 

Terrorgram Collective and their publications have directly inspired multiple terror acts and plots in the U.S. and abroad.

The Terrorgram Collective and their publications have directly inspired multiple recent terror attacks and plots both in the United States as well as abroad, including a shooting outside an LGBTQ+ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, in 2022; a mass stabbing attack at a mosque in EskiÅehir, Turkey, in 2024; and an alleged plot to destroy an energy facility in East Brunswick, New Jersey, in 2024.

U.S. authorities designated the Terrorgram Collective and its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).

On September 5, 2024, federal authorities arrested Matthew Allison of Boise, Idaho, and Dallas Humber of Elk Grove, California, for their alleged leadership roles in the Terrorgram Collective, charging them with soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. Â When the U.S. Department of State designated the Terrorgram Collective as SDGTs in January 2025, they specifically designated three of their foreign leadersâCiro Daniel Amorim Ferreira of Brazil, Noah Licul of Croatia, and Hendrik-Wahl Muller of South Africa--as SDGTs, as well.","[2, 3, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.2, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/los-angeles-wildfires-trigger-conspiracy-theories-and-hate,"As devastating wildfires continue to decimate sections of Los Angeles, California, extremists and conspiracy theorists are spreading familiar falsehoods, blaming the blaze on common scapegoats such as diversity initiatives, Jews and nefarious government âfalse flags.â

Fires that began in the Pacific Palisades area on January 7, 2025, are now part of a broader set of blazes across the city. Officials believe the fires were caused primarily by drought conditions, high winds and the cumulative effects of climate change.

Despite these facts, extremists and promoters of hate continue to spread false narratives about the fires to target marginalized groups and sow distrust â a tactic theyâve deployed following disasters and extreme weather phenomena for years.Â 
Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #1: Fires were caused by prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion

One of the most prevalent false narratives suggests the fires are linked to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

Many targeted Los Angeles fire chief Kristin Crowley, the first female and openly LGBTQ+ person in her position, suggesting â without evidence â that she favored DEI initiatives over disaster preparedness, or hired unqualified candidates in the name of diversity. Â 

On Telegram, one Proud Boys chapter shared a meme featuring Crowley that read, â0% contained 100% DEI.â Another Proud Boys chapter posted an image of flames near Sunset Boulevard with the caption, âWoke has consequences.â

Similar theories also circulated after the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Extremists often blame disasters on factors like DEI and female leadership, a narrative that allows them to promote racism, misogyny and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric while denying the impact of climate change. Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #2: Jews are responsible forâ and deserve to suffer because of â the wildfires

Invoking classic tropes about disproportionate Jewish influence, antisemitic figures on social media blamed Jews at large for the Los Angeles wildfires. Â 

On X, antisemitic conspiracy theorist Stew Peters reshared a post that referred to Stewart and Lynda Resnick â owners of the Wonderful Company â as a âJewish billionaire coupleâ with the caption, âIt really is one group causing all the worldâs problems.â Rumors about the Resnicks have falsely accused them of âcontrollingâ the water in California, suggesting they contributed to water shortages that have made it harder to contain the fires.Â 

Stew Peters alluding to âone group causing all the worldâs problemsâ in post mentioning Resnick couple. Source: X

On Telegram, antisemitic conspiracy theorist Ali Alexander asked why Jews were not fighting fires or acting as âpublic servantsâ and questioned Jewish ownership of the insurance companies that are denying claims, implying that Jewish people act solely out of self-interest, even at the expense of others. While homeowners affected by the fire have indeed struggled with getting adequate insurance coverage, the notion that the companies in question are all controlled by Jews is based in antisemitic tropes about Jewish control and greed.Â 

Others expressed glee over the fires, specifically pointing out impacted areas with large Jewish populations. On Telegram, Christopher Pohlhaus, leader of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, shared a post alluding to the destruction of âexpensive Jewish neighborhoods,â simultaneously promoting a misleading (and debunked) GAI image showing the iconic Hollywood sign in flames.

Christopher Pohlhaus sharing a post with GAI image, referencing âexpensive Jewish neighborhoods.â Source: TelegramÂ 

Some even suggested that Jews brought the destruction upon themselves after making God angry. On X, one antisemitic influencer shared images of the Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center, which burned down in the blaze, stating, âGod is mad at the jews [sic].â On Telegram, accelerationist platform The American Futurist shared similar sentiments, claiming the fires âare a divine act against our jewish [sic] overlords and they deserve it.âÂ 

FALSE NARRATIVE #3: Israelâs war in Gaza caused the fires

Anti-Zionist influencers and groups are blaming Israel as a key catalyst for the wildfires. Â 

For example, on X, far right and anti-Zionist influencer Jackson Hinkle suggested that U.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has taken away from the Los Angeles Fire Departmentâs ability to combat the fires; his post has garnered over 26K likes. Similar narratives followed the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in 2024, when false claims suggested that FEMA had insufficient funds for hurricane relief due to U.S. aid towards Israel.

Anti-Zionist groups including Code Pink and certain chapters of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) attempted to draw explicit connections between Israelâs war in Gaza and the Los Angeles wildfires. On Instagram, these groups suggested that Israelâs military actions are a form of ecocide, meaning that Israelâs actions in Gaza are contributing disproportionately to global warming or that aid to Israel means the U.S. government doesnât have adequate funds to fight the fires and climate change generally.

While there is evidence that armed conflict impacts climate change, singling out Israel speaks to an agenda of demonizing and scapegoating Israel â rather than highlighting the actual climate crisis. Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #4: The wildfires are the product of an âinside jobâ by Hollywood or the government

Purveyors of mis- and disinformation are leveraging the Los Angeles wildfires to spread âfalse flagâ conspiracy theories. Â 

On X, Stew Peters argued that these âgeo-engineered firesâ are a deliberate weaponization of weather modification by the government, which he alleges is âtrying to kill us.â Far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones echoed similar claims, blaming the fires on âA Larger Globalist Plot To Wage Economic Warfare [sic].â

This narrative also surfaced following the Maui wildfires in 2023, which conspiracy theorists similarly blamed on âdirected energy weaponsâ and government-controlled weather. Posts on X mentioning âdirected energy weaponsâ have increased considerably since the fires began, with nearly 47K mentions on the platform since January 7.

Others claimed the fires were set deliberately to cover up evidence of prominent Angelenosâ nefarious activity. QAnon believers claimed that Hunter Bidenâs home was destroyed in the fires â an event they called âconvenientââ and that the destruction was a deliberate attempt to cover up crimes. Â While Bidenâs home was indeed in the path of the fires, the scale of damage is not yet clear and there is no indication that it was deliberately targeted.

Similar theories suggested that the fires were coordinated to cover up evidence of sex trafficking in Hollywood, pointing out fires near the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, confusing that location with the Getty Museum. The latter is frequently cited by QAnon and âSave The Childrenâ conspiracy theorists, who for years have promoted the unfounded claim that thousands of children are being held in tunnels under the museum.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/46-adults-worldwide-hold-significant-antisemitic-beliefs-adl-poll-finds,"The survey shows that anti-Jewish sentiments are at an all-time high globally, revealing areas where governments must take action to tackle antisemitic hate.

New York, NY, January 14, 2025 ... Nearly half of all people worldwide hold elevated levels of antisemitic attitudes, according to the latest Global 100 survey conducted by ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and coordinated with Ipsos and other research partners. The survey found that 46 percent of the worldâs adult population â an estimated 2.2 billion people â harbor deeply entrenched antisemitic attitudes, more than double compared to ADLâs first worldwide survey a decade ago and the highest level on record since ADL started tracking these trends globally.

First launched in 2014, the ADL Global 100 remains the worldâs most extensive study of antisemitic attitudes globally. For the latest survey, over 58,000 adults from 103 countries and territories were surveyed, representing 94 percent of the global adult population.

The survey also found that 20 percent of respondents worldwide have not heard about the Holocaust. Less than half (48 percent) recognize the Holocaustâs historical accuracy, which falls to 39 percent among 18- to 34-year-olds, highlighting a worrying demographic trend. Respondents younger than 35 also have elevated levels of antisemitic sentiments (50 percent), 13 percentage points higher than respondents over 50.

Despite the alarming findings about antisemitic attitudes and Holocaust awareness, Global 100 data highlights areas where governments can take action to begin to reverse these trends. Governments can count on the support of an encouraging majority (59%) of respondents globally who recognize that hate towards Jews is a serious problem in the world. This also holds true for a majority of respondents across all seven geographical regions, age groups, education levels, and political orientations.

âAntisemitism is nothing short of a global emergency, especially in a post-October 7 world. We are seeing these trends play out from the Middle East to Asia, from Europe to North and South America,â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âNegative attitudes towards Jews are an important pillar that ADL uses to assess overall levels of antisemitism within a country, and our findings are deeply alarming. Itâs clear that we need new government interventions, more education, additional safeguards on social media, and new security protocols to prevent antisemitic hate crimes. This fight requires a whole-of-society approach â including government, civil society and individuals and now is the time to act.â

The Global 100 Index Score represents the percentage of respondents who answered âdefinitely trueâ or âprobably trueâ to six or more of the 11 negative stereotypes about Jews that were tested. Three quarters (76%) of respondents inÂ the Middle East and North Africa believe most of the 11 tropes to be true. Around half of the respondents in Asia (51%), Eastern Europe (49%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (45%) harbor high levels of antisemitic attitudes. The Americas (24%), Western Europe (17%), and Oceania (20%) have relatively lower levels of antisemitic attitudes, yet still around one in five adults harbor these sentiments.

According to the survey, the countries and territories with the highest Index Scores include the West Bank and Gaza (97%), Kuwait (97%), and Indonesia (96%), while those with the lowest Index Scores are Sweden (5%), Norway (8%), Canada (8%), and the Netherlands (8%).

âAntisemitic tropes and beliefs are becoming alarmingly normalized across societies worldwide. This dangerous trend is not just a threat to Jewish communitiesâitâs a warning to us all. Even in countries with the lowest levels of antisemitic attitudes globally, weâve seen many antisemitic incidents perpetrated by an emboldened small, vocal and violent minority. This is a wake-up call for collective action, and we are committed to continuing our work with our partners around the world to confront and mitigate this deeply ingrained antisemitism,â said Marina Rosenberg, ADL Senior Vice President for International Affairs.

In addition to the 11 Index questions, the survey asked other questions related to Jews, as well as attitudes towards Israel and engagement with Israeli people and businesses. While sentiments toward Israel are mixed, more than seven in ten respondents believe their country should have diplomatic relationships with Israel (71%) and welcome tourists from Israel (75%). Notably, over two thirds of respondents (67%) do not want their country to boycott Israeli products and businesses.

The survey was conducted via telephone, face-to-face, and online using nationally representative probability sampling in each country or territory and has a margin of error ofÂ Â±4.4% for sample size 500 (the vast majority of countries) andÂ Â±3.2% for sample size 1,000. Fieldwork and data collection were conducted and coordinated by Ipsos in all countries outside of the Middle East and North Africa region. Data collection for countries in the Middle East and North Africa region were conducted and coordinated by GDCC, Ronin, and Catalyze Global Research. All interviews were conducted between July 23 and November 13, 2024.

Among the Global 100 surveyâs key findings:

Alarmingly, younger respondents worldwideÂ show a greater prevalence of antisemitic attitudes. For example, 40% of those under age 35 affirm that âJews are responsible for most of the worldâs warsâ while it is 29% for those over 50, a remarkable 11 percentage point difference.
23% of respondents worldwide express favorable opinions toward the Palestinian terror group Hamas, which increases to 29% among respondents younger than 35.
Only 16% of the respondents in the Middle East and North Africa and 23% in Sub-Saharan Africa recognize the historical accuracy of the Holocaust.

The fight against antisemitism requires countries to adopt and implement a whole-of-society strategy that involves all levels of government, corporations, academia, civil society, and the public. While no one action or policy can end antisemitism, ADL urges governments, as well as international and non-governmental organizations, to adopt and implement theÂ Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism, just as scores of governments and organizations around the world have already done to mitigate the threat and protect Jewish communities.

Negative attitudes toward Jews are one part of how ADL assesses levels of antisemitism. ADL also accounts for the number and nature of antisemitic incidents annually, polls of Jewish communities about their experiences with antisemitism, government policies, and other factors.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/palestine-news-network-pnn-five-things-know,"1. Overview: Palestine News Network (PNN) is a network of people who harass strangers, often Jews, prodding them about their stance on Palestine. The group also expresses support for anti-Israel terror and violence.Â Â 

Individuals associated with PNN have a history of entering neighborhoods with significant Jewish populations, or approaching those attending Jewish or Israel-related events, where they shoot videos that walk the line between âinterviewâ and provocation.

PNN also posts videos or other content celebrating the death of Israelis, the October 7 terror attacks, news of terror attacks in Israel, and expressing support for terror groups like Hamas and dictators, such as the former leader of Syria Bashar al Assad.

PNN has also posted in support of Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan, an 18-year-old Egyptian national suspected of plotting a mass-casualty attack targeting the Israeli Consulate in New York. In December 2024, Iranian backed outletÂ HispanTV published a puff piece interview about the group as a part of a segment on âalternative voices for Palestine.â

2. Leadership: Ramsey Aburdene and David Wolf, who founded PNN in the aftermath of the October 7th terror attacks, routinely celebrate violence targeting Israel.

Ramsey Aburdene, who goes by Abu Rahss on social media, is an aspiring rapper and the founder of Forest Hills Tenleytown Music Group (FHTMG), a music production company. Approximately 10 years ago, he produced a hip-hop music video in North Korea. He also uses the FHTMG Instagram to promote PNN. A 2014 article in The GuardianÂ described Aburdene as anÂ investment banker, though more recent publications do not refer to him in this way.

Aburdene explicitly supports the October 7 terror attacks and terror leaders such as Yahya Sinwar, and says heâs told people for years to âstop condemning Hamas.â

Picture of Ramsey Aburdene (forefront) in a music video. (Screenshot/YouTube)

Â 

Aburdene has also posted antisemitic content on Facebook. In February 2024, he posted a photo of a person wearing a keffiyeh being cut up by a knife stylized as the Jewish Star of David (and a fork stylized as an American flag).

David Wolf is a Jewish man from New Jersey and an extreme anti-Zionist. He notably had his Star of David tattooed over with a Palestinian flag and often joins Aburdene at events. Wolf posted that they tried (unsuccessfully) to enter the November 2024 Stand Together event in Washington, D.C., honoring the first anniversary of the October 7 terror attacks, which they referred to as the âStand Together Nuremberg bash.âÂ  Â 

Wolf celebrates Hamas leadership, such as spokesperson Abu Obeida and former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and lauds Hezbollah attacks.

A post from Aburdene's Facebook page depicting Hamas terrorists with the text, âNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, itâs the only thing that ever has,â published on October 10, 2023. (Screenshot/ Facebook)

Â 

Additional leaders and supporters include Dr. Pressure, also known as Abdulrahman Abed, of Los Angeles, a frequent, vocal and enthusiastic PNN booster who occasionally assists with filming. He has posted on his Instagram that âthere is absolutely no such thing as an âinnocent Israeli,ââ and claimed that Israel was the mastermind behind 9/11.

An Instagram post by David Wolf reading âHappy Veterans Dayâ with an image of Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida, November 2024. (Screenshot/Instagram)

Â 

Another PNN associate, Essa Ejelat, of New York, uses the names âPNN.virtualâ and âPalestinians_united2,â to harass Israelis on video chats. Yoseph Haddad, an Arab Israeli and pro-Israel activist, accused Ejelat of assaulting him at a protest at Columbia in April 2024. Ejelat also has been arrested at least twice for his alleged unlawful behavior at protests.Â 

3.Â Tactics: PNN targets events and people they consider âpro-Israel,â including survivors of the 10/7 terror attacks

PNN associates have approached survivors of the Nova Music Festival, which was targeted on October 7, 2023, particularly at U.S. memorials for those killed. They were at the Los Angeles Nova Exhibition in November 2024, asking attendees if they supported âthe killing of babiesâ and chanting, âFree Palestine.âÂ  They harassed a Nova survivor outside the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles in December 2024, suggesting that he was lying about being shot at the festival. In a Twitter post, PNN describes Nova as happening ""right outside the Gaza Concentration Camp.â

In May 2024, in Washington D.C., Aburdene approached U.S. Congressman Brian Mast (R-FL), a U.S. Army veteran and staunch supporter of Israel, asking where his legs went and if he had a red triangle âgo over his head,â a reference to a Hamas symbol used in its propaganda videos to show an Israeli military target. Mast lost both of his legs in combat in Afghanistan.

In Los Angeles in December 2024, PNN approached two men, one of whom was wearing a âfree the hostagesâ yellow pin and badgered them about their stance âon Palestine.â In the edited video of the encounter, PNN briefly flashes an inverted red triangle over the hostage pin. (Screenshot/TikTok)

Â 

PNN associates also harass attendees at pro-Israel events. In December 2024, PNN protested a Friends of IDF gala fundraiser in Los Angeles, filming individuals and calling attendees âbaby killers.â Aburdene filmed himself harassing an elderly couple getting out of a car to attend an event at the Israeli embassy in Washington D.C., saying âIsrael is going down the tubes, just like you two.â The post is dated November 29, 2024.Â 

What they are most notorious for, however, is approaching people at outdoor restaurants or patios to ask them about Palestine.Â  In November 2024, in Beverly Hills, California, PNN associates filmed themselves yelling that Israel is a âa Rothschild state,â not a Jewish state. They also focused on someone who was trying to eat, yelling at him that he is a baby killer and war criminal and has a âtriangle on top of his head.â

4. Network: PNN content is shared by anti-Zionist activists around the world.

Anti-Zionist activists including prominent âanti-imperialist journalistâ Benjamin Rubenstein shared PNNâs interaction with U.S. Congressman Brian Mast. Other well-known anti-Israel personalities have shared PNN content, including JVP Rabbinical Council member Rabbi David Mivasair, and Maram Susli, better known by her X handle âSyrian Girl,â a 9/11 âtrutherâ who is a known source of disinformation about Syria, whitewashing former Syrian president Bashar al Assadâs numerous crimes against humanity.

Antisemitic conspiracy theorist and UK-based rapper Lowkey and notorious disinformation source Sulaiman Ahmed have also reposted PNN content.

The group has drawn criticism from pro-Israel advocates as well as anti-Zionists, who feel their tactics are overly aggressive.

5. Online impact and income streams: PNN accounts are frequently (and often only briefly) deplatformed by mainstream social media platforms.Â 

In an interview on June 27, 2024, Aburdene noted, âI had several ... Tik Toksâ¦ this is my fourth one and I just started this year in Instagram. They just deleted my second one this year so I'm on my third Instagram....â In an Instagram post showing PNNâs alleged metrics on TikTok, they claimed that between October 10-December 15, 2024, their posts racked up over 30 million views. They also claimed the groupâs TikTok, created around September 2024, was the ninth one theyâve had to make; in December 2024, PNN announced that account had also been banned. Numerous personal accounts stand in when official PNN accounts are removed.Â 

PNN claims not to make any money from its social media.Â  The Instagram page âGasrow, LLCâ previously sold PNN merchandise on their website, and continues to do so on a TikTok shop. They claim all proceeds go to Gaza.

Abed (Dr. Pressure LA) has PNN subscriptions listed on his TikTok pages, which range in cost from around $5 to as high as $89. It is not clear how many people subscribe to these options or if Abed shares that money with PNN. The subscription includes virtual PNN âstickers,â and increased access to PNN creators.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-deeply-concerned-about-metas-trust-and-safety-changes,"New York, NY, January 7, 2025 ... ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) expressed deep concern today about Metaâs policy announcement in terms of their commitment to addressing antisemitism and hate.

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

âIt is mind blowing how one of the most profitable companies in the world, operating with such sophisticated technology, is taking significant steps back in terms of addressing antisemitism, hate, misinformation and protecting vulnerable & marginalized groups online. The only winner here is Metaâs bottom line and as a result, all of society will suffer.""


The ADL Center for Technology and Society further commented on the changes:

Meta indicates that outside of some specific forms of harm (terrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams) it will not do proactive enforcement of their policies and will rely on user reporting. OurÂ recent report cardÂ shows however that Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram) responded to exactly zero cases of antisemitic content when reported as average users.
Â 
Meta must significantly reform their average user reporting process unless they intend to completely abdicate their responsibility to address antisemitism and hate at a time when it is surging online and offline.
Â 
Moreover, it is dangerous that Meta will be âgetting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and genderâ.Â Our research showsÂ that LGBTQ+ users, especially transgender users, receive the most harassment of any marginalized groups and that Facebook is the platform where users are harassed the most overall regardless of their identity. It is one thing to discuss policy, but Meta should focus their attention on prioritizing the protection of marginalized users, not opening the floodgates for attacks based on identity.
Â 
Finally, it's unclear the factual basis for Metaâs change toward âcommunity notesâ vs fact checking to address misinformation. OurÂ recent studyÂ on hateful misinformation and elections on social media shows the dangers of tech companies rolling back approaches to misinformation.
Â 
If all of this is the direction Meta is heading in 2025, it is a bad sign of what is to come for Jews and all marginalized people on their platforms.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/deadly-new-orleans-attack-fuels-conspiracy-theories-about-immigrants-israel,"The deadly New Yearâs attack in New Orleans, Louisiana, left a city reeling and social media awash in hateful lies and conspiracy theories about immigrants, Israel and a government cover-up.Â 

Â 

In the early morning of January 1, 2025, 42-year-old Houston, Texas resident Shamsud-Din Jabbar, drove his car into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least fourteen people and injuring dozens more before he was shot and killed by police. While law enforcement is still investigating his motive, police reportedly found an ISIS flag in the truck and Jabbar, an Army veteran, wore military gear, including camouflage and body armor.â¯

Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #1: The suspect was a new immigrant who entered the U.S. via the Southern border

Early reports fueled by non-credible anonymous sources stated that the suspect had crossed into the U.S. via the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, two days before the attack. While law enforcement confirmed hours later that Jabbar was a U.S. citizen and Texas resident, this false narrative was weaponized to suggest the attack was the byproduct of lax immigration enforcement, fueling panic about border security.Â Â

On X, ACT for America â an anti-Muslim organization founded by Islamophobic commentator Brigitte Gabriel â posted the suspectâs name while calling for âmass deportations NOW,â despite the suspect having been born in the U.S.Â

The reactions to the unfounded Eagle Pass claim highlight the consequences of misinformation that often follows breaking news events, and how unconfirmed information can sow panic and confusion.

FALSE NARRATIVE #2: The attack was a false flag orchestrated by Israel or Zionists to stoke Islamophobia and âjustifyâ war in the Middle EastÂ 

Conspiracy theories blaming Israel and Zionists for terror attacks are not new; events such as 9/11, as well as more recent incidents like the ISIS-linked Crocus City Hall attack in March 2024, have also been falsely attributed to Israel. Mirroring past conspiratorial claims, some accused the Israeli government of âcreatingâ ISIS, referring to the acronym as the âIsraeli Secret Intelligence Service.âÂ Â 
Â

FALSE NARRATIVE #3: Powerful, nefarious Jews are to blame for the attack

Antisemitic influencers seized on the New Orleans attack to promote overtly hateful falsehoods about Jews, suggesting that the incident was related to Jewish âinfluence.âÂ Â 
Â 
On X, antisemitic propagandist Brother Nathanael used the New Orleans attack and the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, which occurred on the same day, to claim that there was âsomething jewy [sic] here.âÂ Â

Â

Blaming Jews at large for acts of terror and violence is common among antisemitic influencers and extremists, who see any global event as an opportunity to promote their hate and bigotry.Â 
Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE #4: The government is either hiding the truth about the attack, or coordinated the attack itself

Purveyors of hate and disinformation weaponized the New Orleans attack to promote anti-government conspiracy theories and undermine the legitimacy of the government.Â Â 
Â 
Though the FBI has since indicated that they are investigating the attack as an act of terror, conspiracy theorists used law enforcementâs initial reticence to do so as evidence that the FBI was intentionally hiding evidence, such as the purported ISIS flag in the vehicle, from the public.Â Â  On Telegram, far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec claimed the FBI âlied about it to the world.âÂ

Some have pointed out that both Jabbar and Matthew Livelsberger â the suspect involved in the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas â were veterans, suggesting this common history is evidence that the attacks were an inside job by the U.S. military. A feature on far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jonesâ Infowars site alleged that the Biden administration was aware of the imminent attacks but allowed them to happen anyway.Â  Others accused the government of being more directly responsible for the attack, posting the phrase, âthe CIA created ISIS.âÂ

Dear Friends,

As I reflect on the end of the long year that has been 2024, two words come to mind first. âChallengesâ and âCommunity.â Or possibly just âgood riddance.â But before we turn the page, itâs important to reflect on the work that the ADL community did this year in the face of such upheaval. I am so grateful to our dedicated professional staff, our amazing volunteer leadership, our generous donors and everyone else who speaks up and shows up to fight hate for good in your neighborhood, online, on campus and everywhere that antisemitism and other forms of bigotry and extremism must not go unanswered.

We entered 2024 with the sobering realization that in the three months since the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, U.S. antisemitic incidents rose dramatically, foreshadowing a trend that would play out through the year. As I noted then, âthe American Jewish community is facing a threat level thatâs now unprecedented in modern history.â

In January:

Addressing what would be one of the themes for the year -- the hostile campus climate -- ADL launched our Not On My Campus Hub with tools and resources for students, faculty, parents and alumni.

In February:

ADL and The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education against Californiaâs Berkeley Unified School District for failing to take action to end nonstop bullying and harassment of Jewish students by peers and teachers since Oct. 7. This was part of a 2024 acceleration of ADLâs litigation efforts â our work is having an impact on campus and in K-12 schools, as well as in the workplace, online and in anti-extremism work.

In March:

ADLâs flagship event, Never Is Now, welcomed over four thousand attendees to learn, to connect, and to take action. This is a tremendous event with global experts in the fight against antisemitism and hate and a reminder that... letâs face it. No one can fight antisemitism alone. (We encourage you to join us March 3-4, 2025 for another extraordinary Never Is Now; click here to get our Early Bird rate before it expires in January.)
ADL launched our new ATLAS tool to provide a comprehensive picture of the state of antisemitism worldwide.
Authorities arrested Frankie Rizzello, a white supremacist, on felony charges thanks in part to ADL investigative work, which uncovered his identity and provided information to law enforcement.

In April:

The Countering Antisemitism Act was introduced. The bill, which would be the most far-reaching antisemitism initiative ever passed as national legislation, reflects substantial input from ADL; thousands of people across the ADL community also pushed hard to advocate for the bill. Sadly, it looks like this legislation will not be passed in 2024, but we will urge its approval again in 2025.
ADL released our annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents in the United States, and the numbers were appalling â the highest level recorded since ADL started tracking this data. This added up to an average of about one anti-Jewish incident every hour all year in 2023.
As one way to fight back against hate amid encampments and other protests that were widespread in the spring, ADL launched our first Campus Antisemitism Report CardÂ to help students, parents, alumni and others assess the schools they are interested in and to advocate for improvements. Schools have started to implement our recommendations, and we will keep updating the report card and pushing for schools to do better.

In May:

ADL launched our Campus Crisis Alert newsletter, which quickly became an invaluable resource for people concerned for Jewish students. (Donât get the Campus Crisis Alert in your inbox? Click here to subscribe.)

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/parentcaregiver-toolkit-responding-2024-nais-pocc,"The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) People of Color Conference, held from December 4-7, 2024 in Denver, was intended to be the flagship of NAISâs commitment to equity and justice in teaching and learning for independent schools. However, one group of teachers and students was notably excluded from the conferenceâs stated goals: the Jews. Several speakers, including the keynote speaker, used extreme, biased anti-Israel rhetoric, including falsely accusing Israel of âgenocide,â calling its creation âracist,â referring to those killed in Gaza as âmartyrs,â while downplaying the Hamas terrorist attack on 10/7. Jewish teachers and students in attendance reported feeling excluded and marginalized. Per one firsthand account, âWe felt so unsafe that we tucked our Magen Davids (Jewish stars) inside our shirts as others glared and whispered.â

ADL and several other leading groups in the Jewish community wrote to the head of NAIS expressing their outrage at what occurred during the conference. The NAIS President, Debra Wilson, thenÂ reached out to ""express my profound remorse over the divisive and hurtful rhetoric expressed on stage at last weekâs NAIS People of Color Conference in Denver. There is no place for antisemitism at NAIS events, in our member schools, or in society."" ADL appreciates both the expressions of remorse from Wilson and the outline of new steps being instituted to avoid future incidents involving speakers at NAIS events. While these steps are welcome, we remain hopeful that NAIS will take further action to educate its member schools on this type of rhetoric. Join our demand here.

If you are a parent or caregiver of a student who attends a NAIS-member independent school, you have the power to make your voice heard and affect positive change in your school community.

What can parents ask their schools to do?

Emphasize the Impact

If the school has not done so already, it should address the students and faculty who attended and were directly impacted by the antisemitic statements made at the conference which created a hostile environment for Jewish attendees.
Before reaching out to your school, consider reviewing ADLâs guidance, Championing Change: How Parents and Families Can Address Antisemitism in Schools. This guide walks parents and caregivers through ways to prepare for these conversations and gives examples of common incidents and what to do in response.
Make clear that this type of rhetoric was at odds with the purpose of the conference and the values of the school.
Explain why the rhetoric and slides used by the speakers was problematic, including the extreme, biased, and false anti-Zionist and anti-Israel rhetoric.
These guides can help those discussions:
Israel in the Curriculum
10 Ways to Have Conscientious Conversations on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
Questions, Complexities and Context: Insights into Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
In your conversation, itâs important to not discount the value and purpose of the PoCC and the otherwise enriching experiences that attendees had while also ensuring accountability and asking about the value of the conference for the school community.

Communication to the school community

If the school hasnât already done so, it should send a communication to the entire school community making clear that antisemitism is not acceptable and share the steps the school will be taking going forward.
Prompt, intentional and specific communication with the school community makes a big difference. Statements from school leadership sets the tone for the community.
Communication should be timely; describe the nature of the incident, use thoughtful, inclusive language, and choose terms that respect how affected communities self-identify; denounce the incident and reaffirm your schoolâs values.
For additional guidance, see ADLâs Responding to Bias Incidents in Middle and High Schools: Resources and Best Practices for School Administrators & Educators.

Review and adopt ADLâs Best Practices for Combating Antisemitism in K-12 Schools

Clearly define antisemitism and ensure consistent application.
Educate students, teachers and community members about antisemitism, and ensure robust Holocaust education in school.
Clearly communicate and enforce all policies and protocols, including codes of conduct and anti-bullying, anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies, and ensure robust reporting mechanisms are in place.
Ensure that schools do not teach problematic content that amplifies antisemitism and delegitimizes/demonizes the State of Israel and its existence.
Speak out and take action when antisemitism takes place.
Ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for Jewish students.
Additional resources are available at ADLâs Antisemitism in the Classroom Hub.

Elevate concerns to NAIS/pressure NAIS to take additional steps to address the issue

As an independent school and a member of the NAIS, your voice matters and you can join the chorus of voices urging NAIS to take the necessary steps to address antisemitism in schools. There are several sign-on letters circulating, or schools can send their own letter or otherwise make sure they are on the record making clear to NAIS that antisemitism has no place in our schools, our School Association or any programming.
Ensure that NAIS follows through on their commitment to better vet speakers and presentations for future conferences.
Commit to continued learning on understanding and combatting antisemitism.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-welcomes-resolution-its-complaint-against-school-district-philadelphia,"School District of Philadelphia Agrees to Address Repeated Incidents of Antisemitism

Â 

New York, NY, December 20, 2024 â¦ The School District of Philadelphia (SDP) has entered into a resolution agreement to take a series of steps to address repeated incidents of antisemitic harassment, bullying and discrimination in response to a federal civil rights complaint filed by ADL (the Anti-Defamation League).

Under theÂ terms of the settlement announced yesterday, SDP will undertake a series of initiatives toÂ ensure its compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when responding to allegations of harassment based on shared ancestry.Â These initiatives, among others, include developing or revising reporting procedures for incidents of harassment, providing annual training to all administrators, faculty, and staff on Title VIâs prohibitions, administering climate assessments to all students grades 6-12, and providing age-appropriate informational programs for all 6th through 12th grade students district-wide to address discrimination.

This resolution agreement resolves the allegations raised by ADL, represented pro bono by the law firm Mayer Brown LLP, in aÂ complaint filed in July 2024 with the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The complaint alleged that SDP knowingly allowed its schools to become âviciously hostileâ environments for Jewish students, while failing to address numerous incidents of antisemitic harassment, bullying, and discrimination.

âWe are grateful for the Jewish students and parents who had the courage to speak out against the pattern of antisemitic harassment, abuse and bullying they were experiencing,Â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO.Â âIt is clear from the resolution that OCR identified multiple ways the SDP wholly failed to meet its Title VI obligations, and itÂ is our hope that this resolution will ensure the District embraces a long-overdue commitment to preventing Jewish students from being harassed and targeted in the future.â

âWe are proud to have stood alongside the ADL and a courageous group of Jewish families in calling out the severe and persistent harassment and discrimination facing Jewish students in the District over the last 14 months, said David Yolkut, Counsel, Mayer Brown LLP.Â Â âWe are gratified by the OCRâs thorough investigation and detailed findings, and hopeful for a brighter day for Jewish students and their families.â

âWe welcome this decision as a vital acknowledgment of the challenges faced by students and their families and are hopeful that the district's commitment to implementing much-needed measures will create a more inclusive environment where Jewish students, and indeed all students, can feel safe and supported in Philadelphia schools, said Andrew Goretsky, EdD, Regional Director ADL Philadelphia. âWe look forward to seeing these commitments realized, ensuring that all students experience a sense of belonging and security in our educational institutions.â

According to the resolution agreement, The School District of Philadelphia has agreed to take the following actions to address and mitigate discrimination:

Issue and widely disseminate an anti-harassment statement.
Review its policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the Title VI prohibition on discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination based on a studentâs actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, revise its policies and procedures accordingly, and submit the revised policies and procedures for OCRâs approval.
Develop or revise its procedure for documenting each report or complaint of harassment.
Provide annual training to all administrators, faculty, and staff on Title VIâs prohibition of discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics.
Provide annual training to investigative staff to include a review of relevant district policies and procedures for complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics, including instructions on how to conduct and document reliable and impartial investigations, a description of the steps the district will take in response to harassing behavior, and a statement that a student or parent/guardian must be provided with notice of the steps the district is taking in response to the notification.
Provide an age-appropriate information program for all 6th through 12th grade students to address discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including harassment based on shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics.
Review its response to reports of discrimination and/or harassment on the basis of shared ancestry received during the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years to ensure that the district made a determination regarding whether the alleged conduct created a hostile environment within the districtâs education program or activities.
Conduct an audit of each school that serves any students in grades ranging from 6th through 12th grades to review the consistency of the application of and compliance with the districtâs policies and procedures regarding non-discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, including harassment on the basis of shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics for the 2024-2025 school year.
Administer a climate assessment to all students enrolled in the 6th through 12th grade after OCR reviews and approves the assessment, provide OCR with a report regarding its findings and steps taken in response to the findings, and promptly and fully address OCRâs feedback. And,
Retain or designate one or more consultants with expertise on the issue of harassment of students based on national origin, including shared ancestry, to assist in the development and delivery of training and the climate survey, and any other actions to prevent and address discrimination on the basis of shared ancestry.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin, including discrimination against Jews on the basis of their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding.Â  Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful.

Since Oct. 7, ADL has filed several similar civil rights and legal complaints against other public school districts for creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, including theÂ Berkeley Unified School District and theÂ Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD).

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/71-jewish-parents-and-37-non-jewish-parents-surveyed-say-their-child,"New York, NY, December 23, 2024 â¦ Seventy-one percent of Jewish parents and 37 percent of non-Jewish parents surveyed reported that their child witnessed or experienced antisemitism in K-12 classrooms or through course materials, according to a survey released today by the ADLÂ (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Antisemitism Research (CAR). This represents more than a third of all parents.Â 

These findings are part of a new ADL survey on attitudes of US adultsÂ and parentsÂ about K-12 education, which also found that more Jewish than non-Jewish parents reported their child experienced or witnessed antisemitic incidents in schools. These discrepancies highlight that Jewish students are more likely to report being targeted by and noticing antisemitism.

The findings also reveal a strong correlation between students' access to Holocaust and antisemitism education and their ability to recognize antisemitic incidents when they occur. In fact, parents whose children did not have access to antisemitism education were 46 percent less likely to report awareness of antisemitic bias on campus. This suggests that the reported rates of antisemitic or anti-Israel incidents are likely underestimated.Â 

âAntisemitism in K-12 schools is an urgent national concern,â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âThis escalation highlights the pivotal moment weâre in and the urgent need for Holocaust and antisemitism education. The time to act is now; future generations need to be equipped to prevent, recognize and address antisemitism.â

Although most of those surveyed were public-school parents, a significant proportion were parents of K-12 students in private and charter schools. Just lastÂ week,Â ADL expressed concern about antisemitic remarks at a recent conference of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) and that Jewish students and faculty attending the conference were subjected to a hostile environment.Â 

CAR research further reveals that 86 percent of parents surveyed support offering antisemitism education, whether optional or mandatory, in their local school districts, and 88 percent support K-12 Holocaust education. Moreover, 52 percent of parents believe Holocaust education should be mandatory.

Despite this broad public backing, there is a significant gap in educational offerings. Currently, only 21 percent of parents report that their childâs school provides antisemitism education, and 30 percent have access to Holocaust education, with 15 percent receiving both.Â 

These findings underscore the urgent need for school districts and policymakers to address the disconnect between public support and implementation. The ADL Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) is asking education leaders to take concrete steps to:

Integrate Antisemitism Awareness into Anti-Bias and Non-Discrimination Programs.
Mandate Holocaust and Genocide Education.
Eliminate Bias in Educational Materials.
Establish Strong Reporting Systems

Antisemitism is increasingly affecting younger populations as evidenced by the latestÂ ADL Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, which recorded 1,162 antisemitic incidents in non-Jewish schools in 2023, up from 495 incidents in 2022 - aÂ 135% increase. This surge reflects a broad trend across educational settings, public and private alike, as shown in this new study.Â 

CAR is furthering investigating these alarming initial findings with several planned future studies designed to hone in more precisely on these results.

Methodology

In October 2024, CAR conducted a nationally representative survey of 817 American adults through the Ipsos Observer panel to understand views on antisemitism and Holocaust education, perceptions of anti-Jewish and other forms of prejudice in local school districts, and, in the case of parents, their childâs experience with antisemitism at school and in course materials. Respondents completed the Qualtrics-based online survey over a weeklong period, with fielding opening on Oct. 8 and closing on Oct. 16. The sample was balancedÂ to match 2023 American Community Survey (ACS)Â benchmarks across race, ethnicity, age, and education level.

Of the 817 adults surveyed, 223 (27%) were parents of at least one current K-12 student. 96 (11.8%) of all respondents were Jewish. The margin of error for the survey was +/-4.2%.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/one-voice-many-countering-antisemitism-pennsylvania-community,"When signs of antisemitism began to emerge in her community, a mother reached out to ADL, having learned the power of community activism and ADLâs impact from her father.

On his first day of tennis practice, a freshman Jewish student at a high school in the suburbs of Philadelphia heard antisemitic âjokesâ from the court next to him. He told his teammate, also Jewish, to knock it off, and that his words were antisemitic.Â  Â 

Dorothy Potash, mom of the freshman and a resident of a town on the Main Line, learned of the incident when the tennis coach called to ask why her son left practice early. After hanging up, she approached her son, surprised he hadnât brought it up.

âMom, this is no big deal. This happens every day. Kids are always making antisemitic and racist jokes.â

Dorothy asked for other examples and her son told her about the day a student asked how he did on a paper assigned by a Jewish English teacher. When he replied that he received an A, his peer accused him of benefiting from a âJewish curve.â During a fire drill, her son heard a student say to him that this is for the Jews who should be burning. There were group texts among sports teams with antisemitic messages and the Jewish students in the group seemed too afraid to speak up.

A few months earlier, there had been swastikas spraypainted on local signs in a neighboring Pennsylvania town. Dorothy learned that middle school students were also part of group texts with antisemitic imagery and language. She assumed that the school administrators may not be aware of what was going on.

In the spring of 2023, Dorothy decided she wanted to do something about this increase of antisemitism in a way that could make an impact.

She turned to ADL.

She reached out to a friend on the ADL Philadelphia Regional Board and asked how she could get involved. He helped initiate the process for her to join the board.Â  In the interim, Dorothy reached out to several organizations that fight antisemitismÂ for resources on how to counter this hate. Everything she read spoke to the necessity of bringing multiple stakeholders from a community together in order to effectively fight antisemitism.

She relied on resources and data from ADL to guide her approach. She reviewed materials from AJC with sample language for municipal proclamations against antisemitism. Along with the support of a local Township Commissioner, she made a public statement at a commissionerâs meeting asking that her township pass a formal resolution against antisemitism and hate, as well as adopt the IHRA definition of Antisemitism. On July 17, 2023, her township issued a proclamation condemning antisemitism and all forms of hate. Both the regional directors of ADL and of AJC were present.

This was just the beginning.Â 

Carrying on multi-generational engagement with ADL

ADL and its work fighting antisemitism was not new to Dorothy. Nearly 30 years ago, her father, who was the solicitor for many school districts, faced a situation where a school board president made antisemitic and inflammatory remarks at a board meeting.Â  Her father called for an independent investigation into the incident. The then-chair of the ADL Philadelphia Regional Board made one of the first calls of support her father received. Dorothyâs father later joined the board and Dorothy, as a young adult, joined one of the meetings. She never forgot the impactful support of the ADL.

She has since followed in her fatherâs footsteps and officially joined the ADL Philadelphia Regional Board in the spring of 2023.

Addressing the high school climate

After Dorothy learned about the prevalence of antisemitism in the middle and high schools, she reported the incidents to the ADL Philadelphia Regional Office, reaching out for resources and support.

Dorothy felt she wouldnât be able to accomplish as much without âan organization with established credibility, trusted resources and people who know what they are doing.â

Dorothy sharedÂ with the high school administration ADL resources on countering antisemitism, such as information on Echoes and Reflections,Â a Holocaust education program led by ADL, theÂ USC Shoah Foundation and Yad Vashem, ADLâs Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, which provides statistics on antisemitic incidents across the country, including in K-12 schools, and ADLâs A Guide for Responding to School Sports-Related Bias Incidents.

After attending meetings with members of the ADL Philadelphia office, Dorothy said she âsoon realized the power of a quiet dialogue and the sharing of resources and facts, rather than raising voices and havoc on a soap box when it comes to dealing with complex issues and community leaders who represent many and multiple constituencies.â

The ADL Philadelphia office has seen increased engagement by the high school in activities to fight antisemitism. For example, they attended the ADL Philadelphia Annual Youth Leadership Conference on December 11, which brought together in an educational forum 400 Jewish and non-Jewish students and 75 educators in-person and an additional 700 participants virtually from nearly 40 schools.

Raising community awareness

This was only the start of critically needed broader community efforts.

Soon after making her public statement, Dorothy found allies among the township commissioners and the Superintendent of Police, who offered to help bring additional community stakeholders together for further engagement.

Dorothy met with ADL staff andÂ  school leadership, law enforcement, members of the interfaith community and other regional Jewish organizations. Together with a fellow ADL Philadelphia Regional Board member,Â  they co-founded the ADL Community Action Group Committee.Â The Main Line Community Action Group (MLCAG), along with three other ADL community action groups, exist to create a community of neighbors to support one another, share resources and join in advocacy, and report local hate incidents to ADL.

The inaugural meeting of the ADL Main Line Community Action Group, May 2024.

At a regional board meeting, an ADL speaker talked about the importance of making a difference in local neighborhoods or communities in order to further ADLâs mission: ""to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all."" This resonated with Dorothy.

âThe current state of antisemitism across the world and across our country is both astounding and overwhelming.Â  [Itâs] too much for one person or a small group of people to make an impact.Â  However, that one person or small group of people can certainly have an impact on their block, in their neighborhood, in their town, in their larger communityâ¦that is the power of the ADL Community Action Groups.â

Finding allies on-the-ground and online

Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Dorothy has noticed antisemitism manifesting in different ways, including the prevalence of misinformation and disinformation online. On December 11, she volunteered at the youth leadership conference, which addressed the spread of this false information.Â  Â 

âWe need to reengage with our allies, and we need to find new allies.â

Dorothy said there just doesnât seem to be any empathy or understanding and the best way to address this is through education which she says ADL has historically done incredibly well.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/unity-fields-what-you-need-know,"Unity of Fields (UoF), formerly Palestine Action U.S., is a radical far-left, anti-Zionist âdirect action networkâ that engages in and/or promotes aggressive, targeted protests and the defacement of property belonging to Jewish and non-Jewish organizations and individuals it considers supportive of Israel or Zionism or âcomplicitâ in Israelâs alleged actions.

It has also called for ""material action"" that reads as violence in these contexts. This includes a quote-tweet of a February 2025 X post with a clipping from a 1988 newspaper story about a bomb planted in a park in Northern Ireland where an Israeli bowling team was scheduled to play. The clip was accompanied by the UoF caption: ""Expand your horizons of what 'Palestine solidarity' looks like. Solidarity is material action.""

Â 

The groupâs stated mission is disrupting and âdismantling zionism [sic] and US imperialismâ through âmilitant direct actions.â Unity of Fields openly celebrates the October 7, 2023 massacre in southern Israel and other terror attacks against Israelis and is explicitly supportive of terror organizations such as theÂ Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Yemen-basedÂ Ansar Allah (the Houthis), andÂ Hezbollah, andÂ Hamas terror leaders likeÂ Yahya Sinwar.

It has claimed âdirect actionsâ of vandalism and disruption to U.S. sites belonging to a leading Israeli weapons maker and has endorsed and publicized such acts against Jewish targets like a synagogue and businesses owned by Jews.

Unity of Fields shares an image of Hamasâs Yahya Sinwar on its Telegram channel, October 2024. (Screenshot/Telegram)

Â 

The group regularly publishes âanti-imperialistâ propaganda, toolkits on âdirect actions,â and posts from others including one that called for âdeath to amerikkka,â âglory to the martyrsâ and to hold a âknife to the throat of zionism [sic],â submitted anonymously by email following firebombing attacks in California.

It also routinely shares content fromÂ Resistance News Network, a radical, antisemitic, anti-Zionist, English-language Telegram channel that promotes designated terror organizations, violence against Israel and anti-normalization with âZionists.â

Origins

Unity of Fields was formally launched in October 2023, shortly after the Hamas-led October 7 terror attack on southern Israel in which thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250, including children and elderly people.

The group was originally set up as Palestine Action U.S., the U.S. branch of anti-Zionist direct action network Palestine Action U.K. but changed its name to Unity of Fields in August 2024. In its announcement, the group said the new brand reflects its position as âa new front against the US Empireâ to âbuild the international popular cradle of resistance,â and called on supporters to send ""actions, reports, and analyses"" for distribution.

The name âUnity of Fieldsâ is a reference to the efforts of various Palestinian terrorist or Palestinian-aligned terrorist groups and organizations to coordinate activities and attacks since the May 2021 Israel-Hamas conflict. The group says the name comes from the Palestinian ""resistance"" â a euphemistic reference to the various terrorist groups responsible for violent attacks against Israel â and ""refers to the coordination between all the factions on the battlefield.""

The name change from Palestine Action U.S. to Unity of Fields occurred around the same time as the first wave of arrests by British authorities of Palestine Action U.K. activists following an attack in early August 2024 on a factory in the Bristol area belonging to Elbit Systems, a leading Israeli military technology company and defense contractor. U.K. authorities made subsequent arrests in the following months andÂ some of the U.K. group's leaders and members are facing charges like aggravated burglary, violent disorder and criminal damage with ""terrorist connection.â

In a 2023 interview after the group was established, James âFergieâ Chambers, who is involved with Unity of Fields, said the group was ""going to disrupt business and we're going to disrupt business constantly. We're going to use any means that we need to get that point across and to have the material effect that we want -- which is as H [Huda Ammori] said to shut the places down."" Ammori is a co-founder of Palestine Action U.K.

Â 

Chambers is a longtime American political activist, anÂ heir to the Cox family (of international conglomerate Cox Enterprises) and a self-proclaimed âprofessional revolutionary."" In the 2023 interview, he claimed Unity of Fields was an âaffinity networkâ that shares ideas and an âaffinity for direct action and an opposition to the occupation,â but does not necessarily dictate activities to other groups.

Unity of Fields is not a registered organization, and its funding sources are unclear.

Activities and rhetoric

Unity of Fieldsâ main activity is to encourage and promote direct actions such as defacement and vandalism of organizations, institutions, businesses, or homes of individuals it associates with Israel or Zionism.

Targets have included weapons manufacturerÂ Elbit Systems, companies like Starbucks and McDonald's, the office of an elected official, and establishments linked to Jews or Israelis.

The group invites submissions of âactions, writing, or propaganda in any media formatâ by members or followers of its network who film or otherwise document themselves engaging in vandalism, graffiti or destruction of property and distributes these to its followers on Telegram and/or X (Twitter), often with a caption applauding the action.Â

Â 

Since October 7, 2023, anti-Israel activists have claimed credit for at least 72 so-called sabotages of infrastructure or vandalism of private and public property across the United States to protest American support for Israel. Unity of Fields has dutifully reported many of these acts on Telegram, where it hasÂ nearly 10,000 subscribers, and on X, where it hasÂ a growing audience of over 6,000 followers. The group also regularly reposts such incidents from other accounts. Unity of Fields previously also posted to an Instagram channel with over 75,000 followers before its profile was banned in October 2024.

For a brief period in the fall of 2023, the group claimed credit for ""direct actionsâ in Massachusetts against Elbit sites. On October 12, 2023, activists with the group blockaded the entrance to Elbit Systemsâ Cambridge, Massachusetts location, barring employees from entering, and vandalized the building with red paint.Â The facility was vandalized twice more in the week that followed.

In November 2023, at Elbitâs Merrimack, New Hampshire facility, three activists were arrested on felony charges of rioting, conspiracy to commit criminal mischief, burglary, and conspiracy to falsify physical evidence. These were pled down to misdemeanor criminal mischief and criminal trespass. The sentence included 60 days in jail.Â The activists involved in the incident were dubbed the âMerrimack 3â and their bail was paid by Chambers.

Since it was founded, Unity of Fields has also distributed various toolkits and materials to instruct followers on how and why to undertake disruptive âdirect actions,â such as blockading entrances of companies, breaking and entering, spray-painting buildings with converted fire extinguishers (with instructions on how to convert fire extinguishers into spray paint devices) and causing harm to infrastructure.

Â 

Unity of Fields has also released several publications and statements that call for violence and escalation, including a May 2024 pamphlet titled âFlood the Gates: Escalateâ that coincides with theÂ strategic âescalationâ by anti-Israel activists on and off university campuses in the spring and summer of 2024. In the document, the group wrote that it was âinsincere to glorify the Palestinian resistance if, at the same time, we do not raise our own resistance here....We are not naÃ¯ve enough to think the revolution will come through ""peaceful"" means... without organized militancy.""

In a post ahead of the first anniversary of the October 7, 2023 attack, Unity of Fields referred to the terror massacre and the eruption of a âglobal anti-imperialist movementâ as a âgift to the world.â

The group said its objective is to âexpand the number of people embodying resistance ideas, and to inspire them to take actions that deepen their commitment to those ideas.

The goal is to make anti-imperialism, pro-resistance, anti-capitalist, and pro-liberation ideas an irresistible material force in the world.â

On the anniversary of October 7, it released a statement celebrating âthe Al-Aqsa Floodâ â Hamasâs official name for the October 7 massacre â and claimed that âIf victory over the US Empire and its zionist [sic] proxy is possible, it will be because struggles against them have erupted all over the world â Bring the war home!Â Two, three, many Al-Aqsa Floods!â

Â 

Earlier that month, on October 1, 2024, Unity of Fields celebrated a deadly terror attack in Tel Aviv that killed seven and injured several more, posting on Telegram. The group took a similarly gleeful tone when in September 2024, a gunman from Jordan killed three Israeli civilians at the Allenby Bridge border crossing, posting an image of a pistol and the outline of Israel and the Palestinian territories.

Â 

In a December 2024 tweet, Unity of Fields engaged in the denial of rapes and sexual assaults that took place during the October 7 attack, quote-tweeting Ali Khamenei, the Iranian regime's supreme leader and writing, âThe 10/7 rape atrocity propaganda, âSaddamâs rape roomsâ, âGaddafi supplies troops with endless viagra [sic] to encourage mass rapeâ, the lynching of Black men in the U.S. for their alleged âsexual predationâ of white women. This is part and parcel of the colonial playbook.â

Encouragement of Vandalism and Other âDirect Actionsâ against Jewish Targets

A small but significant segment of activity promoted by Unity of Fields includes the targeting of Jewish and Israeli or Zionist institutions, Jewish symbols, and Jewish Zionist individuals. By supportively sharing these incidents on its influential social media accounts, Unity of Fields helps to foster an environment where such activity becomes more normalized.

On September 5, 2024, it shared an âanonymous submissionâ where activists taped signs reading âIsraelâ¤ï¸rapeâ, âIsrael rapesâ, and âIsrael a rapist colonyâ on a âWe support Israel"" banner outside Congregation Beth El in Bethesda, Maryland.

That same month, in Brooklyn New York, vandals pulled down an LGBTQ flag with a Star of David. Unity of Fields posted a reel to its previously active Instagram page, with the text âtear down your local zionist [sic] flag.âÂ Â Â Â Â

Â 

In Houston, Texas, multiple businesses owned by Jewish restaurateur Ben Berg wereÂ vandalizedÂ in mid-May 2024 with red paint and antisemitic fliers. Unity of Fields celebrated the vandalism, highlighting Bergâs November 2023Â participation in a fundraiserÂ organized by the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston to benefit nonprofits supporting Israelis displaced by the October 7 attack and war with Hamas.Â Â 

The group also publicized the defaced facade of theÂ Historic Blue Moon Hotel, the family business of a former IDF soldier, Bram Settenbrino, in September 2024.

Â 

Later that month, Unity of Fields published photos from activists at the University of Minnesota, with graffiti reading ""Zionists off campusâ and âthe intifada is here.â

In May 2024, the group posted to its thousands of Telegram subscribers to âBesiege the Zionist embassies!â with an image that contained the phrase âlong live the resistance.â

Other Targets of Vandalism and Destruction of Property

Unity of Fields has also approvingly publicized destructive direct actions and targeted vandalism attacks on sites or offices belonging to shipping giant Maersk, construction and engineering manufacturer Caterpillar, Citibank, Bank of America and Starbucks, as well as city parking meters in Los Angeles, CA and subway fare readers in New York City.

In August 2024, it publicized the vandalism of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) office in Washington, D.C., writing a post that ended with theÂ inverted red triangle: âEscalation needs to increase 10 fold. The Zionist Entity needs to feel the heat from all sides... Honor all the Martyrs and Glory to the Resistance from HÃ¤mÃ£s [sic], Jeninâs Brigade, the Lions Den, HezBol, Yemen, and more. ð».â

In October 2024, the group posted photos of the vandalism to the New York office of Congressman Adriano Espaillat. In the post, Unity of Fields referred to Espaillat as someone who isâ bought and paid for by the Zionist lobbyâ though they claimed his ""action speaks louder than their blood money.""

That same month, activists also targeted the home of Gavin Kenneally, co-founder and CEO of Ghost Robotics in Philadelphia, painting ""Funded By Genocide"" across his garage, and ""I Make Killer Dogs"" on the sidewalk, throwing paint at the door and ring camera, and breaking windows. Ghost Robotics has supplied its technology to the Israeli military.

This is not the only incident involving Keanneally or Ghost Robotics. In July 2024, activists vandalized his townhome, and in November 2024, activists flooded it by turning on the water and letting it run. In October 2024, activists also vandalized âPennovation,â an innovation facility at the University of Pennsylvania that hosts a Ghost Robotics office.

Â 

Unity of Fields has also been supportive of student vandals, having taken submissions from those who defaced the University of California Presidentâs office in May 2024, vandalism at Georgetown ahead of its annual homecoming weekend in September 2024, and at Tuftâs Gantcher building.Â 

In July 2024, Unity of Fields reposted a message from a âSupport Committeeâ for Casey Robert Goonan, a California resident who wasÂ charged and indicted by a grand jury for a series of arson incidents at UC Berkeley, asking followers to donate commissary funds. Goonan was charged with the firebombing of aÂ UC Berkeley police car and a truck. At the time of these incidents, when Unity of Fields was still going by Palestine Action U.S, it posted on Telegram that these actions were done âin solidarity with the resistance axis for Palestinian life, liberation, and total decolonization of the zionist [sic] occupied lands.â

The post, submitted to the group, also read, âBlessed is the flame that burns down the settler-plantation. Blessed are the rockets that will free thousands of prisoners held captive by the zionist settler entity and US colonizer police stateâ¦Knife to the throat of zionism. Death to amerikkka. Glory to the martyrs.â

In May 2024, Unity of Fields republished a blog post from never sleep, an anarchist blog site. This post reads in part, âfour nights ago we set an NYPD bus on fire in Brooklyn as a peaceful protest against the cops for attacking anti-genocide demonstrators and their repression of protestors of Cop City.â

A month later, just before a presidential debate in June 2024, the group took to Instagram to post a 2020 photo of CNNâs Atlanta headquarters vandalized by protesters and fronted by a burning police car, alongside the hashtag #stopthedebate.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-commends-congress-prioritizing-investigation-antisemitism,"New York, NY, December 19, 2024Â â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the House Republican leadershipâs report concluding their investigation into the alarming surge of antisemitism since Hamasâs terrorist attack on October 7, 2023.

The committeeâs investigation found that several universities failed to stop antisemitism on their campuses, likely violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Additionally, the report found that several American-based tax-exempt organizations may have funneled American taxpayer dollars to designated terrorist organizations.

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO, issued the following statement:

We applaud Congress for continuing to exercise its oversight authority to investigate antisemitism on college campuses and whether American taxpayer funding is supporting terrorist organizations. We remain committed to continuing to work with Speaker Mike Johnson and Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to fight antisemitism in the 119th Congress.

The Staff ReportÂ on Antisemitism shines a light on many of the issues ADL has been sounding an alarm on for the past year.

The report calls on universities to recognize that discrimination against Zionists in an unacceptable antisemitic civil rights violation. College administrators have the responsibility to protect their students â yet they too often have failed to enforce their own policies and codes of conduct, frequently allowing offenders to face little to no accountability or disciplinary action.

The report also highlights that fiscal sponsors cannot be permitted to knowingly provide or facilitate the provision of material support to U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations. ADL has been tracking the Alliance for Global Justice and American Muslims for Palestine, the case studies in this report and testified on this topic before the Ways and Means Committee earlier this year.

We were pleased to see OFACâs designation of Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network as a sham charity and urge the incoming Administration to ensure taxpayer money is not used to fund U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations.

Congress must take swift action to protect the Jewish community on campus and beyond.Â  We will continue to advocate for passage of the Antisemitism Awareness Act and the Countering Antisemitism Act to give government the tools to more effectively combat the antisemitism crisis this report documents. In order to ensure the Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights can protect studentsâ rights on safety on campus, Congress must ensure that it hasÂ sufficient resources.Â As a crucial pillar in the global fight against terrorism, we urge the Senate to pass the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act with strengthened due process protections.

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-jewish-grad-organization-partner-fight-antisemitism,"New York, NY, December 18, 2024 â¦ JGO: The Jewish Graduate Organization, the leading organization on college and university campuses in America servicing Jewish graduate students, and ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced a new partnership to combat antisemitism and support Jewish graduate students on campus.

Through the partnership, ADL will provide JGO with resources, specialized training for staff and interns, educational opportunities, enhanced antisemitism reporting tools for graduate students, and co-facilitated webinars for students and alumni.

âStudents are facing horrific levels of antisemitic harassment on campus, so this partnership could not come at a more important moment for Jewish students and those moving into the workforce,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âWe are seeing a rise in antisemitism on grad school campuses around the country, and recognize the unique work that JGO is doing to support Jewish grad students during these challenging times. By equipping JGO students with the necessary tools and resources to counter antisemitism, we are empowering the next generation of Jewish leaders to stand up against hate.â

âAt JGO, we recognize the unique challenges and opportunities that Jewish graduate students face,â said Rabbi Dave Sorani, JGO CEO. âWe are proud to partner with the ADL to ensure that these students have the support they need to thrive in their academic journeys and beyond. This partnership underscores our unwavering commitment to fostering vibrant and resilient Jewish communities on grad school campuses, where future leaders are not only shaped academically but are also being empowered to embrace their Jewish identity proudly. Through this collaboration, we will work with the ADL to provide critical resources and programming to equip Jewish grad students with the tools they need to navigate and confront antisemitism effectively, stand up for themselves, and advocate for the broader Jewish community.â

This partnership comes as antisemitic incidents in the U.S. have reached historic levels, including a 500-percent increase on college campuses since Oct. 7, 2023. And it comes at a time when discrimination against Jewish job candidates is rising: A recentÂ ADL survey found that Jewish American job candidates need to send 24 percent more applications to receive the same number of positive first responses from prospective employers as Americans with Western European backgrounds when applying to the same role.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/hayat-tahrir-al-sham-extremist-record-and-regional-ambitions-syrias-new-rulers,"On November 27, 2024, Syrian rebel groups launched a major offensive against the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. Within days, forces led by Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), and supported by the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army and a range of anti-Assad militias, had taken Aleppo and Hama. On December 8, 2024, the rebel forces took Damascus, forcing Assad to flee the country. The HTS leadership quickly assumed control of government institutions, appointed an interim prime minister, and declared itself the de facto government of Syria.

HTS is designated by the US, UK, Canada and the United Nations as a terrorist organization. It emerged from the Al-Qaeda offshoot in Syria, the Nusra Front. HTS, in both its current form and as Jabhat Al-Nusra, has been accused of mass casualty attacks against civilian targets, including suicide bombings. They have also engaged in torture, as well as the repression, kidnapping and killing of religious and cultural minorities including Christians, Druze, Alawites and other Shia minorities, Kurds and other Sunni Muslims who do not subscribe to their extremist interpretation of Islam.

The leader of HTS, Abu Muhammad Al-Jolani â who has recently abandoned his nom de guerre and started using his real name Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa â claims to have been radicalized by the Second Intifada, before traveling to Iraq in 2003 to join international jihadist militias. From there, Al-Jolani joined ISIS and later Jabhat Al-Nusra. Al-Jolani is wanted by the U.S government â which is offering a $10 million reward â for orchestrating multiple terrorist attacks across Syria, and for kidnapping large numbers of Kurds and killing 20 residents of a Druze village.

Since before taking power in Syria, HTS has attempted to reform its image, mainly by claiming to have broken ties with Al-Qaeda. However, Al-Jolani has never actually disavowed his oath to Al-Qaeda, and even thanks it for âunderstanding the need to break ties.â In addition, and despite these claims, HTS maintains ties to a wide range of regional Al-Qaeda affiliates. HTS also claims to be tolerant of minorities as part of efforts aimed at domestic state building within Syria.

However, HTS' claims of tolerance, which appear to be crafted for Western audiences, are at odds with several key statements made by the HTS leadership in Arabic catering to the groupâs core constituencies, indicating that the HTS continues to subscribe to an extremist worldview and has wider regional aims which pose direct threats against Israel.

Examples of HTSâs Anti-Israel Views:

On October 9, 2023, HTS published a letter congratulating Hamas for the October 7 attacks.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.0, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/jewish-groups-urge-national-association-independent-schools-reject,"Speakers at People of Color Conference accused Israel of genocide and downplayed Hamas

Â 

New York, NY, December 11, 2024 â¦ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), American Jewish Committee (AJC), Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) and Prizmah: Center for Jewish Day Schools today expressed âdeep concernâ about remarks at a recent conference of the National Association of Independent Schools where several speakers used their time to accuse Israel of genocide and used extreme, biased anti-Israel rhetoric, including downplaying the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

In aÂ letter to the president of NAIS, the Jewish groups expressed concern that Jewish students and faculty attending the NAIS People of Color Conference were subjected to a hostile environment of extremely biased anti-Israel and antisemitic remarks time and again by multiple speakers, and had no choice but to watch as their peers applauded those tropes.

âIt is alarming that a conference supposedly committed to addressing issues of inclusivity and embracing diversity was turned into a vehicle to spread baseless, one-sided and hateful views against Israel and the Jewish people,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âWe believe the organization owes its Jewish students and faculty an apology. The NAIS needs to do a better job at selecting speakers and ensuring that Jewish voices are not being marginalized.â

âWe were horrified to hear what transpired at the NAIS People of Color Conference (PoCC),â said AJC CEO Ted Deutch. âWe must not tolerate any antisemitic rhetoric or exclusion and marginalization of Jewish identity in any education space. We are heartened by our conversations with NAIS leadership since learning what transpired and look forward to continuing to create and strengthen educational environments that refuse to normalize antisemitism in any form, are inclusive of Jews and Jewish identity, and are rooted in critical thinking, viewpoint diversity, and fact-based inquiry.â

âWe cannot allow civic and educational organizations such as NAIS, which promise to promote safety and inclusion for students and educators alike, to become platforms for antisemitism,""Â said Jewish Federations of North America President and CEO Eric D. Fingerhut. ""If educators whose job it is to ensure a hate-free learning environment are themselves being exposed to hate, we cannot hope to make things better for the Jewish students being confronted with antisemitismÂ everyÂ day.â

Prizmah CEO Paul Bernstein shared, âMany Jewish day schools and yeshivas in the Prizmah Network are actively involved in NAIS, and this has been a deeply hurtful and challenging time for our schools as we all struggle to understand how this could happen and why it has not been addressed.â

According to participants, various speakers, including the keynote speaker, Dr. Suzanne Barakat, presented biased one-sided views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, erased the millennia-old connection between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel, and flattened Jewish identity by excluding MENA Jews.

In the letter, the groups call on independent schools to âchampion nuanced and fact-based teaching of history and current affairsâ noting that âstudents should learn that international conflicts are complex and easy answers and accusations are rarely a panacea.â

As the situation in Syria continues to evolve, it is crucial that the international community works to ensure that Syria emerges as a stable and inclusive nation committed to peaceful coexistence with its neighbors.Â 

Â 

While the end of the Assad familyâs brutal dictatorship is a welcome development for the Syrian people and the region, we are very concerned about the role of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - a jihadist, US and UN designated terrorist group that traffics in overt antisemitism - will play in Syria moving forward. Despite HTSâs recent efforts to rebrand their organization as a moderate force, its ideology remains steeped in extremism and anti-Israel sentiment.Â 

Â 

The safety and security of Israel and others in the region remain an ongoing concern amid these uncertain developments. Israelâs efforts to secure its national borders and mitigate the risk of Syrian weaponsâparticularly chemical and biologicalâfalling into the hands of terrorist entities, should be roundly supported. The involvement of Turkey and Qatar, who have backed terrorist organizations like Hamas, as well as Islamist factions in Syria, raise serious concerns about how their dangerous ideology will impact Syria and the broader region.Â 

Â 

Finally, the international community must ensure the countryâs diverse ethnic and religious minority communities, including the secular Muslims, Druze, Christians, Kurds, Yazidis and others, are fully protected against violent attacks and other forms of persecution.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/news/opinion-heres-hard-proof-employers-are-discriminating-against-jews,"By Jonathan A. Greenblatt

Applying for a job is hard.

Whether youâre already employed or not, whether itâs your first job out of school or youâve been in the workforce for decades, it takes time, it takes energy, and it takes courage.

Candidates will pore over their resumÃ©s, practice for interviews, ask trusted friends and mentors how to put their best self forward.

Discrimination against Jewish job applicants:

But it turns out the name atop that resumÃ© sadly can still, in the 21st century, be a liability for Jews.

Thatâs the finding of a new landmark study from the Anti-Defamation League on discrimination in the job market against Jewish and Israeli Americans.

For this study, ADL asked a leading labor economist to conduct a field experiment submitting applications in response to administrative-assistant job postings using resumÃ©s that were identical except for specific characteristics, such as the applicantâs name.

The researcher sent out 3,000 applications this year for jobs in 23 cities.

Group applied for jobs using Jewish names, prior employers â what they found was troubling.

UCLA official put Jewish applicants on âno hire list,â complaint claims

By using names that suggested applicants were Jewish American, Israeli American or American with Western European backgrounds, the researcher was able to determine that individuals with Jewish- or Israeli-sounding names like âRebecca Cohenâ and âLia Avrahamâ would need to send many more applications than someone with a less ethnic sounding name such as âKristen Millerâ in order to receive a positive response.

How many more?

The survey showed that the fictional Rebecca would need to send 24% more applications, and fictional Lia 39% more, to receive the same number of positive first responses from a prospective employer.

Overall, the positive response rate was 3.4% lower for resumÃ©s with Jewish-American-sounding names and 4.9% lower for Israeli-Americans compared to those suggesting other backgrounds, such as Italian or Irish.

These are not just numbers.

This is groundbreaking evidence of serious antisemitic discrimination in the job market.

And letâs not fool ourselves.

The findings of this study arenât an aberration â they come amid a climate of unaddressed antisemitism in our country and of the vile antisemitic and anti-Zionist campaigns weâve witnessed since Oct. 7, 2023.

The hateful rhetoric weâve been confronted with for more than a year has real-world consequences, and we need to face it as a country and as a people.

We already knew that some Jewish people were changing their names on their doors, on delivery or navigation apps and elsewhere.

We knew that some people had started removing their kippahs or Stars of David in certain places to avoid harassment.

We also learned through our latest Online Hate and Harassment Survey that 41% of Jewish people changed their online behavior in the past year to avoid being recognized as Jewish.

None of this is acceptable.

Iâve been thinking a lot about all the Rebecca Cohens, Lia Avrahams and other Jewish people I know and how many of them may have wondered why, despite their qualifications and motivation, they were never called back for a position they dreamed of and thought they were qualified for.

On top of antisemitic incidents reaching record numbers and growing antisemitic beliefs, this study illustrates the very real need for employers, legislators and civil-rights officers to take anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli prejudice more seriously to ensure a workplace that works for everyone.

Federal labor law prohibits discrimination against a person in hiring decisions based upon their race, religion or national origin, and this should not be a high standard to uphold.

Iâve been thinking about those who did think about it because they had a hunch, or those who may have used a maiden name or another name for that reason.

But hereâs the thing: While you can wordsmith a work experience on a resumÃ© or an introduction email, you canât easily wordsmith your name.

During the Jewish immigration boom in the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants sometimes would choose American-sounding names at Ellis Island to make their path to full integration easier.

One would have hoped that in todayâs more tolerant world, hiding your religion or identity was a thing of the past.

This survey now gives us pause.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/american-jews-and-israeli-americans-experience-substantial-discrimination,"New York, NY, December 4, 2024 â¦ Jewish American job candidates needed to send 24 percent more applications to receive the same number of positive first responses from prospective employers as Americans with Western European backgrounds when applying to the same role, according to a study published today by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Antisemitism Research. Further, Israeli Americans needed to send 39 percent more applications, indicating substantial discrimination.

For this study, leading labor economist Bryan Tomlin, PhD, independentlyÂ conducted a field experiment applying online for administrative assistant job postings using resumÃ©s that were identical except for specific characteristics, including names, that signal if the applicants were Jewish American, Israeli American, or American with Western European backgrounds.

âThis is groundbreaking evidence of serious antisemitic discrimination in the labor market,â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âOn top of increasingÂ antisemitic incidents and growingÂ antisemitic beliefs, this landmark study illustrates the very real need for employers to take anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli prejudice more seriously to have a workplace that works for everyone.â

âWithout the benefit of a study of this kind, it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove adverse treatment in the labor market based on oneâs religion or cultural identity,â said Tomlin. âThis study shows that Jewish and Israeli Americans may be missing out on job opportunities just because of their identity, not their qualifications, and it provides a start toward quantifying some of these more subtle but still harmful symptoms of antisemitism.â

Tomlin conducted a pre-registered, large sample, field experiment, sending 3,000 inquiries to administrative assistance job postings across the United States between May 2024 and Oct. 2024 using identical email text and resumÃ©s that differed only in (a) the name of the applicant â selected to âsoundâ Jewish, Israeli, or Western European â and (b) resumÃ© signals of likely Jewish, Israeli, or Western European background. This methodology follows an approach similar to that utilized by other correspondence-based field experiments in the labor market.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/increase-islamist-extremist-terror-incidents-targeting-us-2024-adl,"New York, NY, December 2, 2024 â¦ Islamist extremist terror incidents targeting the United States increased in 2024 after several years of reduced activity, according to an evaluation released today by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center on Extremism. Federal and state authorities have arrested individuals in seven different incidents on charges related to five unsuccessful plots and two actual attacksÂ in the past year. At least three of these incidents targeted Jewish or Israeli individuals, institutions or businesses.

Perpetrators in two incidents were successful in causing serious harmâincluding a shooting injury against a Jewish man on his way to synagogue in Chicago, IL, on Oct. 26, 2024, and damaging of an energy facility.

""The rise in Islamist extremist terror incidents in the United States is deeply troubling and compounds an already complex extremist landscape,"" said Oren Segal, Vice President of the ADL Center on Extremism (COE). ""This year, which has been marked by support for and glorification of terrorist organizations at anti-Israel demonstrations across the country, the increase in terrorist plots and attacks serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by these groups and their ideologies.""

While Islamist terror incidents were commonâand sometimes quite deadlyâin the 2010s, due in large part to the rise of ISIS, they decreased considerably by the end of the decade. Between 2021 and 2023, the COE tracked only six Islamist-related terror incidents in the U.S., compared to 30 incidents with far-right perpetrators and five incidents with far-left or other perpetrators within that same timeframe.

In 2024, COE has tracked seven different terror incidents connected to Islamist extremism, compared to six incidents tied to far-right extremism and four incidents related to far-left or other extremism. The Islamist-related incidents stemmed from a variety of motivations, from a desire to support ISIS or its offshoots (such as ISIS-K in Pakistan and Afghanistan) to anger over the war in Gaza that began following the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks against Israel.

Incidents included both homegrown Islamist extremists inspired to commit a violent act in the United States and people who attempted to enter the U.S. to commit a terrorist attack.

The full evaluation is available on ADLâs website.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/islamist-terror-incidents-targeting-us-increase-2024,"January 2, 2025, Update: In the month since this article was originally published, at least two more Islamist-related terror incidents have occurred in the United States, including the deadly vehicular attack in New Orleans, Louisiana, on New Yearâs Day 2025, which killed 14 people and wounded dozens more.

The New Orleans incident was the deadliest Islamist terror attack in the United States since the 2016 shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people. Islamist extremists have attempted a number of vehicular attacks in recent years (inspired by a deadly attack in France in 2016 using this tactic). Most were prevented before they could be carried out or otherwise failed to cause mass deaths. However, in 2017, Sayfullo Saipov drove a rental truck down a bike path in New York City, killing eight people and injuring 12 more.

New Orleans, Louisiana, January 1, 2025.Â Shamsud-Din Jabbar of Houston, Texas, bypassed barriers to drive a rental truck into a crowd of New Yearâs celebrators on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, an attack that left 14 people dead and dozens more injured. The suspect had an ISIS flag on his vehicle and reportedly made videos prior to the attack in which he claimed to have joined ISIS. Jabbar was fatally shot by police after exiting the vehicle and opening fire, wounding two officers in the exchange. Shortly afterwards, police found explosive devices in the vicinity of the attack, possibly intended to target first responders.Â 
Fairfax, Virginia, December 17, 2024. FBI agents arrested an Egyptian citizen and George Mason University student, Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan, on a charge of demonstrating how to manufacture an explosive with intent to murder internationally protected persons. According to authorities, Hassan had praised Osama bin Laden and boasted about spreading Islamist propaganda online, including an ISIS-related video calling for the killing of Jews. Hassan also allegedly plotted his own mass-casualty attack targeting the Israeli consulate in New York City.

These recent incidents, as well as the other plots and attacks from 2024 detailed below, highlight that Islamist terrorismâwhether homegrown or coming from abroadâis still a threat to the United States. The dangers of Islamist extremism and terrorism cannot be ignored, even as the country also faces other significant terror threats, such as white supremacist mass shooters.

Â 

Islamist terror incidents targeting the United States increased in 2024 after several years of reduced activity, with federal and state authorities arresting individuals in seven different incidents on charges related to five unsuccessful plots and two actual attacks. Incidents included both homegrown Islamist extremists purportedly inspired to commit a violent act in the United States and people who attempted to enter the U.S. allegedly to commit a terrorist attack.

While Islamist terror incidents were common in the United Statesâand sometimes quite deadlyâin the 2010s, due in large part to the rise of the terrorist organization ISIS (the Islamic State or IS) and its efforts to recruit fighters to its ranks in Syria and Iraq and spread violence in other countries, they decreased considerably by the end of the decade. This was due to successful military action by the U.S. and other countries that greatly degraded ISIS. Between 2021 and 2023, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) tracked only six Islamist-related terror incidents in the U.S., compared to 30 incidents with far-right perpetrators and five incidents with far-left or other perpetrators within that same timeframe.

During these years, U.S. authorities still regularly made arrests linked to Islamist extremism, but most of these involved people providing material support, such as money, to terrorist groups abroad, or attempting to travel outside the U.S. to join such groups. Such arrests continue today; in November 2024, for example, Anas Said, a Houston man, wasÂ indicted for providing material support and resources to ISIS because of his alleged involvement in the creation of numerous ISIS propaganda videos and images.Â According to authorities, Said also unsuccessfully tried several times to travel abroad to join Islamist terror groups and even considered the possibility of conducting a violent act in the U.S., going so far at one point as to research local military recruiting facilities and Jewish targets, though he did not actually plot an attack.

Other people were also purportedly motivated by Islamist extremism to plot or commit violence in 2024. So far this year, COE has tracked seven different terror incidents seemingly connected to Islamist extremism, compared to only six incidents tied to far-right extremism and four incidents related to far-left or other extremism. These incidents seemingly stemmed from a variety of motivations, from a desire to support ISIS or its offshoots (such as ISIS-K in Pakistan and Afghanistan) to anger over the war in Gaza that began following the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks against Israel. Several of the terror incidents involved relatively unsophisticated perpetrators whose desire to conduct some sort of operation outpaced their resources or ability to carry one out.

However, perpetrators in two incidents were successful in causing serious harmâincluding a shooting injury and the damaging of an energy facility.

Incidents:

Chicago, Illinois, October 26, 2024. Authorities arrested a 22-year-old Chicago resident, Sidi Mohammed Abdullahi, on 14 felony countsÂ following a shooting attack against a Jewish man on his way to synagogue services. Abdullahi reportedly shot the victimâwho survived the attackâthen lingered at the scene for a half-hour to open fire on law enforcement and first responders coming to the scene of the shooting. Police returning fire seriously injured, but did not kill, Abdullahi. Following days of investigation, authorities subsequently added stateÂ hate crime and terrorism charges, saying that evidence from the attackerâs phone revealed that the shooting was planned and deliberately targeted Jews.
Peoria, Arizona, October 18, 2024. Police in ArizonaÂ arrested a teenager on state charges of terrorism and conspiracy to commit terrorism, alleging that he had been inspired by ISIS to plot an attack on a Phoenix Pride parade, using a remote-controlled drone with explosives. The juvenileâwho was charged as an adultâhad allegedly purchased the chemicals needed to make an explosive.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, October 7, 2024. Federal authoritiesÂ arrested an Afghan national, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, on charges of conspiring and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or federal crime of terrorism. Tawhedi had allegedlyÂ affiliated himself with ISIS-K, the branch of ISIS based in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and sought to commit a mass casualty attack in the U.S. on Election Day. Tawhedi and a juvenile accomplice were arrested while allegedly trying to purchase assault-style weapons and ammo for their attack from undercover FBI agents. French authoritiesÂ arrested two of Tawhediâs brothers on similar charges in that country.
New York, New York, September 6, 2024. As part of a two-country investigation, Canadian authoritiesÂ arrested a Pakistani citizen, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, who was trying to cross the border into the U.S., allegedly as part of aÂ planned mass shooting against a Jewish target in Brooklyn, in support of ISIS. According to authorities, Khan boasted that his attack would be the ""largest attack on U.S. soil since 9/11."" A federal indictment in the Southern District of New York charged Khan with one count of attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization.
Orlando, Florida, July 11, 2024. Federal authorities arrested Hashem Younis Hashem Hnaihen, a Jordanian living in Orlando, Florida,Â charging him with destruction of an energy facility and four counts of threatening to use explosives. According to prosecutors, Hnaihen targeted businesses he believed were supportive of Israel.Â Beginning in June 2024, he allegedly vandalized several Orlando-area businesses and facilities, including a propane gas distribution depot, leaving ""warning letters"" at the premises that included threats and demands. Hnaihen also allegedly attacked a solar power facility, causing more than $700,000 in damage.
New York, New York, August 6, 2024. In an international terrorist incident, federal authorities arrested a Pakistani citizen, Asif Merchant, in connection with an alleged plot toÂ conduct political assassinations in the U.S. Merchant allegedly traveled to New York in April 2024 to hire hitmen to carry out the killings but ended up paying a $5,000 advance to undercover law enforcement officers posing as potential assassins. Federal authorities say Merchant had ties to Iran. He was charged with one count of murder for hire, but in September 2024 federal prosecutorsÂ filed a new indictment that also charged him with attempting to carry out an act of terrorism.
Coeur dâAlene, Idaho, April 6, 2024.Â  Federal authoritiesÂ arrested Alexander Scott Mercurio on charges of providing material support to a terrorist organization. Mercurio allegedly plotted toÂ attack local churches on behalf of ISIS, in a bid to kill as many people as possible before being killed by law enforcement or dying by suicide. The 18-year-old Mercurio allegedly told law enforcement that he had previouslyÂ had white supremacist views but later switched to supporting ISIS.

The surge in Islamist extremist terror incidents in 2024 is troubling, especially as the terrorist threat from other forms of extremism, such as accelerationist white supremacists, has not decreased.

Moreover, potential future U.S. policies such as aÂ renewal of the so-called âMuslim banâ as well asÂ mass deportations could provide further ammunition for Islamist extremist propagandists abroad to incite violence within the United States. U.S. authorities must be sure to guard against the threat of terrorism from all potential sources, whatever the cause or ideology.","[2, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.1, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/accelerationism,"Key Points

Accelerationism is an ideology within some segments of the white supremacist movement that promotes violent actions and sabotage as a means to accelerate the perceived inevitable collapse of society, allowing followers to establish a white ethno-state in the aftermath.
The modern iteration of white supremacist accelerationism gained traction in extremist spaces in the 2010s following the revival of neo-Nazi James Masonâs Siege essays from the 1990s.
White supremacist accelerationism has inspired multiple terrorist plots and attacks in countries around the world, with most of them targeting Jews, Muslims, immigrants, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community.
Accelerationist adherents generate online propaganda that venerates past far-right killers and encourages people to emulate them, as well as manuals and other materials designed to provide guidance on targets and tactics.

Background

Accelerationism is an extremist belief rooted in some segments of the white supremacist movement that society is irredeemable, and that acts of violence and destabilization can âaccelerateâ a perceived inevitable societal collapse and usher in a white ethnonationalist state in the chaotic aftermath.

The ideology originated with the 1990s writings of an American neo-Nazi and saw a resurgence in the mid-2010s with the rise of theÂ alt-right extremist movement. Accelerationist adherents subscribe to a mix of racist, antisemitic, Islamophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs and conspiracy theories.

Accelerationist white supremacists may be hostile to other white supremacist groups and adherents who may not openly embrace violence as a tactic.

Since the late 2010s, white supremacist accelerationism has inspired dozens of terrorist plots and attacks across the world, with most targeting Jews, Muslims, immigrants, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community. Some have also targeted critical infrastructure to sow chaos.

Origins

The beliefs and attitudes behind modern white supremacist accelerationism largely originated with American neo-NaziÂ James Mason, a relatively minor figure in the white supremacist community in the 1970s, who was a member of George Lincoln RockwellâsÂ American Nazi Party and a later splinter group, theÂ National Socialist Liberation Front (NSLF). During his time as a member of the NSLF in the 1980s, Mason wrote and edited the groupâs monthly newsletter,Â Siege. The publicationâs contents included a wholesale embrace of violence against perceived enemies anchored in fascist ideology, the promotion of guerrilla warfare against âthe system,â praise for the murders committed by Charles Mansonâs followers as âdirect action,â and the glorification of Adolf Hitler.

In 1992, Mason compiled his writings from Siege into a single volume under the same name.Â For many years, these had little influence. However, the rise of the alt-right in the mid-2010s brought a wave of new, mostly younger recruits into the white supremacist movement, some of whom discovered Masonâs writings, and began spreading them, especially on the now-defunct fascist social networking forum Iron March.

These new Mason fans, many of them neo-Nazis, laid the foundation for what they dubbed âSiegeculture (Siegekultur),â a philosophy and subculture centered around Masonâs writings.

Â 

Iron March, which operated from 2011 to 2017, was instrumental in the formation of early white supremacist accelerationist networks. Members from this forum would go on to create the first neo-Nazi accelerationist group,Â Atomwaffen Division.

Subsequent groups followed and a series of deadly attacks by perpetrators who embraced accelerationist ideology shined a spotlight on this growing movement.

Ideology

White supremacist accelerationism is built on a series of tenets that set it apart from other white supremacist belief systems. Modern white supremacy takes various forms, though all variations hold one or more of the following beliefs:

1) White people should have dominance over people of other backgrounds, especially where they may co-exist

2) White people should live by themselves in a whites-only society

3) White people have their own ""culture"" that is superior to other cultures

4) White people are genetically superior to other people

Many white supremacists further believe that the white race is in danger of extinction at the hands of ânon-whitesâ (who, according to white supremacist beliefs, are being controlled and manipulated by Jews).

Accelerationist white supremacists hold these views, but also claim that modern society is inherently fragile, unstable, and heading towards an inevitable collapse. They advocate to âspeed upâ this collapse through violence, acts of sabotage and sowing general chaos, and believe that they will then have a real opportunity to reshape society to their own liking and beliefs. Accelerationist white supremacists may thus be more likely than other types of white supremacists to make explicit calls for direct, violent actions.

The targets of the attacks advocated for by white supremacist accelerationists vary, but can ultimately be split into two categories. The first consists of attacks against perceived enemies, including Jews (evidenced by theÂ 2019 Poway Synagogue shooting), people of color (seen in theÂ 2022 Tops Friendly Market shooting in Buffalo), immigrants (demonstrated in theÂ 2019 El Paso shooting) LGBTQ+ people (targeted in theÂ 2022 Bratislava shootingÂ and 2023 Colorado Springs shooting) and Muslims (shown by theÂ 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings).

The second consists of targets that could theoretically destabilize society when attacked, such as critical infrastructure connected to the power grid.

White supremacist accelerationist propaganda frequently encourages both types of attacks and provides detailed guides on the vulnerabilities of different types of infrastructure and how to exploit them. These materials also often insist that potential perpetrators are more likely to get away with such crimes than they think.

Although there have been some arrests for plots to attack the power gridâincluding the co-founder of Atomwaffen Division, who allegedly planned to attack an energy facility in Baltimore, MD in February 2023 â actual attacks by accelerationist white supremacists have overwhelmingly targeted humans.

White supremacist accelerationist propaganda also includes messaging that is openly hostile towards other white supremacist groups, labeling them as âmovementarians,â and criticizing them for their perceived lack of action and inability to effect change. There is also criticism from white supremacist accelerationists that other white supremacists are too concerned about theÂ âopticsâ of their movement, with accelerationists insisting that matters of public image and opinion are not as important as taking direct action.

White supremacist accelerationists also sometimes view joining large, organized groups as risky, insisting that followers opt for autonomous direct action instead.

Accelerationist groups

The first neo-Nazi accelerationist groupÂ Atomwaffen Division, founded in 2015 byÂ Brandon Russell and Devon Arthurs, sought to spread Masonâs ideas and promote the acceleration of societal collapse through violence, while simultaneously preparing its members for an impending race war.

Atomwaffenâs main actions included organizing âhate campâ hiking excursions and paramilitary-style activities to prepare members for societal destabilization and eventual collapse and indoctrinate new members. The group also organized propaganda distributions and attended rallies and events organized by other white supremacist groups.

Outside of these regular group activities, Atomwaffen quickly gained notoriety following the high-profile arrests of multiple group members. In May 2017 in Tampa, Florida, Arthurs murdered two of his and Russellâs roommates, Atomwaffen Division members Jeremy Himmelman and Andrew Oneschuk, while Russell was away for National Guard duty. Arthurs claimed to have committed the murders because his roommates ridiculed his recent conversion to Islam. He also alleged after his arrest that his roommates were planning terror attacks, possibly against nuclear plants. However, Arthurs suffered from significant mental health issues and was deemed incompetent to stand trial. After more than a year in a mental health facility, Arthurs was determined to be competent to stand trial, leading him to eventually plead guilty in 2023 to reduced charges of second-degree murder; he received a 45-year prison sentence.

During the initial murder investigation, authorities discovered multiple explosive components in Russellâs possession, which led to the Atomwaffen leader pleading guilty to possessing explosives and receiving a five-year sentence in 2018.

In January 2018, California-based Atomwaffen Division member Samuel Woodward connected with a former high school classmate, Blaze Bernstein, on an online dating app. Woodward arranged a meeting with Bernstein, stabbed him to death and buried his body in a local park. Woodward was convicted of murder motivated by hate toward Bernsteinâs gay and Jewish identity and sentenced to life in prison in November 2024.

These arrests, as well as the 2017 arrest of a Virginia teen and Mason admirer who purportedly committed a double murder (but killed himself in 2024 before trial), drew considerable attention to Atomwaffen Division from law enforcement.

The Florida incident also created a leadership vacuum in the absence of Atomwaffen Divisionâs two founders, Russell and Arthurs. John Cameron Denton assumed leadership of the group, but after police arrested him and four other members on harassment charges in February 2020, Atomwaffen officially disbanded. In July 2020, a small group of former members of Atomwaffen reorganized as theÂ National Socialist Order (NSO), and another splinter group would later form, called theÂ National Socialist Resistance Front, following ideological disputes between members.

In November 2024, the staff atÂ The American Futurist, an accelerationist publication affiliated with former Atomwaffen members, announced that the National Socialist Resistance Front had officially disbanded.

Before it fell apart, Atomwaffen had already served as the blueprint for many other neo-Nazi accelerationist groups inspired by its ideology and propaganda. Most of these groups were small, and many were short-lived, but they have spread white supremacist accelerationism into new corners.

In 2018,Â Sonnenkrieg Division emerged as a European counterpart to Atomwaffen, with its founder describing Sonnenkrieg Division as âAtomwaffen with less guns.â Like Atomwaffen, Sonnenkrieg advocated for the use of violence to destabilize âthe systemâ and bring about an eventual societal collapse. Sonnenkriegâs propaganda used many of the same Iron March-inspired aesthetic elements as propaganda produced by Atomwaffen. Despite Sonnenkriegâs relatively small membership, it was eventually listed as a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom in February 2020 and subsequently, activity from the group largely ceased.

Â 

Another Atomwaffen imitator wasÂ Feuerkrieg Division, an international white supremacist accelerationist group seemingly founded in 2018 by a 13-year-old boy from Estonia that ostensibly disbanded in 2020 but saw a resurgence on the encrypted social media appÂ Telegram the following year. Like Atomwaffen Division, Feuerkrieg Divisionâs beliefs were largely guided by Masonâs writings, and the group was allegedly linked to multiple terror plots and arrests, including the February 2020 arrest of Feuerkrieg memberÂ Conor Climo, who pleaded guilty to firearms charges following an investigation into an alleged plan to attack a synagogue and an LGBTQ+ bar in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Another ideological heir of Atomwaffen isÂ The Base, formed in 2018 byÂ Rinaldo Nazzaro, an American national from New Jersey currently living in Russia. Though small in numbers, The Base branded itself as a paramilitary or survivalist organization and Nazzaro claimed that its purpose was to unite white nationalists to prepare for violent insurgency.

Like Atomwaffen Division, The Base attracted notoriety and public scrutiny following separate infiltrations by a journalist, an activist and a law enforcement officer, and after the arrests of multiple members. In October 2021, three members of The Base in Maryland and Delaware were convicted on various firearm charges that the court determined were intended to promote federal terrorism crimes. A month later, three other members in Georgia were sentenced for their roles in an assassination plot against a couple they believed to be antifascists.

In the early 2020s, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union all designated The Base as a terrorist group. In February 2022, Nazzaro announced that he relinquished his leadership role in The Base, and the group saw little activity in the years that followed. However, in early 2024, individuals associated with The Base began distributing propaganda again in the United States, and by the end of the year, the group appeared to have a resurgence in activity, with social media profiles associated with the group sharing pictures of propaganda distributions and videos depicting training sessions with members.

Also noteworthy in the white supremacist accelerationist landscape isÂ Injekt Division, a small accelerationist group active in spreading propaganda online and through the distribution of stickers and fliers. Injekt Division gained media attention after alleged founder Coleman BlevinsÂ was arrested in May 2021 for reportedly making threats to conduct a mass shooting at a Walmart in Kerrville, Texas. In May 2024, a jury convicted him on related firearms charges, leading to a five-year sentence.

Activity from the group dwindled following Blevinsâ arrest, but the group reemerged online in April 2023. In 2024, offline activity from the group was largely confined to Pennsylvania.

The Tarrant Effect and a Rise in Notoriety

A seminal event for the accelerationist movement was the 2019 deadly mass shooting in New Zealand by a lone-wolf killer. The live-streamed attack provided a boost in visibility and popularity for accelerationism and came to serve as a blueprint for similarly motivated killings.

In March 2019, Australian white supremacistÂ Brenton Tarrant launched shooting attacks inside two separate mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, where congregants were gathered, killing 51 people and injuring 89.

Tarrant likely deliberately structured his attacks to inspire other violent accelerationists to follow in his footsteps. Before the mass killings, Tarrant released an online manifesto titled âThe Great Replacement,â a direct reference to the white supremacistÂ âGreat Replacementâ conspiracy theory. Though not the first person to release a manifesto before a largescale act of violence, Tarrantâs document stood out because it not only contained hateful justifications for the attack, but also a series of memes, in-jokes and âshitpostsâ born out of far-right online spaces like 4chan and 8chan.

Many other white supremacist shooters later emulated this style of manifesto, includingÂ Ryan Palmeter, who killed three people at a Dollar General store in Jacksonville, Florida, on August 26, 2023, before taking his own life. Palmeter stated in his own manifesto that Tarrant served as the primary inspiration for his attack.

Seemingly trying to simulate first-person shooter video games, Tarrant also attached a camera to his helmet and live-streamed his attack on Facebook, giving viewers a first-person perspective of the massacre.Â Payton Gendron, who carried out a deadly shooting at the Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo, NY in May 2022, later emulated this tactic, as didÂ Arda KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kyetim, who, according to authorities, carried out a mass stabbing attack at a mosque in EskiÅehir, Turkey in August 2024.

Anderson Lee Aldrich, who opened fire at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in November 2022, killing five, tried but failed to livestream his attack;Â Stephan Balliet, who tried to attack a synagogue in Halle, Germany, in October 2019, livestreamed his attempts to get into the establishment to launch his attack. He failed to get inside but later shot and killed two people nearby.

Terrorgram

Since its emergence, many online communities have promoted white supremacist accelerationism, but few were more influential than theÂ Terrorgram Collective, a decentralized collection of white supremacist accelerationist groups and individuals active on Telegram.

Terrorgram first took shape in 2019-2020, in the wake of the attacks by Tarrant and others. These attacks inspired accelerationists to create propaganda specifically to encourage more white supremacist accelerationist terror attacks. These propagandists became known as the Terrorgram Collective, an inner circle within the Terrorgram network that focuses on the creation and circulation of Terrorgram-branded materials. These materials, typically circulated in the form of digital publications and short-form propaganda videos, seek to inspire violence against Jews, people of color, Muslims, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community and other groups or individuals perceived as enemies.

The materials created and promoted by Terrorgram differ from typical white supremacist propaganda in two main ways. While most white supremacist propaganda seeks to generally demonize perceived enemies, with few explicit calls to violence (often out of fear of law enforcement action or lawsuits), the Terrorgram Collective directly calls for its audience to take violent action, even providing implicit or explicit instruction on how to commit various acts of violence.

A portion of the cover of The Hard Reset, the most recent publication released by the Terrorgram Collective.

Â 

Additionally, Terrorgram propaganda calls for not just violence against people, but destruction and sabotage of other physical targets, including transportation infrastructure such as railroads and bridges, communication infrastructure such as 5G towers, and electrical infrastructure such as transformers and distribution substations.

In September 2024, federal authorities arrested two leaders of the Terrorgram Collective, Matthew Allison of Boise, Idaho and Dallas Humber of Elk Grove, California, as part of a 15-count indictment for soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. In the charging documents, federal authorities alleged that the two directly inspired at least three terror attacks both in the U.S. and abroad.

In January 2025, the United States governmentÂ designated the Terrorgram Collective and three of its foreign-based leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists.

Key Incidents and Arrests

Since 2019, white supremacist accelerationists have been implicated in several attacks, attempted attacks, plots and other incidents leading to arrests. Nearly every instance below has resulted in the arrest of the perpetrator, and in some cases, arrests were made before the plot could be fully carried out.

The targets of these attacks have been both in and outside of the United States.

Nashville, Tennessee, November 4, 2024:Â Federal authorities arrestedÂ Skyler Philippi after he unknowingly collaborated with two undercover agents while allegedly plotting to carry out an attack on an electrical substation near Nashville. According to the criminal complaint, Philippi planned on carrying out the attack in furtherance of his white supremacist accelerationist ideology. At the time of publication, Philippi is awaiting trial.
EskiÅehir, Turkiye, August 12, 2024:Â Turkish authorities arrestedÂ Arda KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kyetim after he allegedly carried out a stabbing attack at a mosque, injuring five people. Shortly before the attack, the perpetrator released a manifesto that appeared to be influenced by white supremacist accelerationism, and a folder containing PDFs of white supremacist accelerationist texts, including the Terrorgram Publications. At the time of publication, no further information is available regarding the status of his case.
East Brunswick, New Jersey, July 11, 2024: Federal authorities arrestedÂ Andrew Takhistov after he allegedly solicited an undercover agent to commit an attack against an electrical substation in New Jersey. The teen allegedly instructed the undercover agent on how to carry out the attack and sent them Terrorgram materials intended to help them in carrying out the operation. At the time of publication, Takhistov is awaiting trial.
Jacksonville, Florida, August 26, 2023:Â According to the authorities,Â Ryan Christopher Palmeter carried out a mass shooting in a Dollar General store, killing three individuals, all of whom were Black. Before carrying out the attack, Palmeter wrote a manifesto that appeared to be inspired by accelerationist themes and contained many similarities to the manifesto released by Brenton Tarrant before his attack. Palmeter took his own life shortly after the attack.
Baltimore, Maryland, February 3, 2023:Â Federal authorities arrested former Atomwaffen Division leaderÂ Brandon Russell and Sarah Beth Clendaniel for allegedly plotting to destroy an energy facility outside of Baltimore, Maryland. Clendaniel pleaded guilty in May 2024 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison in September 2024, while Russellâs trial began in early 2025.
Manchester, United Kingdom, January 27, 2023:Â British authorities sentencedÂ Daniel Harris to 11.5 years in prison for the creation and dissemination of videos that purportedly inspired Payton Gendron and Anderson Lee Aldrich, who carried out deadly 2022 attacks in Buffalo, New York and Colorado Springs, Colorado, respectively.
Colorado Springs, Colorado, November 19, 2022:Â Anderson Lee Aldrich opened fire inside of LGBTQ+ bar Club Q, killing five and injuring 19.

Aldrich was found guilty and sentenced to 190 years in prison.
Bratislava, Slovakia, October 12, 2022:Â Juraj Krajcik opened fire outside of a gay bar and killed two people, one man and one non-binary person. In a manifesto released before the attack, he thanked the Terrorgram Collective and recommended two of their publications to readers of his manifesto. Krajcik took his own life within hours of the attack.
Buffalo, New York, May 14, 2022:Â Payton Gendron entered a Tops supermarket and opened fire, shooting 13 people, ten fatally. In his manifesto, he claimed to be inspired by Brenton Tarrant, with entire sections of his manifestoÂ directly plagiarized from Tarrantâs. Gendron pleaded guilty to state terrorism and murder charges in November 2022 and was sentencedÂ to life in prison without parole in February 2023.
Raleigh, NC, August 21, 2021: Federal authorities chargedÂ Paul James Kryscuk, Liam Collins, Jordan Duncan and Joseph Maurion, and later Justin Wade Hemanson, with conspiracy to damage an energy facility.

Watkins was sentenced to up to six years in 2022, Gorman was sentenced to four years of parole in 2022, Denton was sentenced to 48 months in 2022, and Webb was sentenced to five years of probation in 2022.
Louisville, Kentucky, June 10, 2020:Â Federal authorities arrested U.S. Army memberÂ Ethan Melzer for plotting an attack on the soldiers in his unit. Charging documents alleged that Melzer provided sensitive information regarding his unitâs anticipated deployment to âRapeWaffen Division,â which claims to be a splinter group of Atomwaffen Division. Melzer pled guilty in June 2022 and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison.
Greenbelt, Maryland, January 16, 2020:Â Federal authorities arrested three members of The Base, Brian Mark Lemley Jr., William Garfield Bilbrough IV and Canadian national Patrik Jordan Mathews with charges relating to transporting firearms and harboring aliens. According to law enforcement, the three men were planning on attending an upcoming pro-gun rally in Virginia the following week. All three men pleaded guilty to related charges and received prison sentences,Â Lemley and Mathews received nine-year sentences whileÂ Bilbrough received five.
Halle, Germany, October 9, 2019: Stephan Balliet livestreamed himself attempting to enter a synagogue armed with improvised firearms and explosives.

Manshaus was sentenced to 21 years in prison in 2020.
Las Vegas, Nevada, August 9, 2019:Â Federal authorities arrestedÂ Conor Climo, who discussed plans to set fire to a Las Vegas synagogue, and he laterÂ pleaded guilty to one count of possession of an unregistered firearm and wasÂ sentenced to two years in prison. According to court documents, Climo had ties to Feuerkrieg Division.
El Paso, Texas, August 3, 2019:Â Patrick Crusius killed 23 people at a Walmart in a predominantly Hispanic area. In his manifesto, he cited Brenton Tarrantâs attack in Christchurch as a source of inspiration. In 2023, Crusius was sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in prison.
London, United Kingdom, June 18, 2019:Â Authorities sentenced Michael Szewczuk and Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, both members of Sonnenkrieg Division, for encouraging terrorist attacks. Dunn-Koczorowski was sentenced to 18 months, while Szewczuk was sentenced to just over four years.
Poway, California, April 27, 2019: John Earnest opened fire at the Chabad of Poway, killing one and injuring three others, shortly after a separate arson incident against a local mosque in late March 2019. In his own manifesto, Earnest referenced Tarrant and his attack multiple times and referred to Tarrant as the âcatalystâ for his actions. In 2021, EarnestÂ pleaded guilty to a 113-count federal hate crimeÂ indictment and wasÂ sentenced to life plus 30 years.
Christchurch, New Zealand, March 15, 2019: Brenton Tarrant drove to two separate mosques, and livestreamed himself carrying out a mass shooting that resulted in 51 deaths. In a manifesto released shortly before the attack, Brenton Tarrant had a section titled âDestabilization and Accelerationism: Tactics for Victoryâ in which he writes that white supremacists âmust destabilize and discomfort society where ever [sic] possible.â Tarrant pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving life in prison without parole.","[2, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.1, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-brandeis-center-settle-title-vi-complaint-after-occidental-college,"New York, NY, November 26, 2024 â¦ Occidental College has agreed to take a series of steps to address and prevent antisemitism on campus as part of a sweeping settlement agreement reached in response to a federal Title VI complaint filed by ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law.

Under the terms of the settlement announced today, the Los Angeles-based private liberal arts college has agreed to undertake a series of initiatives to repair the campus climate, including adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Allianceâs (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism when reviewing complaints of antisemitic harassment and discrimination, and holding campus-wide Title VI trainings for both faculty and students, which will include specific sessions on antisemitic harassment.

The agreement resolves the allegations raised by the ADL and the Brandeis CenterÂ in aÂ complaint filed by the organizations in April 2024 with the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The complaint charged that Jewish students enrolled at Occidental encountered a âpervasive and hostile environmentâ that included severe antisemitic bullying, intimidation and physical threats in the weeks and months following the Hamas massacre in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

âThis agreement demonstrates Occidental Collegeâs commitment to counter all forms of contemporary antisemitism and underscores their recognition that effectively combatting antisemitism requires understanding the relationship between Jewish identity, Israel, and Zionism,â said Alyza D. Lewin, President of the Brandeis Center. âWe are gratified by the schoolâs engagement in meaningful discussions at the highest levels of the administration, and we are heartened that Occidental has committed to creating a safer environment for Jewish students. When implemented, this agreement will help ensure that Jewish students are able to learn and thrive in an environment free from anti-Semitic hate, discrimination, and harassment.â

âWe are pleased that Occidental College has committed to meaningful steps to ensure that the civil rights of Jewish students on campus are protected and affirm that antisemitism has no place on campus,â added Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âThis outcome demonstrates how the Title VI OCR process can work to effectively protect Jewish students. We are deeply grateful for the U.S. Department of Educationâs dedication and assistance in resolving this case. It is our hope that this resolution will lead to other college administrators implementing these or similar measures proactively to address antisemitism on campus.â

The parties negotiated the agreement with the support of an OCR mediator.

According to the resolution agreement signed by all parties, Occidental agreed to take the following actions to mitigate antisemitism on campus going into the 2025-26 academic year:

Update the Collegeâs Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Policy (âDHR Policyâ), including examples of prohibited conduct that could constitute disparate treatment or harassment based on shared ancestry, such as Jewish identity.
Consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition and examples of antisemitism (âIHRA definitionâ) when reviewing complaints of potential antisemitic harassment or discrimination.
Incorporate the IHRA definition into educational materials that will be made available on Occidentalâs website.
Require training for all students on Title VI and the collegeâs discrimination, harassment and retaliation policy, including the collegeâs complaint process.
Update the collegeâs time, place and manner policies to place reasonable limitations on the hours and conduct of demonstrations on campus.
Assess the campus environment using two planned climate surveys during the 2024-25 academic year to assess whether individuals have experienced antisemitic harassment or discrimination. The survey results will be shared with the Occidental community and made public on the collegeâs website.
Provide expert-facilitated training for the collegeâs Civil Rights & Title IX Office staff and members of the Bias Education and Support Team regarding (i) Jewish identity (including common issues of faith, history, and heritage) and (ii) forms of antisemitism, including how it can be used to discriminate against Jewish and Israeli students.
Include the following examples in the above listed training: âposting a threatening statement about Zionists on a Jewish or Israeli studentâs doorâ and âapplying a âno Zionistâ litmus test for participation in any Occidental activity.â
Appoint an Associate Director of Jewish Student Life.
Form a Presidential Advisory Group, which will produce a report to the President during the 2024-2025 academic year, including recommendations for specific, high-impact programs to build a foundation for inter-group dialogue.Â 
Continue to offer lectures and workshops related to the historical antecedents and modern manifestations of antisemitism and the connections between Jewish identity, Israel and Zionism.

The original complaint detailed how Jewish students were forced out of school-sponsored employment opportunities due to severe and pervasive antisemitic environments. Jewish students were harassed and obstructed daily on campus, in their dorms, in the dining hall, and elsewhere.

Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination against Jews on the basis of their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding. Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful.Â Â 

The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law is an independent, unaffiliated, nonprofit corporation established to advance the civil and human rights of the Jewish people and promote justice for all. LDB engages in research, education, and legal advocacy to combat the resurgence of antisemitism on college and university campuses, in the workplace, and elsewhere. It empowers students by training them to understand their legal rights and educates administrators and employers on best practices to combat racism and antisemitism. More atÂ www.brandeiscenter.com

Anti-bias education is a comprehensive approach to teaching and learning designed to increase the understanding of identity and differences and their value to an inclusive and just society and to actively challenge bias, discrimination in schools, communities and society. Anti-bias education incorporates inclusive curriculum content that reflects diverse experiences and perspectives, instructional methods that advance all studentsâ learning, and strategies to establish and sustain safe, inclusive, respectful and equitable learning communities.

ADL Education's Approach to Anti-Bias Education

ADL Educationâs anti-bias education pillars reflect our philosophy for how students (and others) recognize and build understanding of bias in themselves, others, and society and learn ways to address and challenge it. These pillars are foundational to our approach and are adapted and modified based on age and grade level. We believe that these pillars are best learned through interactive activities and respectful group dialogue that facilitates sharing of knowledge, perspectives and experiences.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",MEDIUM

New York, NY, November 25, 2024 ... The Anti-Defamation Leagueâs (ADL) Task Force on Middle East Minorities condemns the tragic murder of Chabad emissary Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the United Arab Emirates. This horrific act underscores the urgent need to confront rising extremism, antisemitism, and hatredÂ in the Middle East.

We appreciate the quick action by UAE authorities to apprehend three suspects connected to Rabbi Kogan's murder and call on the Emirati government to ensure all of those involved in planning and carrying out the killing are brought to justice.

Rabbi Koganâs murder highlights the vital need for the UAE to continue prioritizing the fight against extremism, and to do so in collaboration with regional partners and global allies.

As members of the ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities, we urge the UAE to continue its important work in fostering regional peace and acceptance, and to take additional measures aimed at ensuring Jews and others are protected against violence and other threats.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/millions-examples-extremist-and-antisemitic-content-found-steam-new,"New York, NY, November 14, 2024, â¦Â  More than 1.8 million unique pieces of extremist or hateful content, including explicitly antisemitic, neo-Nazi and Islamist terrorist material, were identified on Steam, the worldâsÂ largest and most popular online gaming marketplace, new research from ADL (Anti-Defamation League) finds.

In an unprecedented platform-wide capture of all publicly available profiles, groups and comments (as of July 2024), the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) also identified 1.5 million unique users and over 73,000 groups who used at least one piece of potentially extremist or hateful content. The comprehensive dataset includes more than 458 million profiles, 152 million profile and group avatar images and 610 million comments on user profiles and groups.

Millions of these hateful or extremist examples were found on Steam Community, Steamâs social networking space where users can connect and share content. Hateful and extremist content includedÂ tens of thousands of pieces of terrorism-related content;Â more than 15,000 accounts had profile pictures containing the logos and flags of foreign terrorist organizations like ISIS, Hezbollah, Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas, as well as the names of known terrorists. COE also identifiedÂ antisemitic symbols like the âhappy merchantâ and Nazi imagery like theÂ Totenkopf,Â swastika,Â sonnenrad and others. Posts with these symbols remained on the platform despite previous concerns raised byÂ governmentÂ bodies andÂ policymakers.Â Â 

âThe wide breadth and sheer volumeÂ of hateful and antisemitic content on Steam is mind-boggling,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âADL researchers found millions of examples on the worldâs largest online gaming distribution service glorifying everything from Nazi symbols to Islamist terrorists. This means millions of young and vulnerable people are regularly exposed to dangerous individuals and rhetoric, with a very real risk of inflicting harm both online and offline. Steamâs parent company, Valve, needs to make significant changes in terms of policy and practice to address this shocking proliferation of hate.â


Additional findings include:

Copypastas (blocks of text that are copied and pasted to form images or long-form writing) are a popular method for sharing extremist or hateful content on Steam.Â COE detected 1.18 million unique instances of extremist and hateful copypastas, 54 percent (634,749) of which were white supremacist and 5 percent (55,109) were antisemitic. The most popular copypastas were, by far, variations of swastikas, at 51 percent.
A significant number of Steam users and group pages use an avatar (profile picture) with potentially extremist or hateful symbols. Multiple users can have the same avatar image. COE identified 827,758 profiles with avatars that contained extremist or hateful symbols.
COE also identified 184,622 instances of hateful or extremist keywords on Steam. Additionally, 18,352 groups used extremist or hateful keywords on their group profiles. The most used keywords in an extremist or hateful context on Steam Community are â1488,â âshekelâ and âwhite power.â
COE analysts identified thousands of profiles that glorify violent extremists, like white supremacist mass shooters. These include avatar pictures featuring mass shooters, references to manifestos and stills from livestreamed attacks, like theÂ 2019 Christchurch, New Zealand shooting. In some cases â like the 18-year-old whoÂ attacked a cafÃ© in Turkey in Aug. 2024 â users posting this content on Steam have subsequently committed acts of offline violence.

âWe believe this is the most comprehensive snapshot of hate and extremism present on Steam to date,â said Oren Segal, VP of the ADL Center on Extremism. âThe clear gaps in Steamâs moderation policies not only normalize hate and extremism in the gaming community, but also introduce users to the ideologies and movements that animate real world violence.""

Earlier this year, the annualÂ ADL Hate and Harassment in Online Gaming survey found that harassment of young gamers increased across the board, with three-quarters of teens and pre-teens saying they experienced harassment while playing online multiplayer games, up from 67 percent in 2022. Identity-based harassment of young people ages 10-17 increased to 37 percent in 2023, up from 29 percent in 2022. Nine percent of teens were exposed to white supremacist ideologies in online games, and of those, 30 percent were exposed on a weekly or greater basis.

The report includes detailed recommendations for Valve and for policy makers:

For Valve:

Adopt Policies Prohibiting Extremism. Currently there is no policy on Steam that prohibits the presence of known extremists, extremist recruitment, the celebration of extremist groups and movements or even the expression of the hateful ideologies that animate extremists. While the game industry is, in general, behind the social media industry in addressing the abuse of their products by extremist actors, we have seen some progress in the last year. ADL reviewed the recent progress and wrote about three current models for game companies to potentially implement anti-extremism policies.
Adopt Policies Prohibiting Hate.
Enforce Policies Accurately at Scale.
Audit and Red Team Content Moderation Practices to Close Loopholes.
Engage with Civil Society, Academics and Researchers.Â 
Â 

For Policy Makers:

As ADL has saidÂ previously, policymakers must demonstrate their commitment to disrupting hate and harassment in online multiplayer games. ADL recommends stakeholder groups take the following steps to play an active role in promoting online safety and mitigating the risk of these dangers and their impact on users:

Prioritize transparency legislation in digital spaces and include online multiplayer games.
Enhance access to justice for victims of online abuseÂ as existing laws have not kept up with increasing and worsening forms of digital abuse. Policymakers must introduce and pass legislation that holds perpetrators of severe online abuse accountable for their offenses at both the state and federal levels. ADLâsÂ Backspace Hate initiative works to bridge these legal gaps and has had numerous successes, especially at the state level.
Establish a National Gaming Safety Task Force.
Support research efforts with additional resources.Â 
Â 

Methodology

To understand the scope of extremist content on Steam on a platform-wide scale, ADLâs quantitative analysis examined three types of media: extremist symbols (in profile and group avatars), copypasta (in multi-line text fields) and keywords (in short and long text fields). Concurrently, COE analysts conducted in-depth qualitative investigative research into users and groups of interest.

The data collection for this report aimed to capture everything publicly available on the platform as of July 2024, reaching back to the earliest data ADL researchers could retrieve for each section of research. Any content that was deleted or removed before the data collection window is not included in the study.

The hate symbol image detection research in this study was conducted using HateVision, a proprietary AI tool developed by the ADL Center on Extremism. Leveraging cutting-edge computer vision technology, HateVision is trained on a comprehensive dataset of 39 key potentially extremist and antisemitic symbols. This powerful tool rapidly scans and identifies hateful content on images and videos, enabling researchers to analyze vast amounts of multimodal data and detect hate, extremism and antisemitism with high precision. A full methodology section is included here.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-statement-regarding-modern-day-pogrom-amsterdam,"Scores of Israelis Hunted Down, Brutally Assaulted in Antisemitic Attack in Amsterdam

Â 

New York, NY, November 8, 2024 ... ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today expressed its deep horror and outrage at the violent, widespread, and apparently premeditated and coordinated antisemitic attack on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam, following a game between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax last night.Â 

Â 

Scores of Israelis were hunted down, brutally assaulted and injured. The attackersâ own videos showed Israelis fearfully scrambling to find safety amidst the violent mob, including some who hid for hours, or reportedly jumped into canals to save themselves. Although this incident followed a soccer match in Europe, it could easily have occurred at any event or on any street worldwide, given the depth and urgency of the global tsunami of antisemitism targeting Jews, Israelis, and Zionists. This includes the support and celebration of terrorism by groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, which are justified and tolerated in various regions, including the U.S. and beyond.Â 

Â 

ADL CEO and National Director, Jonathan Greenblatt, said:Â 

âThis is what âglobalize the intifadaâ looks like. It is particularly haunting that on the eve of Kristallnacht (the November 1938 pogrom in Germany), Jews on the streets of Amsterdam were hunted, chased, attacked and forced to hide from an antisemitic mob whose goal was to harm as many Jews as possible.â

Â 

We welcome the strong condemnations from Dutch leaders, including the poignant statement by King Willem-Alexander, who said âlast night we failed the Jews again.â However, more must be done by authorities in Amsterdam, and indeed around the world to protect Jews from this violent hatred.Â Â Â 

Â 

We call on authorities to take immediate action:

Dutch authorities must openly examine:

The preparation of law enforcement â before, during and after the match, how the mobilization of anti-Israel groups who conducted this assault was not disrupted, and account for how this attack persisted for hours, with Israelis running and hiding in fear for their lives, without adequate protection from police.
Â 

Given the extent of the rampage and violence, the number of detentions to date is alarming low.Â  Authorities must take decisive and immediate action to identify and detain all those responsible, and to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law, sending a clear message that hate and violence will not be tolerated and that perpetrators will be held fully accountable.Â 

European authorities must conduct an intensive investigation into who organized this attack, through what social media and other channels and with what support, including the possibility of non-Dutch instigators.

Sports officials around the globe, in soccer and other sports, must respond to this horrifying assault by committing to proudly playing with Israeli teams â in Israel and around the world.Â Â  The answer to this hate and violence cannot be the sidelining and canceling of Israeli teams and athletes which sadly has been already happening since October 7.Â 

Sports federations, along with law enforcement agencies, must develop strong protocols for protections for fans inside and outside of stadiums and for responding to violence of any kind with a focus on antisemitism.Â 

Governments and civil society must make clear that there is no justification, no tolerance, no excuse for antisemitism, period.Â  Too many are looking the other way at clear-cut support for violence and hate, without concern of the real-life consequences.Â 

Editorâs Note: There are conflicting reports from authorities in Amsterdam as to the exact number of Israelis who were chased. Law enforcement say the number may have been in the hundreds, and not thousands, as initially reported. This statement has been updated to âscoresâ to reflect the latest information available.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-commends-congress-prioritizing-investigation-campus-antisemitism,"House committee finds ""stunning failures"" at several colleges and universities in confronting antisemitism

Â 

New York, NY, October 30, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today commended the House Committee on Education and the Workforce for its investigation into the antisemitism that has taken colleges and universities by storm since the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7, 2023. The committeeâs investigation found that the leadership of several institutions failed to confront rampant antisemitism on their campuses and prioritize the safety of Jewish students.

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO, issued the following statement:

We applaud Congress for continuing to exercise its oversight authority to investigate the antisemitism Jewish students are facing across the country and hold colleges and universities accountable. Â 

No student should face hatred at school, but since Oct. 7, the antisemitic vitriol, intimidation and violence in classrooms and on campuses has been unrelenting.Â 

In the year following Hamasâ October 7th attack against Israel,â¯ADL has recorded over 1,200 antisemitic incidents on college and university campuses in the United States. In the same period a year before, ADL recorded about 200 incidents, representing a 500-percent increase.Â 

Todayâs report from Congress shines a light on many of the issues ADL has been sounding an alarm on for the past year. Administrators have the responsibility to protect their students â yet they too often fail to enforce their own policies and codes of conduct, frequently allowing offenders to face little to no accountability by compromising on disciplinary actions for those who violate policies.Â 

Due to the rising crisis of antisemitism in educational spaces, Â ADL launched the new Ronald Birnbaum Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) today. CCAE will prioritize a whole-of-society approach to countering antisemitism in education â harnessing ADLâs research, advocacy, litigation, monitoring and outreach to drive meaningful action to change the education ecosystem and protect students.Â 

Congress and the Administration must take swift action to protect students on campus.Â  Congress should urgently pass the Countering Antisemitism Act and the Antisemitism Awareness Act which would give government the tools to more effectively combat the campus antisemitism crisis this report documents. In order to ensure the Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights can protect studentsâ rights, safety, and welcoming, Congress must ensure that it hasÂ sufficient resources.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/major-social-media-platforms-have-weakened-rules-against-spread-election,"New York, NY, October 31, 2024, â¦Â  WhileÂ false and misleading election narratives are surging on social media in the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, major platforms have weakened their rules against disseminating election misinformation, according to a new ADLÂ (Anti-Defamation League) report.Â Researchers at the ADL Center for Technology and Society (CTS)Â have also found that some platforms â primarily XÂ (formerly Twitter) â have rolled back enforcement against hateful election misinformation.Â 

Ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential election,Â a flood of narratives has surged that rehash antisemitic tropes and push anti-immigrant misinformation and ADL researchers evaluated whether the four key platforms where hateful election misinformation was found (X, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube) implemented any ofÂ ADLâs previous recommendations or made other changes to their policies or enforcement.Â 

âOnce again, extremists and conspiracy theorists are leveraging social media platforms to spread false election narratives targeting marginalized groups, in particular Jews and immigrants,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âThese narratives that include claims that Jews or Israel secretly control U.S. elections are not only false and grotesque but also dangerous. We call on social media platforms to act now to protect all communities and to ensure that hateful election misinformation is never tolerated.â

ADL found that these four platforms continue to make exceptions for some kinds of misinformation, such as false allegations of past voter fraud, and that their policies are generally insufficient to prevent coordinated disinformation campaigns, such as users knowingly spreading fringe conspiracy theories. Moreover, no platform allows sufficient data access for independent researchers to study the extent of misinformation or rules enforcement. In fact, X and RedditÂ curtailed data access for researchers in 2023.Â 

Additionally, many platforms rolled back policies against delegitimizing elections in two key areas: rules against claiming early victory and rules against false narratives about past elections. One positive change though was that all four platforms now appear to prohibit threats against election workers, including harassment and threatening violence (a policy that TikTok already had in place).Â 

As of publication, no platform took action on the hateful election misinformation examples ADL reported. ADL also found that the user reporting options in some cases do not match a given platformâs policies. This was especially evident on TikTok and on X.Â 

The report includes detailed recommendations for social media platforms:

Reinstate prior policies: Rolling back rules against false claims of past fraud or declaring early victory undermines efforts to curb hateful election misinformation. Rumors targeting immigrants and Jews undermine electoral integrity and democracy and put targeted groups at risk, fueling antisemitism and potentially political violence.
Enforce rules consistently and equitably: Policies are only as good as their enforcement. Platforms must scale the resources necessary to identify and remove prohibited election misinformation, including automated and human review. High profile accounts such as political officials or candidates should not be exempt; on the contrary, because of their influence, they should be held to higher standards.
Ensure user reporting matches policy: TikTok, X/Twitter, and others must make available to users the complete list of prohibited misinformation through the reporting interface (such as through a link to the full policy details).
Respond to user reports of election misinformation: ADLâs recent research shows that platforms increasingly do not act on regular user reports, relying instead either on their own proactive detection (often automated) or on reports from reputable organizations like ADL, as part of âtrusted flaggerâ programs. Users can play an important role in preventing the spread of hateful misinformation, especially narratives that require human interpretation to detect, such as those that depend on context or implicit information.Â  Â 
Apply election rules year-round:Â Election misinformation does not end after an election; on the contrary, hateful false narratives can grow and develop further, and lead to political violence as they did on January 6, 2021.
Data access for researchers: Restore (or establish) free or low-cost research APIs for independent researchers that allow for random samples of all content, not just libraries of curated content or top posts.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/pflp-charity-arm-samidoun-has-long-played-role-anti-israel-movement-us-campuses,"Anti-Zionist group Samidoun, sanctioned by the U.S. in October 2024 for its role as a âsham charityâ operating as an international fundraising arm of the U.S. government-designated terror organization the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), has long played a role in the anti-Israel movement on U.S. campuses. The group, which the U.S. considers to be a front for the PFLP in countries where it is declared a terrorist organization, has been featured as a âpro-Palestinianâ resource for years on some university websites such as City University of New York (CUNY) and California Institute of the Arts. Its representatives have also been invited for speaking engagements at campus events on several occasions.

Since the October 7 Hamas-led terror attack in Israel, in which the PFLP took part, Samidoun has co-sponsored several protests and events across the U.S. -- alongside groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) -- that have featured some of the most extreme pro-terror rhetoric and messaging in the anti-Israel space. These protests have also included instances of harassment and at least one on-campus event where activists engaged in the physical assault of Jews.

A March 2024 webinar at Columbia University featured Samidoun leader Khaled Barakat, who spoke of his ties to designated terror groups and lauded the October 7 attack. Barakat was personally sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury earlier this month for his role as a PFLP leadership member and fundraiser.

Protests and events

Perhaps the most egregious incident involving Samidoun on university campuses occurred on September 3, 2024, when a protest at Baruch College led to a reported assault of a Hillel staff member and harassment of Jewish students, who were reportedly called âbaby killersâ and told to go âback to Brooklyn.â The protest was cosponsored by Samidoun, SJP Baruch, SJP affiliate PSA Hunter College, John Jay SJP, SJP CCNY, Baruch College Middle Eastern and North African Society and New York City Revolutionary Youth.

It was held to target Hillel, the largest Jewish student organization on campus, and call for CUNY to âcut tiesâ with the group. Just one day after the funeral of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli hostage who was executed by Hamas in late August alongside five other abductees, one of the protestors was filmed yelling at Jewish students, âWhereâs Hersh, you ugly ass bitch?â

Another disturbing incident involving Samidoun occurred at Columbia University in March 2024 when student activists hosted a webinar called âResistance 101.â The online event featured Barakat, his spouse Charlotte Kates who serves as Samidounâs Canada-based international coordinator and National SJP Steering Committee member Sean Eren. During the webinar, Barakat referred to âmy friends and brothers in Hamas, Islamic Jihad, you know, the PFLP in Gazaâ and praised the âAl Aqsa Flood operation,â Hamasâs name for the October 7, 2023 attack.

Another noteworthy incident on campus occurred on March 29, 2024, when a PFLP flag was displayed at a banner drop at the University of Washington cosponsored by Samidoun, Palestinian Youth Movement, Global Solidarity Network Seattle, Healthcare Workers for Palestine and Support the Palestinian Voice.

In other instances, speakers affiliated with Samidoun have been panelists at events on campus.Â  For example, in November 2023, Kates was advertised as a panelist at an event titled âTeach In: Contexts And Histories Of Palestinian Resistanceâ at City University of New York. A year prior, in November 2022, a page for an event hosted by New York Universityâs law school stated that among the panelists was âHussein from the NY/NJ chapter of Samidoun,â who is referred to as one speaker among âother U.S.-based abolitionist organizers.â

In November 2024, the radical anti-Zionist group New York Revolutionary Youth posted a photo from Sarah Lawrence College's fall encampment of a flag bearing the Samidoun logo and the image of convicted terrorist Georges Abdallah, formerly with the PFLP, who was sentenced to life in prison in France for the 1982 murders in Paris of an Israeli diplomat and an American military attachÃ©. The photo was reposted by far-left anti-Zionist network Unity of Fields, formerly Palestine Action U.S.

Â 

Samidounâs platforming on university websites

Several U.S. university websites contain pages that promote Samidoun as a pro-Palestinian resource or advertise past events that have featured the fundraising arm of the PFLP. Of note, the California Institute of the Arts website contains a page from April 2024 titled âResources for Palestinian Liberationâ that features Samidoun under Grassroots Media Outlets. Other examples include:

Fall 2024, City University of New York (CUNY): In the editorial introduction to the Fall 2024 issue of the CUNY Graduate Centerâs student-published, peer-reviewed journal, Theory, Research, and Action in Urban Education, the editors reference âthe critical work of organizations to free political prisoners such as Jericho and Samidoun.â
May 2021, University of Illinois, Chicago: âA Statement of Solidarity with Palestine from the UIC Global Asian Studies Programâ encourages readers to contact Samidoun to promote their events in support of a Palestinian strike.
December 2020: The Orfalea Center for Global & International Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara includes a link to Samidounâs website and Facebook page, in a list of Resources and Organizations on a page titled Structural Violence, Police/Prison Abolition, and Decoloniality.

Recommendations

University leadership nationwide must ensure that Samidoun, like all proxies for U.S.-designated terror organizations, has no place on campus. Allowing such groups to influence the campus environment â including campus-based protests â risks normalizing terrorism and threatens the safety of Jewish students and all members of the campus community. It is critical that policies designed to address the influence of such external actors are developed and strictly enforced. College campuses must not become places where extremist agendas and ideologies flourish.

Campus-based support for terrorist organizations is just one of the trends ADL is actively tracking in the campus anti-Israel movement.

The Center to Combat Antisemitism in Education (CCAE) will be led byÂ Shira Goodman, a leader with deep experience in education policy and advocacy. Goodman will collaborate with a team of ADL staff dedicated to campus and K-12 advocacy, curriculum development and stakeholder engagement.

Named in memory of the father of a longtime ADL supporter, CCAE will house all of ADLâs initiatives to combat antisemitism in K-12 schools and on college campuses. CCAE will pursue every available lever â from collaboration and consultation to partnerships, lobbying and litigation -- to respond to antisemitism across the education ecosystem.

âWeâre so proud of the work ADL does every day to counter antisemitism in schools and on campuses across the country,â said Goodman. âThis center will allow us to scale those efforts to serve even more students and their families by driving impact in more classrooms and on more campuses.â

The initiative will also leverage ADLâs regional offices, ensuring local partnerships and national impact.

ADLâs new center will rise to this challenge by prioritizing work in several key areas:

Enhancing Safety: Providing strategies to improve the emotional and physical well-being of Jewish students, faculty and staff, ensuring they are welcomed and included in their educational communities.
Holding Educational Institutions Accountable: Ensuring there are consequences for inaction and leveraging all available tools to ensure educational institutions meet the moment.
Countering All forms of Antisemitic Extremism: Actively disrupting antisemitic and anti-Israel groups and dismantling their harmful influence in K-12 and higher education spaces.
Empowering Jewish Communities and Allies: Equipping Jewish leaders and their allies with tools, resources and training to advocate effectively against antisemitism.

CCAE will stress accountability by producing the ADLÂ Campus Antisemitism Report Card, raising awareness, and ensuring officials exercise oversight to drive meaningful change; will offer legal support through ADLâsÂ Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL); and will leverage tools like Title VI complaints to hold schools and universities accountable.

A recent ADLÂ report found that during the 2023-2024 school year, anti-Israel incidents on campuses in the United States increased 477 percent, including 360 instances of harassment, 201 instances of vandalism and 28 assaults. Additionally, ADLâs annualÂ Audit of Antisemitic Incidents found that antisemitic incidents in non-Jewish K-12 schools increased 135 percent from 2022 to 2023.Â

Urges other institutions to follow suit as it reassesses Report Card grades

New York, NY, October 30, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today commended 10 colleges and universities for their recent efforts and policies to address campus antisemitism. Since the initial release of ADLâsÂ Campus Antisemitism Report Card in April of 2024, and a subsequent update in June following the protest encampments, these institutions have taken proactive steps to foster a more inclusive environment for Jewish students and all students.

Almost all assessed colleges and universities have revised their protest, demonstration and time, place and manner policies in advance of the new academic year. Additionally, at least over 50% of these schools have enacted other major changes, including establishing task forces, mandating antisemitism education and ameliorating bias incident reporting and investigation processes.

In letters to the presidents of each of the institutions, ADL praised the schools for their progress in working to combat antisemitism on campus. In alignment with ADLâs Six Asks for combating antisemitism on college and university campuses, these 10 institutions have implemented a number of critical policies:

Alongside new procedures for campus demonstrations, the University of PennsylvaniaÂ has developed workshops on combating antisemitism and hate for members of the campus community and established the Office of Religious and Ethnic Inclusion.
University of Michigan has streamlined their system for responding to bias incidents, has hired a Title VI coordinator to support the Universityâs response to reports of discrimination or harassment and is in the process of developing a mandatory anti-discrimination training.
Strengthening collaborative efforts, Michigan State University has convened a monthly gathering of colleagues to discuss issues of student safety. The University has also launched a DEI Foundations learning module that includes discussions of antisemitism.
SUNY Purchaseâs new âDiversity Definedâ resource firmly prohibits antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination, while simultaneously rejecting BDS.
Prioritizing research efforts, CUNY Queens College has sought to assess antisemitism on campus through surveys and focus groups. The College is also working with theÂ Jewish Community Relations Council Community Security Initiative to improve public safety.
CUNY Brooklyn College has strengthened campus protest policies, organized regular Emergency Response Team meetings and has developed new orientation training that addresses antisemitism.
In advance of the new academic year, the University of Colorado, Boulder amended its protected-class definitions webpage to explicitly prohibit antisemitism, Islamophobia and caste. This month, the University also de-recognized the campus SJP chapter.
Barnard College amended the Expectations for Community Conduct policy to note that âsubstituting the word âZionistâ as a proxy for âJewishâ or âIsraeli,â for example, may constitute prohibited discrimination.â
Wellesley CollegeÂ is providing anti-religious bias training to all residential life and orientation staffÂ and has mandated Title VI training for all first years and other incoming students.
New York University has launched a university-wide mandatory training that includes examples of conduct that would be considered discrimination against Jews or Israelis. The University was also the first to update its policy to explicitly underscore that code words like âZionistâ could result in conduct violations.

âWhen we first launched the Campus Antisemitism Report Card, we urged university leaders to use the grades they received as motivation to do better and improve their scores, and in the cases of these 10 schools the progress has been demonstrable,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âThese universitiesâ recent efforts and policies should lay the foundation for continued progress and should serve as a model for other schools to follow.â

ADL encourages these schools, and all colleges and universities, to continue their efforts in the ongoing fight against campus antisemitism, both via policy changes and through the consistent and balanced enforcement of said policies. Doing so sends an important message to their campus communities: antisemitism has no place on our campuses.

âWe encourage these schools, and all colleges and universities, to continue their efforts in the ongoing fight against campus antisemitism,â said Shira Goodman, ADL Vice President of Advocacy. âThere is much more work to be done to ensure that our campuses have no tolerance for antisemitism.â","[3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.8, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/antisemitism-campus-student-becomes-empowered-through-adl,"As a freshman at Tulane University, Marley woke up one morning to texts from family and friends asking if she was ok. From her dorm room, she heard chants of âfree Palestine,â âgenocide supportersâ and âfrom the river to the sea.â It was late October 2023. She walked over to an anti-Israel protest on campus and soon realized it wasnât peaceful, but filled with tension and calls for the destruction of Israel and Jewish people. A red pickup truck sped by with a group of men holding a lighter to an Israeli flag. One of Marleyâs friends tried to grab the flag out of their hands. His nose ended up broken after he was hit in the face with a megaphone.

It was the first time Marley felt threatened as a Jewish college student, though she continued proudly to wear her Jewish star.

âAs the days went on and my friendâs nose was healing, I thought back to my path of becoming a person who believes in the need for social justice. For four years I was a teen mentor for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). I encountered antisemitism from an early age. I felt confused and saddened, struggling to understand why someone disliked me without even knowing me,â Marley wrote.

After the anti-Israel protest, she and her Jewish friends found solace in community, being there for one another and spending Shabbats together at Hillel or Chabad. As the campus protests and encampments escalated in the spring, Marley realized addressing a lack of education about the issues is key.

Back in her hometown in Connecticut after the school year ended, she was disappointed and angry that the community wasnât raising awareness around antisemitism. She felt compelled to do something and reached out to ADL, remembering her experiences as a teen mentor.

Once she became an ADL summer intern, she felt better equipped to remain calm in the face of upsetting comments. She learned how to counter antisemitism through her work at ADL such as strategies and specific language to use when faced with that hate.

Marley is back on campus for her sophomore year. She said it feels good to be there. Every Sunday, there is a walk when participants wear Israeli flags, carry signs of the hostages and read out their names. She described it as peaceful and as a way to show support for Israel and raise awareness.

She has already spent Shabbats at Chabad, even showing up early to help set up and spend time with the rabbi and his family. She hopes to continue surrounding herself within the Jewish community.

As cases of antisemitism soar in the UK, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have launched a new free digital resource to teach secondary school students about Jews, Judaism and antisemitism. This initiative addresses the urgent need for improved anti-hate educational programs in schools, especially given the worrying increase in antisemitic incidents among younger demographics.

Jewish Living Online (JLO), developed by the Board of Deputies of British Jews in partnership with ADL, is a comprehensive, authentic and engaging resource for students aged 11 and over. It provides information via multimedia content (including real British Jewish voices), discussion, and critical thinking questions and assessment tools.Â 

The first iteration is designed to fit in with the standard curriculum for KS3 (11-14 years) and above. There are plans to expand the project to include Welsh, Scottish, and Northern Irish variants in compliance with their respective national guidelines and language requirements.

The unique technology stack was developed in-house by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and will form the foundation of future work by the Board and partners in the online education space. A future teacher training module for JLO is also planned.

ADL CEO and National Director, Jonathan Greenblatt, said:Â 

""Unfortunately, the UK is no exception to the global tsunami of antisemitism we've witnessed over the past year. To combat this rise in hatred, ADL is proud to launch Jewish Living Online in partnership with the Board of Deputies of British Jews. This initiative marks the first of many similar programs we plan to implement globally, aimed at educating and empowering the next generation. By providing teachers and students with essential tools to understand and confront antisemitism, we are taking a vital step toward a future where antisemitism and hate have no place in our communities.""

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/adl-debunk-false-narratives-around-2024-presidential-election,"False and misleading narratives about the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election are spreading widely among extremists and purveyors of hate and conspiracy theories.

While some of the most common mis- and disinformation narratives circulating today were also prominent during theÂ 2020 election and theÂ 2022 midterms, others are newer â inspired by current events in America and around the world. These narratives are also being deployed using a range of strategies and tactics that allow misleading content to fly under the radar.

Strategies and tactics

Foreign influence campaigns have already impacted the information landscape surrounding the election. In one recent and notable case, the Department of Justice seized 32 internet domains created by the Russian government to spread propaganda and disinformation in an operation colloquially known as Doppelganger, which aimed in part to influence voter sentiment in foreign elections and the U.S. presidential election, according to a September 2024 Justice DepartmentÂ announcement.

Many of the domains were created via âcybersquatting,â or registering misleading domains disguised as legitimate news websites. In the case of Doppelganger, these domains used trademarked logos and even the bylines of real journalists to spread fabricated articles â some of which promoted narratives related to how the U.S. government handles foreign and domestic issues and security threats.

Â 

One of the Doppelganger projects specifically targeted American citizens in swing states, âUS citizens of Hispanic descent,â âAmerican Jewsâ and âAmerican gamersâ on sites like Reddit and 4chan. Another campaign aimed to sway public opinion among the Jewish diaspora in the U.S. and Israel by framing Ukraine as a neo-Nazi-aligned enemy and drawing ""parallels between Russia and Israel."" One part of the planning document reads, ""influencing the public opinion of Israel will impact the public opinion of Jewish voters in the US.â

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) content has also been weaponized to spread election-related disinformation. In January 2024,Â robocalls using synthetic speech of President Joe Bidenâs voice discouraged New Hampshire voters from voting in the primary election, which was scheduled two days later. In a February 2024Â statement, the New Hampshire Attorney Generalâs office called the maneuver a form of âvoter suppression.â

Â 

On January 31, 2024, pollster Patrick Ruffini posted what appeared to be photos of Black men canvassing for the Republican party with a caption on X that read: âRepublican victory in 2024 depends on their being able to do this.â The images, however, wereÂ AI-generated â a tactic that many users mocked and denounced after the fact. After widespread ridicule, Ruffini deleted the post.

Â 

One problematic side effect of increasingly convincing GAI content is the ability for people to cast doubt on the validity of authentic content â a phenomenon often referred to asÂ âthe liarâs dividend,â which is also contributing to misinformation campaigns.

In August 2024, conspiratorial influencers suggested that images of the crowd at a Kamala Harris rally in Michigan were CGI or AI-generated, in a supposed effort by her campaign to inflate her popularity. This claim is easilyÂ debunkable â the rally was covered by numerous media outlets, the photographs in question are available on sites like Getty Images and journalists reported thousands of people in the crowd.

Regardless of the method by which they are spread, false and misleading election narratives are designed to achieve a common goal: To sow distrust in the democratic process and call into question the validity of the election results.

The ADL Center on Extremism has tracked the following prominent false narratives surrounding the upcoming election.
Â 
False narratives about the 2024 election

FALSE NARRATIVE #1: Immigrants are helping Democrats steal the election

One of the most popular election fraud narratives alleges that large volumes of non-citizens have successfully registered to vote and are helping to âstealâ the election in favor of Kamala Harris. Some have claimed that the Biden administration has been deliberately coordinating the influx of migrants to help achieve this goal.

Â 

In early September 2024, extremists and conspiracy theorists spread the false narrative that Haitian migrant communities in Springfield, Ohio, were killing and eating domestic pets. While not overtly election-related at first, the false claim quickly gained traction as political fodder â in most cases, to fuel the theory that Haitian migrants were specifically imported into swing states by the Biden administration to ensure a Harris win.

Â 

Conspiracy theorists have also expressed concerns about a lack of âvoter IDâ laws â as in, laws requiring voters to present valid ID at polling places, regardless of their prior registration status. Many claim that Democrats are outlawing these requirements because it will allow non-citizens to vote and make the election easier to steal.

REALITY:Â These claims are unfounded and advance the broader narrative that the election is being systematically rigged while demonizing innocent migrant communities. Undocumented migrants or migrants who are not U.S. citizensÂ cannot legally register to vote, and therefore cannot influence election results. Also, eligible voters already go through a thorough identification process when they initially register. In several states like California â where âvoter IDâ laws have been highly debated â registered voters areÂ not typically required to bring additional identification to polling places when they cast their ballots.

FALSE NARRATIVE #2: Jews, Zionists and Israel control the election results

A common talking point among antisemitic extremists and conspiracy theorists has long been that JewsÂ control the U.S. government. Now, these groups are also promoting the false narrative that Jews, Zionists and Israel control U.S. elections.

Members of extremist groups, including neo-Nazis and white supremacists, have suggested that the winning candidate will ultimately be determined by âthe Jews.â Antisemitic influencerÂ Lucas Gage recently suggested that so-called âJewish supremacyâ is such a systemic issue across all candidates that voting is futile and that only an alternative political system can combat its influence.

Â 

Across the political spectrum, influencers have also suggested that Israel is meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Sulaiman Ahmed, anÂ anti-Zionist commentator and promoter of anti-Israel disinformation, alleged that Israel forced Joe Biden out of the 2024 presidential race to assert its control over the U.S.

Â 

REALITY: These false claims are merely iterations of classicÂ antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and control. Extremists and antisemites spread them to corroborate the false narrative that there is a disproportionate influence of Jewish power in American politics, weaponizing the current discourse surrounding Israel to validate their claims.

FALSE NARRATIVE #3: Kamala Harris lied about her identity, credibility and eligibility to run for president

After Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July 2024, some conspiracy theorists alleged that he was illegitimately removed by the Democratic Party to more convincingly âstealâ the election from Republican contender Donald Trump. This claim helped fuel the many narratives disputing Kamala Harrisâs eligibility as a presidential candidate.

Many questioned her credibility by sowing doubt in her status as an American citizen, invoking claims like the âbirtherâ theories that surrounded former president Barack Obama. ThisÂ accusation against Harris also circulated during the 2020 election cycle.

Â 

Far-right commentator Matt Walsh pushed a sexist talking point by suggesting she âslept her way to the top,â while others questioned her identity as a Black woman. Conspiracy theorists also latched onto the narrative that Harrisâs campaign is part of a media-coordinated âpsyop,â claiming that the media has somehow fabricated Harrisâs popularity to make her look like a more formidable opponent.

Â 

REALITY:Â Harris is, in fact, an American citizen. She wasÂ born in California and identifies as bothÂ Black and Asian-American. False claims alleging that she âslept her wayâ to her current status are common misogynistic tropes, typically used to discredit women in positions of power.

FALSE NARRATIVE #4: The Trump assassination attempts were staged or âinside jobsâ

On July 13, 2024,Â Thomas Matthew Crooks carried out an assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Two months later, on September 15, 2024, the FBI thwarted another assassination attempt on Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida by Ryan Wesley Routh, who was arrested at the scene.

Left-wing conspiracy theorists quickly cast doubt on the authenticity of the well-documented incidents, suggesting that Trumpâs own associates staged the attempts as a campaign strategy. In far-right and extremist spaces online, users suggested that the Democratic Party, Israel, âJewsâ or theÂ âdeep stateâÂ carried out the attempts themselves.

Â 

REALITY:Â There isÂ no evidence supporting the claims that the assassination attempts against Trump were fake, nor is there any indication that they were planned by anyone but the would-be assassins themselves. Such narratives are common among conspiracy theorists following newsworthy or violent incidents, which they leverage to promote their own political ideologies.

FALSE NARRATIVE #5: The government is weaponizing or creating hurricanes to interfere with the electionÂ 

In late September 2024, Hurricane Helene swept through the southeast, hitting states like Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. Severe flooding decimated parts of western North Carolina, leading toÂ widespread damage, power outages and even deaths.

Conspiracy theories about the hurricane and the Federal Emergency Management Agencyâs (FEMA) response emerged shortly after. Far-right commentators like Jack Posobiec capitalized on the opportunity to politicize the subject, suggesting that the government was blocking relief and aid to victims of Helene as a form of âvoter suppression.â On X, Islamophobic commentatorÂ Laura Loomer asked if the aftermath was part of âplanned mass chaosâ from the Biden administration.

Â 

Some suggested the hurricane itself was a product of a nefarious weather control conspiracy. Antisemitic influencer Stew Peters expressed his suspicion that the federal government âlearned how to manipulate weatherâ to target âmostly white, Republican votersâ right before the election. Similar theories continued to spread around October 9, 2024, when Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida.

Â 

REALITY:Â FEMA and the U.S. government are notÂ restricting aid to Hurricane Helene victims; this was one of many conspiracy theories about FEMA in the wake of Helene, which prompted the organization to set up a dedicatedÂ âHurricane Rumor Responseâ page on their website. The government was not involved in the production orÂ manipulation of these hurricanes, as humansÂ cannot control or create extreme weather phenomena.

FALSE NARRATIVE #6: âBallot traffickingâ or âballot harvestingâ will lead to large volumes of fraudulent ballots

Widely popularized in 2020, this theory suggests that surveillance footage from recent elections shows evidence of individuals depositing large quantities of fraudulent ballots in drop boxes to falsely inflate votes for a single candidate. This narrative was also prevalent during theÂ 2022 midterms, leading to organized âdrop box monitoringâÂ parties. The claim continues to be promoted ahead of November.

Â 

REALITY:Â These theories have been widely debunked. Footage of alleged âballot traffickingâ shows voters taking part in the normal process of placing ballots in local drop box locations. It is not unusual for an individual to drop off several ballots at once; inÂ most states, family members or other authorized individuals may drop off a ballot for someone who is not able to do so on their own.

FALSE NARRATIVE #7: Delayed election results are false election results

This longstanding election fraud narrative, popular in both 2020 and 2022, suggests that delays in reporting election results are evidence of nefarious behind-the-scenes attempts to swing the election. Promoters of this theory, which include QAnon adherents and general election fraud conspiracy theorists, have argued that these delays make it easier to commit election fraud and give bad actors more time to tamper with ballots.

Â 

REALITY:Â Laws determining when and how election workers can start processing votes vary by state.Â Alabama, for example, does not allow the counting of absentee or mail-in ballots to begin until after the polls close on election day. These rulesÂ can also changeÂ between election cycles if amendments are made to existing laws.

FALSE NARRATIVE #8: Electronic voting machines are programmed to change votesÂ 

Around October 18, 2024, new allegations supposedly from early voters in Georgia suggested that Dominion voting machines were switching their Trump votes to Harris votes.

Â 

REALITY:Â This theory is not new and was repeatedlyÂ debunked when it first circulated in 2020. Dominion has sinceÂ addressed and dispelled the recent allegations, citing âvoter errorâ as the cause.

FALSE NARRATIVE #9: Michigan has more registered voters than citizens, suggesting fraud

On October 19, 2024, viral posts on sites like X, Rumble and more alleged that the state of Michigan has more registered voters than eligible citizens, implying that the state is at heightened risk of voter fraud. One post spreading this claim received at least 30 million views.

Â 

REALITY:Â Michigan Secretary of StateÂ Jocelyn Benson debunked the narrative shortly after it emerged, clarifying that Michigan has â7.2 million active registered voters and 7.9 [million] citizens of voting age.â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/francesca-albanese-her-own-words,"Francesca Albanese, appointed in May 2022 as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, has long coopted antisemitic tropes and legitimized support of terrorism in her critiques of Israel, using her platform to spread intense anti-Israel rhetoric. She is the first Special Rapporteur to be condemned by both Germany and France for antisemitism, and has been condemned by the U.S. Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and U.S. Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council, MichÃ¨le Taylor.Â 

Â 

UN Human Rights Council Special Procedures Mandate-holders or Special Rapporteurs, are independent experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, tasked with investigating human rights in an area or topic. Special Rapporteurs are bound by their Code of Conduct to, â...ensure that their personal political opinions are without prejudice to the execution of their mission, and base their conclusions and recommendations on objective assessments of human rights situations.â Special Rapporteurs must also, âIn implementing their mandate, therefore, show restraint, moderation and discretion so as not to undermine the recognition of the independent nature of their mandate or the environment necessary to properly discharge the said mandate.â From the start Francesca Albaneseâs bias and lack of impartiality towards Israel has been obvious. She has a long record of promoting antisemitic tropes and using hateful language to attack the Jewish State of Israel, which includes comparing Israel to the Nazis, conspiracies about Jewish power, denying and diminishing the Oct 7th massacre, and supporting and advocating violence against the Jewish state.Â Â 

Â 

Below are select antisemitic and/or inflammatory statements from Albanese:Â 

Â 

Holocaust Distortion, Trivialization and Comparisons to Nazis

On October 14, 2024, Albanese likened the systematic extermination of Jews under the Naziâs âpure raceâ policy to Israelâs war on Hamas in Gaza. Albanese compares the Jewish Stateâs war against Hamas, to the âThird Reichâ who perpetrated the Holocaust, tweeting: âOur collective obliviousness to what led, 100 years ago, to the Third Reichâs expansionism and the genocide of people not in conformity with the âpure raceâ is asinine. And it is leading to the commission of yet another genocide...â

In August 2024, in a tweet addressed to the German government, Albanese likened Germanyâs actions and German civilianâs complacency during the Holocaust under the Third Reich, to Germanyâs support of Israel claiming, âThis is 2024 and while you could stay quite [sic] and silent in the corner of history, you are doing all you can to make it wrong, once again.âÂ 

In August 2024, Albanese likened Israelâs war on the Gaza strip to the Holocaust, calling it a âconcentration camp of the 21st century.â

In July 2024, Albanese trivialized the Holocaust, reposting an image comparing Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, with the comment: âThis is precisely what I was thinking today.â

In December 2023, Albanese compared the Israelâs war in Gaza to the Holocaust saying: âFellow Europeans, Italians, Germans: after the Holocaust, we should instinctively know that Genocide starts with dehumanizing the Other. If Israel's current attack agst [sic] Palestinians doesnt [sic] prompt our strong reaction, the darkest page of our recent history has taught us nothing.âÂ 

Conspiracies about Jewish power

October 2024, Albanese retweeted with the caption âA must-read for the ages...â a tweet from Chris Hedges that read: âI fear, given that the Israel lobby has bought and paid for Congress and the two ruling parties, as well as cowed the media and universities, the rivers of blood will continue to swell. There is money to be made in war. A lot of it. And the influence of the war industry, buttressed by hundreds of millions of dollars spent on political campaigns by the Zionists, will be a formidable barrier to peace, not to mention sanity.âÂ Â 

Demonization and Delegitimization of Israel

In August 2024, Albanese labeled the targeted Israeli assassinations of terrorist leaders, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr, as âmurdersâ and âacts of aggression.â

In July 2024, Albanese compared Israel to the terrorist rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan, after the Taliban banned the UN Special Rapporteur for Afghanistan from entering the country, stating: âThe Taliban displays the same disdain toward the UN and its values as Israelâs Apartheid.â In Taliban ruled Afghanistan, women are banned from speaking or showing their faces in public.

In June 2024, Albanese claimed âgenocidal intentâ in the Israeli rescue efforts to free four hostages kidnapped from Israel into Gaza by Hamas terrorists.

July 2024, Albanese tweeted âTime to #UNseatIsrael from the UN.âÂ Â 

Denying or Diminishing the Oct. 7th Massacre

In March 2024, Albanese diminished the reality and suffering of Israeli women on International Womenâs Day without reference to those who were murdered, dehumanized, kidnapped and raped by Hamas: âMy thoughts also go to the Israeli women, especially the soldiers: what have you done, what have you become. Dears, when you realise it, you will be haunted forever.â

In February 2024, in response to French President Emmanuel Macron referring to the October 7 massacre as âthe largest antisemitic massacre of our century,â Albanese tweeted: âThe greatest antisemitic massacre of our century? No, @EmmanuelMacron. The victims of 7/10 were not killed because of their Judaism but in response to Israelâs oppression.â For this statement, the governments of France and Germany condemned Albanese for her antisemitism, making it the first time in UN history that both France and Germany condemn a UN rapporteur for antisemitism.Â 

France responding: âThe October 7 massacre is the largest anti-Semitic massacre of the 21st century. To deny it is wrong. To seem to justify it, by bringing in the name of the United Nations, is a shame.â Adding that, âThese remarks are all the more scandalous given that the fight against anti-Semitism and all forms of racism are at the heart of the founding of the UN.âÂ 

Germany also replied to Albaneseâs comments, stating: âTo justify the horrific terror attacks of 7/10 & deny their antisemitic nature is appalling. Making such statements in a UN capacity is a disgrace and goes against everything the United Nations stand for.â

During a webinar, while discussing the October 7 massacre, Albanese said: âThere might have been people carrying out the attack who might have been motivated by hatred. But the attack itself, and this is the thing, there is something like intent at the level of the attack, and all the statements that were collected at the level of command have not pointed to aggression against the Jews. There is another point that in Arabic, Palestinians refer to the Israelis as Yahudis and the Israelis refer to the Palestinians like the Arabs. This is something that shouldnât escape a western audience. It is a way to refer interchangeably to the Israelis.â

In October 2023, following the brutal massacre perpetrated by Hamas, Albanese called into question Hamasâ crimes âincluding beheadings/rape.â

On October 7 2023, the day that Hamas targeted Israelâs civilian populations massacring of over 1,200 people and kidnapping 250, Albaneseâs reaction was to minimize Hamasâ atrocities stating that, âTodayâs violence must be put in context.âÂ 

Justification of Violence

In a November 2022 response to a Hamas-organized conference in Gaza, Albanese said âyou have the right to resist this occupation.â

In June 2022, Albanese stated that âThe Palestinians have no other room for dissent than violence,â justifying violence against Israel.

Upon the start of her term as Special Rapporteur in May 2022, Albanese began to justify terrorist violence stating: âThe Palestinian violence that we see is inevitable because for 55 years, almost three generations, the right to exist of a people has been denied.âÂ 

Albaneseâs antisemitism prior to her UN appointment

In 2014, in a post since hidden from her Facebook page, Albanese employs antisemitic tropes in an open letter to the BBC stating that: âThe Israeli lobby is clearly inside your veins and system,â claiming of an âorwellian [sic] nightmare caused once again by Israelâs greed.âÂ 

In 2014, Albanese expressed excitement on Facebook that Hamas was removed from the list of terror organizations by the EU General Court: âTwo good news one after another from the radio while I was taking a nap. Normalization in the relations usa cuba [sic] and removal of hamas [sic] from the list of terror organizations. Was i [sic] dreaming???â The EUâs decision to declassify Hamas as a terrorist organization was overturned by the European Court of Justice (EJC) in 2017.

In 2014, Albanese stated: âAmerica and Europe, one of them subjugated by the Jewish lobby, and the other by the sense of guilt about the Holocaust.â When uncovered in 2022, Albaneseâs comments were condemned by US Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt as âblatantly antisemitic.â Albanese has since said that she regrets this remark.","[2, 4, 5]","{1: 0.0, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.9, 6: 0.0}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/anti-israel-activists-pay-tribute-107-architect-yahya-sinwar-reflecting-pattern,"After Israeli military forces killed Hamas leader and October 7 architect Yahya Sinwar in Gaza on October 16, 2024, U.S. anti-Israel activists quickly responded with praise and veneration for the terrorist who masterminded the deaths of approximately 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals and the abduction of some 250 people just over one year ago. Student groups, including numerous chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), were among the loudest voices memorializing Sinwar with sympathetic, pro-Hamas statements and social media posts.

These openly pro-terror responses fit into a pattern of behavior from many in the anti-Israel movement who have repeatedly glorified and celebrated notorious terrorists, both online and on the ground since the October 7 attack. In recent months, in particular, similar responses have followed the assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September 2024 and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in July 2024.

This most recent wave of support for infamous terror group leaders demonstrates how, as ADL has frequently documented, many activist groups that claim to be simply âanti-Israelâ or âanti-Zionistâ in fact openly revel in violence against and the murder of civilians â and Jews in particular â in Israel.

Anti-Israel Activists Memorialize Sinwar

Student Groups

Dozens of chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and other campus groups were among those explicitly supportive of Sinwar after his death, reposting hagiographies, obituaries, and images of him with captions like âglory to our martyrsâ or ârest in power.â Some of these posts also incorporated additional violent rhetoric and imagery, including of weapons and inverted red triangles (a symbol popularized by Hamas to mark targets).

Upon the news of Sinwarâs death, students in the City University of New York (CUNY) system praised the terror chief and shared other pro-terror content in a recently launched, self-described âunapologetically pro-resistance, anonymous telegram channel,â titled âCunyResists.â The first two posts on the channel featured photographs of Sinwar and a lengthy message memorializing him and other recently killed terrorist group leaders. It read, in part:

âThe news regarding the great commander has left our hearts heavy and out [sic] chests breathless. Today, we mourn the loss and celebrate the martyrdom of the lion of Al Quds, the beloved Commander, President, Fighter, his eminence, Yahya Sinwarâ¦Every kuffiyeh drawn on the neck of a CUNY student is tied to the neck of the great commander who woke up the world from their deep daze. We tell the Zionist entity that your assassinations have never worked in the past and they will not work today. From Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin [Hamas founder, killed in 2004] to Sheikh Ismael Haniyah. Hundreds more will rise to take their placeâ¦Indeed it is a Jihad of victory or martyrdom.â

University of Washington SJP-affiliate Students United for Palestinian Equality & Return (SUPER) reposted a pro-Hamas statement about Sinwar from Samidoun â an anti-Israel organization recently sanctioned by the U.S. government for acting as an âinternational fundraiserâ for the U.S.-designated terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) â with the message âGlory to the martyr Yahya Sinwar.âÂ

Â 

The Philadelphia SJP coalition â which consists of anti-Israel student groups from Bryn Mawr College, Drexel University, Haverford College, Swarthmore College, Temple University, the University of Pennsylvania and Villanova University â reposted a biography of Sinwar and added the caption: âWe will honor all our martyrs. It is right to resist.â Central Florida SJP, which is active at but not officially recognized by the University of Central Florida, shared a Sinwar interview clip with the added caption: âGlory to our martyrs.â

SJP at the University of Virginia posted a photograph of Sinwar pulling a pistol from his waistband, overlaid with the text: âPeace be upon you, a prisoner, a leader, a fighter, a martyr.â At the University of California, Berkeley, the schoolâs SJP chapter also posted the image of Sinwar with the pistol and other messages glorifying Sinwar, while Bears for Palestine, another anti-Israel student group, posted an image of Sinwar kneeling with a rifle.

The SJP chapter at California State University, Los Angeles, reposted a tweet reading, âOne manâs terrorist is another manâs freedom fighter.â At Cal Poly Pomona, the campus SJP reposted an interview of Sinwar, captioning it: âThe face of the resistance. Martyred while fighting for our liberation. Rest in powerâ alongside an inverted red triangle.

The SJP chapter at California State University, Northridge, reposted a video of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (Hamasâs military wing) spokesperson Abu Obaidaâs speech from a few days earlier, on the anniversary of October 7, speaking about how assassinations will not deter Hamas. The SJP at California State University, Long Beach, reposted a well-known photograph of Sinwar taken amid the 2021 escalation between Israel and Hamas, showing him sitting in an armchair in Gaza with the ruins of his former house in the background, and added a burning heart emoji over the image.

Multiple Columbia University student groups, including SJP and Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), posted about Sinwar, including sharing a digital copy of his book and posting various quotations and video clips of him outlining Hamasâs decision âto defend our people with whatever weapons we have.â Wellesley SJP also made a series of Sinwar-related posts, including sharing photographs, interview content and messages declaring, âNo matter how many leaders they take, new ones will rise; The resistance will never die.â

Community Groups and Other Activists

Numerous other anti-Israel groups shared similar praise for Sinwar. New York-based extreme anti-Zionist group Within Our Lifetime (WOL) published an obituary for the Hamas leader that was further shared by many community and campus groups. The WOL statement praised Sinwar as âa fierce leader who did not waver, but advanced the struggle until his very last breathâ and who âwas a key figure who united the fields against zionism [sic].â The statement declared that Sinwarâs âlegacy will live on in the hearts of every revolutionaryâ and that âthese enduring ideas, deeply rooted in the people of Palestine, will drive the struggle forward until the zionist [sic] entity is dismantled.â

Â 

Another NY-based anti-Zionist group, PAL-Awda NY/NJ (a merger of the Palestinian Assembly for Liberation and Al-Awda NY/NJ), also shared a statement in honor of the âmartyrdomâ of Sinwar, declaring that he âlived a hero and died a legendâ and that his âname will go down in history as a symbol of resistance and liberation.â It characterized his death as marking both a âmoment of mourningâ and âa moment to recognize the dismantling tentacles of the zionist [sic] entity,â adding that, âthe legacy of Yahya Sinwar is a powerful testament to resilience and resistance, destined to birth millions of Sinwars.â

Individual activists and influencers also weighed in with praise for Sinwar. Daniel Haqiqatjou, an antisemitic conspiracy theorist who founded the online publication Muslim Skeptic, shared the popular photograph of Sinwar holding a pistol and wrote: âWhen Sinwar accepted leadership, he accepted inevitable martyrdom. O Muslims, that is the necessary quality any leader worth following must have.â Jackson Hinkle, a far-right commentator and influencer who posts extensive antisemitic and anti-Israel content, posted a photograph of Sinwar on X and wrote: âYahya Sinwar put death before dishonorâ alongside broken heart and Palestinian flag emojis.

Anti-Zionist Rutgers University professor Noura Erakat shared several posts on X and Instagram lionizing Sinwar, including one calling him an âimmortal legend.â Ali Abunimah, co-founder and executive director of the anti-Zionist publication Electronic Intifada, wrote on X: âSinwar died as he would wish, fighting honorably with and for his people, against the evils of Zionism, colonialism and genocide.â He added in another post: âSinwar already defeated âIsraelâ on 7 October, destroying forever its myth of invincibility, and changing history. He set Palestine on the road to liberation from the evil of Zionism and generations yet unborn will thank him.â

On-the-Ground Activities

In addition to the countless posts memorializing Sinwar online after his death, anti-Israel protesters and vandals also marked Sinwarâs passing with offline actions. At an anti-Israel protest in New York City on October 18, for example, multiple protesters held up photographs of Sinwar.

On the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, graffiti was reportedly drawn on multiple wayfinding signs with the message âSINWAR LIVESâ alongside an inverted triangle. At least one instance of this graffiti was reportedly in close proximity to the campus Hillel building.Â

Â 

These recent manifestations of pro-Sinwar sentiment were unsurprising, as even before his death, Sinwar was often honored by anti-Israel protesters. For example, at two Nakba Day protests in New York earlier in the year â in Queens on May 15 and in Brooklyn on May 18 â protestersÂ carried a Samidoun-branded banner featuring an image of Sinwar alongside depictions of Mohammed Deif (Al-Qassam Brigades leader) and Abu Obaida (Al-Qassam Brigades spokesperson). At an anti-Israel protest at Hunter College in New York on June 21, a protester carried a photograph of Sinwar.

Pattern of Pro-Terror Behavior

The veneration of Sinwar follows a predictable pattern of disturbing activity from significant portions of the U.S. anti-Israel movement that have made explicit support for terror a defining characteristic of their activism over the past year. While glorifying individual terrorists â like PFLP-affiliated Leila Khaled, Ahmad Saâadat and Walid Daqqa â is a regular feature of online and on-the-ground anti-Israel demonstrations, the past few months have seen particularly egregious examples of this following the deaths of some of the most prominent terror group leaders in Hamasâs Haniyeh and Hezbollahâs Nasrallah.

Following Haniyehâs Death

After Haniyehâs death in Iran on July 31, anti-Israel activists quickly memorialized him online. Among student groups, the UCSD Divest Coalition at the University of California, San Diego, shared a post âcommemorating the martyrdomâ of Haniyeh. The post was originally shared by Masar Badil (also known as the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement), an extreme anti-Zionist international organization that hosts programs with members of U.S.-designated terror organizations and whose leadership includes PFLP and Samidoun-linked Khaled Barakat.

The International Committee of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) published â and later deleted â a statement in support of Haniyeh that read, in part: âWe mourn and honor the martyrs of Lebanon and Palestine and express our unwavering solidarity with their popular resistance movementsâ¦The contributions of these figures to the cause of freedom and justice will not be forgotten and their victories will not be reversed.â

Zahra Billoo, Executive Director of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), wrote on Instagram and X: âTonight, we mourn Ismail himself but know his martyrdom is not in vain. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.â Lamis Deek, an anti-Zionist attorney and leader with the organization Al-Awda wrote on X: âIf only the western [sic] world knew him as we and all who dealt with him did. He was love and humility and sacrifice incarnate....too good for this world.â

Â 

PAL-Awda NY/NJ also memorialized Haniyeh in a statement on social media: âAll glory to the martyrs of Palestinian liberation and return! We salute the resistance, their leadership, and unwavering resilience which has shown no peace for the Zionist aggressors.â

PAL-Awda NY/NJ also hosted a vigil to honor Haniyeh on July 31 in Brooklyn, NY, alongside representatives from groups including Neturei Karta, Bay Ridge Solidarity and Mamas 4 A Free Palestine. At the demonstration, protesters held illustrations of Haniyeh and shared remarks honoring him, with one speaker stating: âItâs either victory or martyrdomâ¦We salute and honor the Axis of Resistance as the vanguard of the movement for Palestinian liberation. We welcome whatever path it chooses to dismantle the Zionist State.

Â 

Protesters displaying imagery or photographs of terrorists â both dead and living â has become commonplace at protests, and in New York City in particular. At another NYC protest that same day sponsored by WOL in Times Square, a protester held up photographs of Haniyeh and Nasrallah.

Following Nasrallahâs Death

When Nasrallah was killed in Lebanon on September 27, another wave of memorialization and glorification followed.

Within Our Lifetime (WOL) published a statement on Telegram, mourning âthe martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Lebanese resistance and a symbol of the steadfast struggle to liberate Palestine.â The statement further read: âEven after [Nasrallahâs] martyrdom, his ideas and legacy will remain a beacon of hope for thousands to honor after him.â Other groups, including the SJP chapter at St. Johnâs University in Queens, NY, shared the WOL statement on their own social media pages.

Student groups at Stony Brook University in New York, including Stony Brook SJP (also known as Stony Brook for Palestine) and Graduate Students for Palestine, posted a joint statement on Instagram on September 28 titled, âIN SOLIDARITY WITH LEBANON AGAINST ZIONIST-FASCIST BRUTALITY.â In the statement, the groups commemorated Nasrallah as âa beacon of light in resistance efforts against the Zionist entityâ and praised how, âunder his leadership, Hezbollah has risen to prominence as a major threat to âisraelâsâ [sic] occupation of Palestine.â

Â 

The Stony Brook SJP statement concluded by affirming: âAs we have supported the Palestinians in their resistance against the Amerikkkan-backed Zionist entity, SB4Palestine affirms the same support for the people of Lebanon in their fight. We honor the martyrs and stand with the resistance against the imperialist regimes of âisraelâ and Amerikkka.ââ

The Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a NY-based anti-Israel group, also published a statement on its website mourning Nasrallah: âThe path of resistance is arduous but paved with sacrifices, like Nasrallah's, for justice and liberation. His martyrdom stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of resistanceâ¦While we feel the pain of losing a prominent figure, we take pride in his legacy.â

Anti-Israel protesters displayed messages honoring both Nasrallah and Haniyeh at some of the October 5â6 nationwide âDay of Actionâ protests to mark the first anniversary of Hamasâs October 7, 2023, attack. In Washington, DC, on October 5, a protester displayed a sign depicting Haniyeh and Nasrallah alongside the caption: âKilling our leaders only makes us stronger.â

In Houston, TX, on October 5, a protester held a sign that read: âResistance is necessary. Peace be upon Sayyed Hassan [Nasrallah] & Ismail Haniyeh.â In Minneapolis, MN, on October 6, a protester displayed a sign featuring photographs of Nasrallah and the message: âRest in Power Hassan Nasrallah!â A Seattle, WA, protest on October 13, also featured multiple explicit pro-terror signs, including one that read, âGlory to the Martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,â alongside a photograph of Nasrallah.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-death-arch-terrorist-yahya-sinwar-truly-justice-served,"New York, NY, October 17, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the death of Hamas arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar at the hands of an Israel Defense Forces patrol in Gaza. Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

The reported death of arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar at the hands of an ordinary IDF patrol truly is justice served.

As we have seen with the killing of Bin Laden, Baghdadi, Nasrallah, and other evil terrorist masterminds, this is a stark reminder that terror does not pay, and hate does not win.

Indeed, Sinwar was covered in blood. His legacy is little more than death and despair. This outcome is an accomplishment that all people of good faith objectively should embrace.

However, in the hours and days ahead, it seems predictable that anti-Israel zealots, radical anti-Zionists, and hateful antisemites will lionize him. Moreover, if the recent killing of Nasrallah was any kind of foreshadowing, many in the mainstream media will launder his homicidal history and whitewash his evil, genocidal agenda. I will leave it to others to detail his history of murder and terror.

But we cannot turn the page and certainly should not celebrate.

This does not end until all the remaining hostages are returned, including American citizens. These are people whose families and friends were butchered on 10/7. Since that day, they have endured over a year of unimaginable brutality and suffering in Hamas captivity. #BringThemHomeNow.

We also cannot celebrate because there are too many innocents to mourn, too many who have suffered in this war. This starts with the thousands of individuals who were attacked, brutalized, raped, tortured and the 1,200 who were slaughtered on 10/7. It happened to them in their homes, in their cars, at bus stops, at a music festival, in bomb shelters, or in other places. This includes all the Israelis killed in the wave of terror that followed since 10/7, such as the 12 Druze children murdered in cold blood this past summer on a soccer field in Majdal Shams. This also includes the thousands of Palestinian civilians killed in the fighting in Gaza and Lebanon, particularly those who lost their lives because they served as human shields for Hamas and Hezbollah, grotesque organizations that hid their fighters, supplies and weapons in their homes, hospitals, and schools.

We cannot celebrate because there are too many in America, Europe and around the world who seem prepared to carry on Sinwarâs legacy and to continue theÂ campaign of confrontation and hate that has embroiled our campuses, engulfed our communities, in a tsunami of antisemitism and hate.Â  Those who wave Hamas and Hezbollah flags, praising terror organizations with American blood on their hands. Those who intimidate and threaten Jewish people, bullying our children,Â boycotting our businesses, vandalizing our synagogues, and maligning our community. We need a zero-tolerance policy on intolerance whether on campuses, in politics, or anywhere. Leaders need to lead and stop this in its tracks.

Finally, we cannot celebrate and truly move forward until there is a plan implemented to push Hezbollah out of Southern Lebanon and an agreed upon plan to rebuild Gaza in a demilitarized manner with a government actually ready to serve the needs of its people and prepared to make peace with Israel. This will require effort on the part of Israel, America, Europe, the Arab countries and perhaps the whole world. But when that happens, that will be the moment when we finally will see a Free Gaza -- free from Hamas, free from hate, free from terror, free for all.

That will be a moment to celebrate.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-welcomes-decision-us-treasury-sanction-samidoun-palestinian-prisoner,"New York, NY, October 15, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the decision by the U.S. Department of the Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control, in a joint action with Canada, officially designating the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, or âSamidoun,â as a sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

âWe applaud the decision by the U.S. Treasury DepartmentÂ to sanction the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network. This is an organization that has openly praised the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel and encourages engagement with a radical antisemitic, anti-Zionist social media channel that regularly features pro-Hamas propaganda and violent anti-Israel imagery. This organization should not have the ability to raise funds for terrorism in the United States or in any democracy.

âTodayâs action by Treasury will help to ensure that funds raised through the illicit activities of this sham organization do not reach the hands of terrorists overseas. This action also should serve as a challenge to other anti-Israel groups who collaborate with Samidoun. This is a moment of truth for them to decide whether they will continue to partner with a sham charity that is a front for FPLP fundraising.

âWe deeply appreciate the governments of the U.S. and Canada for taking action and continuing to seek ways to disrupt the flow of finances to the PFLP, Hamas and other terrorist organizations.â


On multiple occasions ADL has shared intelligence about Samidounâs activities with Congress and the Administration, and encouraged the government to take action against them. Samidoun chapters in the U.S., Canada and other Western countries campaign on behalf of Palestinians imprisoned in those nations, including those arrested or convicted for alleged involvement in terror activity or âdirect actions"" for Palestinians, according to the ADL Center on Extremism. The group has been explicit in their support for those convicted and accused of acts related to terrorism.

In July, Oren Segal, Vice President of the ADL Center on Extremism, testified before the Ways and Means Committee and ADL briefed the administration about Samidoun, its rhetorical support for terror, and overlap with PFLP networks and propaganda.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/extremists-co-opt-hurricane-response-blame-israel-incite-storm-hateful-narratives,"Right-wing extremists have been exploiting the devastation surrounding Hurricane Helene â a storm that has so far claimed the lives of at least 230 people in the southeast U.S. â and now Hurricane Milton, to advance antisemitic or anti-Israel conspiracy theories that federal disaster assistance has been slow or inadequate because they believe the U.S. is sending funds and personnel to Israel instead.

Extremist groups have a history of participating in disaster relief efforts to garner positive attention, push conspiracy theories and potentially recruit new followers. These types of conspiracy theories areÂ dangerous as they can lead to violence, put relief workers at risk and undercut public faith in civil society.

In late September and early October, the white supremacist group Patriot FrontÂ traveled to North Carolina and Florida purportedly to help clear debris from the storm. Patriot Front posted about the groupâs efforts, claiming that the U.S. government is âmore interested in the concerns of Israel than they are of the Appalachian people,â while their assistance represented a true âAmerica Firstâ initiative.Â 

Other extremists have alleged that due to the U.S.âs focus on Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza, the military has been unable to adequately assist with needed disaster relief. On October 3, 2024, The Western Chauvinist, a white supremacist Proud Boys offshoot channel, posted on Telegram, âThe occupied US government has sent all the young people in the military that could've helped to Israel. It isn't the government that has responded, but Nationalists like Patriot Front who answer the call.""

In early October, a white supremacist X/Twitter account, â1488 Radio,â hosted a pro-white Twitter space event with 10,300 listeners. During the stream, an individual who claimed to be a Hurricane survivor blamed the war in Gaza for inadequate emergency aid, ""Our state government and federal government are nowhere to be found...They [the military] are being stood up to go to goddamn Israel."" This Twitter spaceâs sound bites have since been shared across a range of white supremacist online accounts and channels.

Â 

Extremist groups have also targeted FEMA employees and government officials who are Jewish or whom they believe to be Jewish with antisemitic harassment and vitriol. On October 8, Michael Weaver, a self-described âspokespersonâ for the antisemitic Goyim Defense League (GDL)Â posted a new flier for the network on Gab, which claims, âEvery Single Aspect of FEMA is Jewish.â A few days earlier, Leslie Boyanton, a live streamer with the antisemitic GDL, promoted an episode of his âBen Tanklin Showâ called âFuck FEMA Friday,â which was accompanied by the image of the FEMA Director of Public Affairs, Jacklyn Rothenberg, alongside an Israeli flag.Â

Â 

Other extremists and prominent conspiracy theorists have used Hurricane Helene to elevate longstanding antisemitic tropes, including that Jews have outsized control or influence over the media and government. For example, Red Ice TV, a white supremacist website and video streaming platform, alleged in late September that âIsraeli issuesâ are getting more mainstream media attention than Hurricane Helene. On October 4, 2024,Â Andrew Torba, founder and CEO of alternative social media platform Gab, posted on X that Jewish government officials are using American tax dollars to fund âIsraeli bombsâ instead of using them towards hurricane victim relief.

Stew Peters, a far-right conspiracy theorist and prolific antisemite, recently promoted the conspiracy theory that Jews are manipulating hurricanes to ""destroyâ the United States. In an October 9, 2024, segment of the âStew Peters Showâ on Hurricane Helene, Peters claimed that the Jewish community has advanced âtechnologyâ to âweaponize weatherâ and is extending their âoctopus tentaclesâ into American society, broadcasting aÂ cartoon from the late 1800s that reflects the classic antisemitic tropeÂ portraying Jews as tentacled monsters.Â 

Anti-Israel and antisemitic narratives surrounding Helene and Milton are also rife in anti-Zionist spaces, where posters claim that the U.S. government is withholding FEMA relief in favor of providing arms and other aid to Israel.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/united-nations-relief-and-works-agency-palestinian-refugees-unrwa,"Background:

For decades, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has been criticized for institutionalizing the Palestinian refugee crisis, the problematic anti-Israel and antisemitic content taught in its schools, the terrorist affiliations of some of its staff, and for its complicity with terrorist activities - including the use of its premises by terrorist groups. As a UN entity, UNRWA is obligated to uphold neutrality which includes ensuring that terrorists are neither employed by the agency, nor present on its premises.

Founded in 1949, UNWRA was established to provide relief and programs for Palestinian refugees after Israelâs 1948 War of Independence.Â UNRWA classifies Palestinian refugees as those who left Israel in 1948; those who left the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967; those who were abroad but were subsequently not allowed to return to Israel; and all of their descendants. Refugee status is granted regardless of whether descendants have been resettled or obtained legal residency/nationality in another country. According to UNWRA, this totals five million Palestinian refugees, while the original estimated Palestinian refugee count was 750,000. UNRWAâs policy of including the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who left in 1948 and 1967 into the refugee population for demographic and aid purposes is unique among refugee populations, and is not a done for any other refugee group.

Israel believes the UNRWA statistics are exaggerated and further distinguishes ârefugeesâ from âdisplaced personsâ and from âexpired permit Palestiniansâ who were abroad at the time the conflicts ensued and were not allowed to return.

UNRWA is the only UN body that works specifically with one refugee population â Palestinians - while the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has a global mandate and works with every other refugee population. UNWRA is almost entirely funded by UN Member States with some funding coming from tax exempt foundations such as UNRWA USA National Committee, and the General Assembly has renewed its mandate every three years consecutively (most recently until June 30, 2026).

Around 30,000 people are employed by UNRWA around the Middle East, thousands of whom work in its schools. According to Israeli intelligence, before October 7thÂ  2023, over 450 active members of Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations were employed by UNRWA in Gaza. Additionally, in July 2024, evidence uncovered by the IDF found that at least 75 of the 510 employees in UNRWA's education system in the Gaza Strip who hold senior positions (school principals and their deputies, directors and deputy directors of training centers) are members of Hamas or the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.â The IDF provided details, including ID numbers, UNRWA schools of employment, organizational affiliations and positions, of 12 of such individuals to the public.

Involvement in the October 7 massacre:

Following the October 7, 2023 massacres in Israel perpetrated by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the IDF uncovered evidence that several UNRWA employees participated in the killing, kidnapping and brutalizing of civilians in Israel. A video of two UNRWA employees loading the body of Yonatan Samerano, a 21-year-old Israeli murdered on October 7, into a truck heading for Gaza was circulated widely online.

In January of 2024, Israeli authorities presented UNRWA with allegations that 19 of its employees based in Gaza had been involved in the October 7 attacks. Subsequently, Commissioner General of UNRWA Philippe Lazzarini stated that the contracts of implicated staff members were terminated and that an investigation was underway. In response to the allegations, several countries including the US and European Union paused or suspended funding to UNRWA.

Despite the IDF allegations, the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) investigationÂ  concluded that only 9 of the 19 implicated UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7thÂ  attack. UNRWA has maintained that the issue of neutrality breaches has been resolved through the investigation and is a case of âa few bad apples.â

UNRWA facilities used as terror infrastructure:

Hamas and other terror organizations have long used UNRWA infrastructure across Gaza to house their military operations, including using them as a base of operation, to fire mortars at Israel and to provide access doors to terror tunnels underneath. As early as 2009, Hamas terrorists were found in UNRWA schools by the IDF. In 2014, there were multiple instances of terrorists firing from UNRWA schools, as well as rockets found stored in an UNRWA school.

Throughout its time in Gaza following October 7, the IDF found over thirty UNRWA facilities, including schools in Gaza containing terror infrastructure. On several occasions such facilities have been used to fire rockets at Israeli civilian areas. Beneath the UNRWA Headquarters in Gaza, the IDF discovered a Hamas subterranean data center which included computer rooms, servers, living quarters, and industrial power banks used to conduct Hamas terror activities.

Seized records from Hamasâ Qassam Brigades (Hamasâ military wing) show that to Hamas, schools and civilian facilities serve as âthe best obstacles to protect the resistance.â

UNRWA Education and Terrorism:

For decades, there has been deep concern about anti-Israel and antisemitic content taught in UNRWA schools (at which 545,000 students are enrolled), both in the official curricular materials and in lessons by individual teachers. UNRWA claims to review all teaching materials taught in its schools to assure appropriate content and UNESCO standards, as well as to supplement host country materials. According to IMPACT-se, an organization that analyzes teaching materials around the world, in the Palestinian territories, UNESCO schools use the Palestinian Authority curriculum which, though revised in 2016, continues to contain antisemitic and Jihadist incitement content, sometimes more severe than previous iterations.

In 2021, IMPACT-se reviewed educational materials distributed during the COVID-19 pandemic for distance learning at UNRWA schools. Incitement to violence, hatred, and glorification of terrorism was found in the textbooks. For example, students were told to do mathematics problems using martyred terrorists from the First Intifada to calculate equations and told to âdefend the motherland with blood.â Following the release of IMPACT-se's 2021 review, UNRWA Chief Lazzarini stated that the hateful materials were published by accident and replaced.

The November 2024 report by IMPACT-se details textbooks and teaching materials from five UNRWA schools run by senior Hamas leaders in Gaza, and again found glorification of terrorism, anti-Israel and antisemitic content in its educational materials.

Some educators at UNRWA schools have been discovered to be terrorists. Fateh al-Sharif, an UNRWA Principal and Teachers' Union leader, was confirmed by Hamas to be their commander in Lebanon after he was killed by an Israeli strike in September 2024. While principal of an UNRWA school, Al-Sharif repeatedly posted images of students dressed in Hamas uniforms and holding guns, as well as images of himself with Hamas members, pictured in images found by UN Watch on Al-Sharif's Facebook profile. Al-Sharif was repeatedly seen inviting other Hamas terror leaders to his UNRWA school. In March 2024, Fateh al-Sharif was suspended by UNRWA for breaches of neutrality which led to widespread protests and strikes at UNRWA schools for his reinstatement.

In several cases, after Israel provided evidence and warned that UNRWA educators were militants in terror organizations, they remained employed by the organization.

UNRWA Leadership Meet with Terrorists:

UN Watch discovered that in 2017, Pierre KrÃ¤henbÃ¼hl, Commissioner General of UNRWA at the time and current Director-General of the ICRC,Â met with Hamas and PIJ leaders to discuss the âspirit of partnershipâ between the UN agency and the terrorist groups, telling them: âWe are united, no one can separate us.â

According to findings by UN Watch, the practice of UNRWA chiefs meeting with terrorists has been ongoing, including with current UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini. He met with officials from the Palestinian Joint Action Committee, a coalition of Palestinian armed groups in Lebanon, in March 2021. During the meeting, which included a discussion of UNRWAâs cash assistance to refugees, Lazzarini spoke with Hajj Abu Suleiman Al-Saadi, an Asbat al-Ansar terrorist, and Sheikh of the Palestinian Jihadi Movement, Jamal Khattab, among others. The Palestinian Joint Action Committee is headed by leaders from each domestic branch of the armed groups including DFLP, Hamas, Palestinian Jihad, and Asbat al-Ansar.

Additionally, in 2004, then Commissioner General of UNRWA Peter Hansen was quoted saying ""I am sure there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll. And I don't see that as a crime,"" during an interview with CBC News.

Israeli Reactions to UNRWA Activities:

Israel has repeatedly shared with UNRWA leadership and the UN Secretary General its information on UNRWAâs entanglement with terrorists by way of official letters and complaints against the organization, to little effect.

On October 28, 2024, Israelâs parliament voted to ban UNRWA operations in Israel and significantly restrict its abilities to operate in Gaza and the West Bank, due to the links between UNRWA and terrorist organizations. The decision was highly controversial and drew condemnation from several governments who do not see an alternative to UNRWA for providing Palestinians aid and education. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâs office, Israel will work with other aid organizations to ensure delivery of aid to Gazan civilians.

After passing the legislation, Israel briefed diplomats from countries that fund UNRWA on the documents of evidence it has compiled proving the organizationâs ties to terrorist factions. Gazan residents themselves have said in interviews that it is widely known that Hamas has operatives in UNRWA schools, as reported by the New York Times.

International Legal Reactions:

The mounting evidence against UNRWA for its severe breaches of neutrality and complicity with terrorism have led to international legal actions against the UN agency, as well as governmental suspension of funds.

In January 2024, the United States Congress froze funding for UNRWA until at least March 2025 following the allegations of staff membership in terror organizations, and in December 2024 Sweden completely halted funding for UNRWA for 2025 while nearly doubling its funding for other aid organizations. Also in December 2024, the Dutch Parliament voted to gradually phase out funding for the agency until 2029, when only 1 million Euros will be granted.

Several lawsuits have been filed against UNRWA by October 7th survivors and families of victims, one of which was filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan by about 100 Israeli plaintiffs alleging that UNWA âaided and abettedâ Hamas by providing $1 billion in aid to Gaza which was diverted to Hamas to support its terror activities and infrastructure.

UNRWA USA is being sued by the National Jewish Advocacy Center, Inc. (NJAC), on behalf of ten Plaintiffs in US federal court claiming that UNRWA USA aided and abetted terrorism through its monetary support of UNRWA. The Plaintiffs argue that UNRWA USA violated the Anti-Terrorism Act, as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, by aiding and abetting and knowingly providing support and resources to UNRWA and Hamas, who they claim jointly carry out terrorist activities.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/intimidation-harassment-and-support-hamas-mark-widespread-anti-israel-student,"On the grim anniversary of Hamasâs October 7, 2023 terror massacre in southern Israel, when thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages, anti-Israel student group demonstrations on U.S. campuses again featured extreme pro-terror messages that glorified the attack and sought to disrupt campus life. Some events were marked by vandalism, intimidation and harassment.

On a day when Jewish people around the world were mourning the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, Jewish students and community members were repeatedly confronted with rhetoric that celebrated that violence on the ground and online.

The dayâs actions were part of a campus-focused âWeek of Rageâ endorsed by the national leadership of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and other prominent anti-Zionist groups ahead of the October 7 anniversary. Mondayâs actions also followed widespread off-campus anniversary protests organized by many of those same groups during an âInternational Day of Actionâ over the weekend of October 5â6, which was also characterized by significant support for terror.

Student groups on over 100 U.S. campuses sponsored activities on October 7, 2024. At many of these events, protestersâ signs, clothing, flags, chants and speaker comments explicitly venerated Hamasâs deadly attack. For example, many referred to the terror assault using Hamasâs name for it â the âAl Aqsa Floodâ â or by characterizing it as a laudable act of liberation or âbreaking out of prison.â Other examples included displaying paraglider imagery, a direct reference to Hamasâs use of paragliders to invade southern Israeli communities on October 7, or inverted red triangle imagery, a symbol popularized by Hamas over the past year to mark targets.

At the University of Illinois Chicago, students walked out of classes at noon and gathered to âtake over the quadâ on campus. A speaker representing the Chicago chapter of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) read from a statement published by the group to celebrate the anniversary of Hamasâs attack: âOn October 7, the sound of freedom thundered across Palestine, and its echoes are still being heard around the world. The Palestinian resistance launched Operation Al Aqsa Flood, a mass breakout from the worldâs largest open air prison, Gaza. And, in doing so, they took a historic step towards liberation.â

In Philadelphia, anti-Israel protesters from throughout the region gathered at Drexel University for a protest that featured numerous extreme displays of support for terror. This included a banner carried by members of the local FRSO chapter that read, âVictory to the Palestinian Resistance,â alongside gun and paraglider imagery.

Protesters in Philadelphia also flew a flag bearing the logo of the U.S.-designated terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and a flag with an image of Abu Obaida, the spokesperson for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (Hamasâs military wing). Obaida and the Al-Qassam Brigades were also referenced in multiple chants at the protest that called for violence against Israel: âAbu Obaida, love: strike, strike, Tel Avivâ (translated from Arabic) and âAl-Qassam, make us proud; take another soldier now.â

The Philadelphia protest was co-sponsored or endorsed by SJP chapters and other anti-Israel student groups from many local schools, including host Drexel University, Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, Swarthmore College, Temple University, the University of Pennsylvania and Villanova University. Corresponding chapters of Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine (FSJP) from those schools also endorsed the protest.

New York City also saw significant activity, with student groups holding protests at colleges throughout the city and later converging for a joint off-campus rally and march in conjunction with the pro-terror anti-Israel group, Within Our Lifetime (WOL). At Columbia University, protesters carried signs that included an image of Abu Obaida alongside the slogan âZionismâs end daysâ and inverted red triangle imagery. Another sign depicted Obaida with the message âLong Live the Al-Aqsa Flood; Glory to the Resistanceâ alongside paraglider and inverted red triangle imagery.

A speaker praised âthe heroic acts by the Palestinian Resistance and its allies in the regionâ and commented that âPalestinian Resistance remains our guiding light.âÂ Students also chanted, âResistance is glorious, we will be victorious,â effectively exalting Hamasâs actions on October 7.

Â 

Student protesters from more than a dozen New York-area schools merged with the off-campus WOL-led protest later in the afternoon that made its way through Lower and Midtown Manhattan. The large march drew thousands of participants and featured significant support for terror in the form of Hamas and Hezbollah flags, signs like the Samidoun-branded âLong Live October 7thâ banner also seen at previous NYC protests, and more. Nerdeen Kiswani, a former student activist who leads WOL, shared support for October 7 during her speech and denied reports of Israeli suffering, including accounts from Israeli women who were raped by terrorists during the attack.

At Tulane University in New Orleans, LA, protesters carried signs with messages that included âLong Live Resistanceâ â in which the two Ls were represented with images of guns â alongside paraglider and inverted red triangle imagery. Slogans and imagery seen at the DePaul University student walkout in Chicago, IL, included a sign with an illustration of notorious PFLP terrorist Leila Khaled alongside the slogan âBy any means necessary,â as well as a banner with the message, âIt didnât start on October 7th.â

Some protests escalated into the direct harassment of students and other campus community members. At the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, anti-Israel protesters gathered directly outside of the Minnesota Hillel building while Jewish community members were inside to mourn the October 7 attack; Hillels nationwide have increasingly been the target of anti-Israel protests and activism in the past year.

At Pomona College in California, anti-Israel student protesters from across the Claremont Colleges rallied after walking out of class and then stormed into the Carnegie Hall academic building on campus. The protestersâ actions disrupted classes taking place inside the building and forced students in those classrooms to climb out of windows to leave since they were blocking the doors.

The protesters occupied the building for several hours. While inside, they vandalized the building with graffiti that included the spray-painted messages, âINTIFADAâ and âFUCK POMONA.â The action was reminiscent of the destructive escalation tactics employed by anti-Israel student groups on various campuses during the encampment movement in the spring semester of 2024. Later in the day, university officials reported âextensive damageâ in Carnegie Hall and announced that the building âwill remain closed until further notice, and classes will be relocated.â

Instances of vandalism were reported on numerous other campuses on Monday. At Chapman University in Orange, CA, for example, images of burning Israeli flags were painted on the ground, along with the slogans âF Israel,â âDeath to Israelâ and âDeath to America.â The graffiti also featured a threatening message directed at the schoolâs pro-Israel student group, Students Supporting Israel (SSI), with an inverted red triangle drawn over the text âSSI.â Vandalism incidents also took place Monday at Cal Poly Humboldt, City College of New York, Princeton University, the University of South Florida, the University of Virginia and other schools.

In addition to the on-the-ground activities of anti-Israel protesters on campuses throughout the day, on social media, many student groups also celebrated the anniversary of Hamasâs October 7 attack and affirmed their support for terrorism more broadly. Posts from dozens of groups framed terrorism as praiseworthy âresistanceâ and terrorists as heroic âfreedom fighters.â Many posts featured photographs and related imagery taken directly from the October 7 attack.

Â 

Students Allied for Freedom and Equality (SAFE) at the University of Michigan, for example, published a statement across social media platforms that read: âThe October 7th mobilization lives on as a historic act of resistance against the Zionist colonial project. We remain in complete, unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian people and their dignified resistance forces. Glory to our martyrs and power to our freedom fighters. May they continue to be victorious over their oppressors.â

Georgia State University SJP posted: âToday we extend our solidarity and unconditional support to the people of Palestine and Lebanon, their brave resistance fighters, and their martyrs.â New Brunswick SJP, which remains active at Rutgers University despite the recent suspension of its status as an officially recognized student group due to campus policy violations, published a statement that opened by commemorating Hamasâs attack: âA year ago today, on October 7th, the Palestinian resistance launched the Al-Aqsa Flood offensive strategy to break out of the 17-year-long open-air prison of the blockaded Gaza Strip.â

Case Western Reserve University SJP and LSJP (Law Students for Justice in Palestine) wrote in a joint statement: âThe only tragedy that October 7th commemorates is the start of another genocide against the Palestinian people.â Swarthmore SJP posted, âHappy October 7th!â on Instagram and solicited donations for a fundraiser âin honor of this glorious day and all our martyred revolutionaries.â

University of California, Davis SJP shared Hamas propaganda featuring Abu Obaida, while the University of California, Berkeley YDSA shared PFLP propaganda. The student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest posted a series of photographs celebrating violence against Israelis, including images from October 7 as well as the Ramallah lynching of two Israeli military reservists in 2000 during the Second Intifada.

Numerous other student groups shared similar posts supportive of terror groups, figures, or propaganda across social media platforms.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

There are no Starbucks in Israel.

Yet, over the past year since the horrific attacks of October 7th in which Hamas terrorists butchered 1,200 innocent men, women, and children, Starbucks locations all over the US â and the world â have been vandalized with anti-Israel graffiti. Calls to boycott Starbucks have been spray-painted on stores and spread online. The situation grew so serious that the companyâs CEO addressed the situation in the company end-of-year letter to shareholders.

Ironically, Starbucks does have locations in Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and throughout the Persian Gulf, serving exponentially more Muslims than Jews.

In light of all the death and destruction these past 365 days and the 101 hostages still held in captivity in Gaza, the plight of a multinational, billion-dollar coffee chain might seem trivial.

Yet what happened to Starbucks is emblematic of the stakes of the conflict the Jewish community has found itself in since 10/7. Antisemitism has erupted across the US and globally. While some may see this strictly as a problem for the Jewish community, that is willfully myopic. Antisemitism is not just the oldest hatred, but a symptom of deep dysfunction below the surface of liberal democratic societies and a threat to the pluralism that makes these countries work.

In the years leading up to 10/7, antisemitism already had reached record heights. Since then, it has exploded. Antisemitic incidents increased 140 percent from 2022 to 2023, breaking all previous records. According to the most recent FBI hate crimes report, anti-Jewish hate crimes rose 63 percent to 1,832 incidents in 2023, the highest number ever recorded since the Bureau began collecting data in 1991.

Driving this surge is a concomitant increase in antisemitic attitudes. For nearly 30 years, ADL found that the percentage of Americans with intense antisemitic attitudes hovered at around 10 percent. In 2022, that jumped to 20 percent. And in 2024, it jumped to 24 percent â the highest level ADL has seen in six decades.

Surging antisemitism impacts Jewish Americans in many ways: the armed guards protecting every synagogue in America; the observant Jew who makes sure to cover his kippah with a baseball cap when out in public; the college student who hides her connection to the Jewish homeland in order to join a club or just get through the day without being harassed; the Jewish professionals â authors, investors, therapists, small business owners â targeted as âZionistsâ and subsequently bullied by activists, shunned by confused clients and ignored by terrified customers.

But the broader world canât afford the pipe dream that this disease can be contained. While the Jewish community certainly bears the brunt of antisemitism, it is a contagion. It ultimately will infect â and endanger â all of American society.

There are many reasons for its unprecedented spread. Despite rising standards of living, tectonic changes in the economy and society have generated widespread anxiety and massive uncertainty. Social media has played a part by reinforcing the sense that there is no empirical truth and any outlandish plot is possible. All of this creates a ripe environment for conspiracy thinking and scapegoating on all sides.

On the extreme right, this most prominently has taken the form of the âGreat Replacementâ theory, a conspiracy that posits that a cabal of Jews is opening the borders of the United States to let in non-white minorities to replace âreal Americans.â This is why the tiki-torch marchers at Charlottesville in 2017 chanted âJews will not replace us.â This is how the gunman who gunned down 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018 justified the massacre. And this is what is spouted with increasing frequency by far-right personalities such as Nick Fuentes, Candace Owens, and Tucker Carlson.

For this group, toxic antisemitism is core to their ideology. As political theorist Eric Ward has written, their virulent white nationalism and its anti-immigrant, anti-Black, and anti-Muslim views emanate from their conspiratorial hatred of Jews.

Radicals on the left start with a very different set of coordinates but somehow manage to land at the same destination. This doesnât mean that every protestor who has taken to the streets since 10/7 is motivated by hate. Many are inspired by genuine concern regarding the civilian death toll in Gaza.

Nonetheless, it is increasingly clear that the dominant current propelling many of these protests is not enlightened universalism, but raw desire to eliminate the only Jewish country in the entire world â home to nearly half of the Jews worldwide. It is a radical ideology focused, not on ending the conflict or even achieving peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, but simply on destroying the Jewish state.

As this single-minded obsession with exterminating Israel has taken hold among the ranks of the activists, there has been an unmistakable embrace of conspiratorial views â for example, that Jews are part of an âoppressorâ class responsible for the ills of the Middle East and of the United States and that Jews have undue amounts of power over universities and of the government. Like those on the right, such a worldview is impervious to facts and often leads to anarchic violence and rage against Jews, Israel, and increasingly America itself.

Numerous examples illustrate this point. To name a few, last May, activists broke into the Presidentâs office at Stanford and poured red paint on his desk. At the same time, others defaced the universityâs Main Quad with messages like âDe@th 2 Isr@hell,â âPigs taste best dead,â and âF*** Amerikkka.â

When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington DC this past summer to deliver remarks before Congress, activists agitated across the city. In front of historic Union Station, they vandalized statues with phrases like âHamas is coming!â Others burned Israeli and American flags.

This past September at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, protesters entered the historic Navy ROTC building, replaced the American flag with a Palestinian one, and spray painted the outside with âDeath to the USâ and âBurn it all.â

And so, this is why protesters target Starbucks. Not only is its founder, Howard Schultz, a prominent Jewish businessman, but the coffee giant also is among the most prominent American brands. It is a veritable symbol of capitalism itself.

Neither of these worldviews make sense, but both erode the very fabric of our country. You canât have a reasoned argument with people who ignore history and facts. You canât have the compromises necessary to make a multi-ethnic democracy work if people see some of their neighbors as the embodiment of evil. You canât resolve conflicts peacefully if some believe that the stakes are literally life as you know it.

And yet, this is not surprising. As we have seen throughout history, no democracy with a severe antisemitism problem stays a democracy for long. As the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote, the hate that starts with the Jews never ends there. Antisemitism is an insatiable monster that consumes everything.

This is why the surge of anti-Jewish hate in America over this past year should be so troubling for all Americans regardless of where they pray or how they identify. This antipathy toward the Jewish community is setting the stage for a far larger fight in this country. Some might even call it a âbattle for the soul of America.â

One day, the hostages will come home, the current conflict will subside, and perhaps there will be peace for both people: safety and security for Israelis and dignity and equality for Palestinians. Iâm deeply committed to working towards this future.

But if we fail to stamp out the evil of antisemitism currently taking root on both sides of the political spectrum, it will fracture the very foundation of our country. And, if history is any indication, once that base is damaged, there is no guarantee that we will be able to fix it. Itâs up to us to halt this trend before itâs too late.","[1, 3, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH

OnÂ the evening ofÂ October 6th, 2023,Â my extended family gathered at my parents' homeÂ to mark theÂ 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.

As we listened to themÂ recall the surprise and shock of that day, and the personal and national responses to theÂ war, I was reminded of how thatÂ conflict, whose leadup became known as ""the mother of all intelligence failures"",Â led Israel on a path of new strategic thinkingÂ which included adopting a devilâs advocate approach when evaluating any course of military action.Â 

We had no idea how soon thisÂ notion would be tested.Â 

Hours later, at 6:29 on Shabbat morning, the earth shook.Â 

I was on my regular Saturday morning run when my phoneÂ lit upÂ with red alert notifications. Immediately after,Â explosions echoed around me with large parts of IsraelÂ under missile attack. What we didn't know thenÂ wasÂ that these projectilesÂ were just a diversion tactic, setting the stage for a land invasion by Hamas from Gaza into Israeli kibbutzim, towns, and even a music festival,Â to carry out the most horrific and deadlyÂ attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.Â 

October 7th changed my perception of human evil.Â I never deluded myselfÂ thinking it didnât exist, but the scale of the attack, the unimaginable cruelty, and the terrifying outcomes of that dayÂ led me to understand howÂ members of a society indoctrinated to hate others canÂ resort to inhumane barbarism.Â It was in that moment that I took on the mission to do everything possible to completely uproot such a dangerousÂ way ofÂ thinking.

In the days following October 7th,our minds were flooded withÂ a spectrum of thoughts, feelings and questions â aboutÂ our shattered sense of security,Â the impact on Israeli society as a whole - including on non-Jewish minoritiesÂ who were directly affected -the other fronts Israel is facingÂ and theÂ fate ofÂ over 140,000 Internally displaced Israelis.Â It soon became clear that above all else, two subjects would dominate our thinking from that point forward: the savage cruelty of the massacre and theÂ fate of theÂ hostages.Â 

As with every Israeli, I had people around me affected by the massacre.Â 

My sister-in-law's familyÂ was slaughtered in Kibbutz Beâeri. Only two of theÂ sixÂ Even family members survived: Tomer (12) and Nir (8). Their parents, Chen and Rinat, and their brothers, Alon (16) and Ido (14) â may their memories be a blessing -Â were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists while shieldingÂ the two young brothersÂ with their own bodiesÂ to protect them.

My daughterâs friend Cpl.Â Noa Marciano,Â was kidnapped to Gaza from her IDF base and was murdered in captivity a little over than a month later.Â Her body wasÂ later recovered by theÂ IDF and buried in Israel.Â 

The list it goes on and on â endless stories of heartbreak and horror, an emotional rollercoaster that never stops.Â AÂ heavy weight has been sitting on ourÂ hearts, not just for a moment,Â butÂ throughout theÂ entire year.Â 

Yet,Â amidstÂ this hardship, weÂ witnessed moving solidarity, unimaginable heroism from citizens and security personnel, and incredible resilience.Â InÂ the countryâs darkest hour, the Israeli spiritÂ hasÂ shone brightly âÂ helping bridgedisagreements and enabling Israeli society to stand united against all challenges.Â 

AndÂ alongside this Israeli spirit stood the unwavering support of Diaspora Jewry.Â 

Communities and organizations that in normal times have differing views on a variety of subjects stoodÂ unified in support of Israel,Â loudly calling for and working towards the release of the hostages. TheseÂ Jewish communities stood firmly with Israel, while confronting a tsunami of antisemitism and anti-IsraelÂ hate.Â This all led me to my second mission: ensuring Israeli society does not forget this moment in Jewish history, when we all stood togetherÂ In unity with Israel and the hostages, and against the rise of antisemitism and anti-Israel hate.

Of all the post-October 7 issues, the hostage situation is the most excruciating. This occupies my thoughts more than anything â the beautiful faces of the kidnapped children, women and men, are seen across the country and the world. My waking hours are spent thinking aboutÂ what more can we do to bring them home.

Reaching a deal must take precedence over everything else. WhileÂ  Israelâs security challenges will certainly remain for many years, a nation cannot allow its sons and daughters to remain in cruel captivity. ""PidyonÂ Shivuyimâ - freeing captives - is one of highest values in JudaismÂ â and this is what guides me. I know this will be hard and may require difficult steps on Israelâs part, but what other choice do we have? As long asÂ the hostages are not returned home, Israeli society cannot fully heal from the wounds of Oct. 7 and work towards rebuilding.Â 

And that is what I believe is the task before us. WeÂ mustÂ do all we can to push for the release of the hostages. We must also work to fortify the bonds of Jewish peoplehood linking us across the world, while simultaneously strengthening the IsraeliÂ values of family, community, respect and tolerance,Â andÂ rejecting those who seek to divide us through hate andÂ extremism. Only then will we, as individuals and as a society, be able to lift up our heads and rebuild from this terrible tragedy.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/anti-israel-protesters-celebrate-one-year-anniversary-hamass-october-7-attacks,"On Saturday, October 5, 2024, anti-Israel protesters around the world held an âInternational Day of Actionâ to kick off a multi-day celebration of the anniversary of Hamasâs October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Across more than 80 U.S. cities, protesters gathered for demonstrations that were largely characterized by explicit support for terror, including the October 7 attack itself. The weekendâs protest activity reflected the larger trends that emerged in the anti-Israel movement over the past year.Â 

The October 5 âInternational Day of Actionâ was just the start of a scheduled week of anti-Israel events centered around the one-year commemoration of the October attacks. Protests continued Sunday, October 6 in a number of additional cities. Beginning on Monday, October 7, National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is organizing a âWeek of Rageâ related to the anniversary, with dozens of chapters nationwide slated to participate with walkouts and other events on college campuses.

âInternational Day of Actionâ organizers included the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP), U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN) and ANSWER Coalition, among others.Â Â

Organizers shared an online announcement of the protests on August 24, with the slogan, âOne Year of Genocide, One Year of Resistanceâ and a photograph of a Palestinian man standing atop an Israeli military vehicle, taken after Hamas broke through the border fence on October 7. Similar messaging, much of which included imagery celebrating theOctober 7 attacks and phrases like âGaza Resists; Gaza Remains,â featured prominently on banners and signs carried by protesters nationwide during the day of action.Â 

At the October 5 and 6 protests, praise for terrorists and terrorism was front and center âÂ  on the materials displayed by protesters and in spoken remarks. Speakers and attendees lauded Hamas and other U.S.-designated terrorist groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis (Ansar Allah) in Yemen for their attacks against Israel over the past year.
Â 

New York City hosted one of the largest protests of the day, where Manolo De Los Santos âExecutive Director of the NY-based Peopleâs Forum, one of the âInternational Day of Actionâ co-sponsors â praised the so-called âResistance,â apparently alluding to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and other terror groups in the region by referring to the âresistance,â which has been a frequent rhetorical stand-in for terror groups among post-October 7 activists. He said, âWe salute the glorious Resistance â of the people of Yemen, of the people of Iraq, of the people of Iran, of the people of Lebanon, of the people of Gaza. All the people of the Arab world are teaching us a lesson. The only way to live with dignity is to fight, is to resist, is to never give up.â
Â 

Santos further reflected on the anti-Israel protests that his group and others organized in the days immediately after Hamasâs October 7 attack in 2023, doubling down nearly a year later by again characterizing Hamasâs October 7 attack as an admirable act of liberation rather than a violent act of terrorism.

Santos told the crowd: âDespite all these corrupt politicians trying to scare us, trying to demonize us, we came out into the streets. One year ago, we were right here doing the impossible, doing what no one thought was the right thing. But history has proven us right. On October 7, the Palestinian people broke out of a concentration camp. But they broke out not only for their own freedom, they broke out to wake up the world. They delivered a burning message to all our hearts and all our minds: The world has to rise up to fight back against U.S. imperialism.â
Â 

Speakers nationwide shared similar rhetoric. In Gainesville, FL, a protest leader with the local Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) chapter praised Hamas and Hezbollah, drawing cheers of support from the crowd. He said, âThe Resistance is stronger than itâs ever been. And we have seen that this weekâ¦[The] resilience of the Iranian forces. We have seen the strength of Hezbollah and the Lebanese Resistanceâ¦The strength, the power, the sumud [steadfastness] of the Palestinian Resistance in Gaza and the West Bankâ¦ âUntil victoryâ â that is the motto. Until victory!â
Â 

In Detroit, MI, Yemeni Liberation Movement (YLM) representative Monica Isaac spoke of âthe Al-Aqsa Flood,â using Hamasâs name for the October 7 attack, and the âAxis of Resistance,â a term which refers to Iran and its proxies of terrorist organizations in the Middle East. Isaac said, âRevolution is not an aesthetic, it is an ugly, arduous and dedicated process.â She praised âthe determination of steel the Yemini Resistance embodiesâ and how âthey are unmoved by the Zionist entity.â
Â 

In Chicago, IL, a speaker said, âThis year has been defined in the teachings of the Resistance, who broke through the wall, confirming for us that liberation by any means necessary is entirely inevitable. Who confirmed for us that Zionism in its most robust and dominant form will always beâ¦easily devastated.â The speaker concluded by expressing her desire for the âdestruction of the Zionist state and those who support it.â
Â 

Protesters also joined in celebrating terrorist groups; rally-goers in at least ten states displayed signs, flags, headbands or other paraphernalia that featured either the logos of U.S.-designated terrorist groups â including Hamas and Hezbollah as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) â or pictures of individuals affiliated with those terrorist groups.Â

In Washington, D.C., for example, one protester carried a Hamas flag while another held a sign with the caption, âKilling our leaders only makes us stronger,â alongside photographs of the recently killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and the recently killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. In San Diego, CA, a protester carried a sign that read, âOctober 7 was a prison break from Gaza concentration campâ alongside inverted red triangle imagery.
Â 

At the protests in New York, Los Angeles, and other cities, Writers Against the War on Gaza (WAWOG) members distributed the latest edition of their âNew York War Crimesâ publication, which they launched a year ago to mock the New York Times and to convey their own anti-Israel, pro-terror slant. This newest edition featured the headline âONE YEAR SINCE AL-AQSA FLOOD: REVOLUTION UNTIL VICTORY!â Protest organizers including NSJP and PYM promoted the publication on social media.
Â 

October 5 protesters carried signs celebrating Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Hamasâs military wing, and Leila Khaled, a longtime PFLP leader known for hijacking of two civilian airliners, both of whom have been regularly glorified by anti-Israel protesters over the past year.
Â 

Now-familiar chants also celebrated terrorism, including the refrains âYemen, Yemen, make us proud; Turn another ship aroundâ and âGaza called, Yemen answered, all Israeli ships are canceled,â alluding to Houthi attacks on Israeli ships.Â

Some protesters elevated antisemitic tropes, including equating Israel and Zionism with Nazism and the idea that Israel is somehow to blame for American domestic issues, demonstrated as support for the disproved conspiracy theory that U.S. financial support for Israel has led to slow relief response in U.S. regions devastated by Hurricane Helene.","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

Today is 10/7. This date has become an eternal shorthand for devastating loss and a deep well of resolve. It is also a sharp line drawn in our collective memory.

On October 6 -- the day before the horrific massacre by Hamas -- Israel, its friends and allies, and Jewish people across the world had no idea that we were about to be shaken and tested beyond our comprehension.

And then there was October 8, the day after our world was turned upside down. We were suddenly in a different world where an act of horrible savagery by Hamas had taken 1,200 lives in what felt like an instant, and over 250 people were taken hostage. Over one hundred remain in this cruel captivity.

Like some of you, Iâve been to Israel since the attacks. I have seen destroyed homes with bullet holes pockmarking the walls and dried blood on the floors. I went to the site of the Nova festival where innocent young people were hunted down and slaughtered -- or kidnapped to Gaza. And I've met with many of the families of those kidnapped, listening and seeing their pain and anguish, but also their resolve to do everything to bring their loved ones back home.

The attacks by Hamas, by Hezbollah and the Houthis and the direct onslaught by the largest patron of antisemitic terrorism, Iran, have sparked a fire here in the U.S. and throughout the world. While antisemitic incidents had already been on the rise, these attacks threw fuel onto the fire. We saw the impact almost immediately. Online. In the streets. On our campuses.

There have been over ten thousand antisemitic incidents in the year since 10/7. Ten thousand. This is by far the highest number of incidents in the U.S. that ADL has ever recorded. Antisemitic bomb threats against synagogues. Assaults against Jewish students on campus. Harassment online and in once-quiet communities. Similarly angry and dangerous incidents have been taking place around the globe at the same time.

I could go on with statistic after statistic, chilling case after chilling case. But hereâs the thing. With you and the rest of my friends in the ADL community, I donât have to.

Because every single one of you knows this story, and so many of you have been touched â whether by something that happened directly to you, to your children, to your loved ones or to those who are part of our extended community.

Today we mourn 10/7. May the memories of those slain that day be a blessing and may we all keep their goodness alive in our hearts. And for those still in captivity, may they be protected from harm and come home soon to your families.

Tomorrow, we start another year of the 10/8 world. And this is our challenge:

To fight for our brothers and sisters on the frontlines in Israel

To never stop shouting for the release of our hostages

To demonstrate compassion for innocent lives irrespective of their ethnicity or faith

To speak out against antisemitism, wherever it comes from.

And when we in the ADL community are testedâ¦ to respond with resolve, compassion and intent to make the world a better place.

Am Yisrael Chai. The people of Israel live.","[1, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.9, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/over-10000-antisemitic-incidents-recorded-us-oct-7-2023-according-adl,"New York, NY, October 6, 2024 â¦ There have been more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in the year since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel, according to ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) preliminary data. This is the highest number of incidents ever recorded in any single year periodÂ since ADL started tracking in 1979.

These newly released figures, from Oct. 7, 2023 to Sept. 24, 2024,Â represent an over 200-percent increase compared to the incidents reported to us during the same period a year before, which saw 3,325 incidents.

âToday, we mourn the victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel, marking one year since the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. From that day on, Jewish Americans havenât had a single moment of respite,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âInstead, weâve faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.â

According to the ADL Center on Extremism, which gathers reports and tracks antisemitic incident data, these more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents break down into the following categories:

Â·Â  Â  Â  Â Over 8,015 incidents of verbal or written harassment.

Â·Â  Â  Â  Â Over 1,840 incidents of vandalism.

Â·Â  Â  Â  Â Over 150 incidents of physical assault.

Moreover, at least 1,200 of these antisemitic incidents happened on college campuses. In the same period a year before, ADL recorded about 200 incidents, representing a 500-percent increase.

Of these incidents, over 2,000 occurred at Jewish institutions such as synagogues and Jewish centers. More than half of all incidents at Jewish institutions took the form of bomb threats (only 81 bomb threats against Jewish institutions were recorded in the same period in the prior year.)

ADLâs preliminary data also found that over 3,000 of all incidents took place during anti-Israel rallies, which featured regular explicit expressions of support for terrorist groups including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), one of the most concerningÂ antisemitic trends ADL captured since Oct. 7, 2023.

Each year, ADL tracks incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault in the United States. This data is published annually in theÂ Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. In 2023, ADL recorded an unprecedented total number of 8,873 antisemitic incidents, a 140-percent increase from the previous year.

ADL expects these preliminary figures to increase as it receives more incident reports from partners, law enforcement and victims. Final antisemitic incident data for 2024 will be published in the spring of 2025.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/j7-task-force-statement-anniversary-oct-7-hamas-attack-israel,"New York, NY, October 7, 2024 â¦ On the anniversary of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, the J7 Large Communitiesâ Task Force Against Antisemitism issued the following statement:Â 

We are leaders of seven of the largest Jewish communities outside of Israel. One year ago, our communities were shocked and devasted by the horrifying terror attack on Israel.Â  Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups massacred more than 1200 innocent people, young and old, who were burned, shot, tortured and raped in their homes, at a music festival, on a morning walk, or trying to flee their attackers.Â  October 7 was the single deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.Â Â 

One year ago, over 250 people were ripped from their families, homes and friends and taken into Gaza as hostages.Â  These hostages represent over two dozen nationalities, including citizens of our own countries, and include Jews, Christians, Muslims, Druze, Buddhists, Hindus and atheists. According to Hamas, their crime was being in a Jewish state. Today, 366 days later, 101 hostages remain in Gaza, their fate and condition still unknown.Â Â 

On this tragic anniversary, we also mark one year of unbridled, unprecedented antisemitism, that has targeted Jews around the globe. Our community organizations and governments have documented a staggering increase of antisemitic incidents since October 7. Jewish individuals and institutions have suffered violent attacks, arson, graffiti, harassment, and discrimination, hostility and isolation.Â  We have been victimized in our homes, in the streets, on campuses, and online.Â Â 

One year later, we remain united in our call on our seven governments and on the international community:Â 

Â 

To exercise maximum pressure on Hamas to immediately release all hostages still being held in Gaza.Â Â Â 
To support Israel as it remains under constant attack from Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, and their state sponsor, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and others who seek its eradication.Â Â Â Â 
To take concrete steps to fight antisemitism through legal, educational and whole-of-society strategies.Â  The Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism, released in Buenos Aires in July 2024 and endorsed by over 40 countries and regional groupings, provide guidance for policies and actions that can be implemented by national governments, international organizations and civil societies alike.Â Â Â 

On this tragic anniversary, we continue to mourn those we have lost and to face significant challenges ahead for Israel and the Jewish people. Yet, we reaffirm the resilience and vibrancy of the global Jewish community. We stand ready to continue to collaborate with our partners in government and civil society to ensure a future of security and well-being for all.Â Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/hind-rajab-foundation-and-dyab-abou-jahjah,"Background on HRF:

The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) was formed in Belgium in September 2024 by Lebanese-Belgian activists Dyab Abou Jahjah and Karim Hassoun. The organization is named after 6-year-old Hind Rajab, who was killed in Gaza in February 2024 allegedly by Israel, though an initial Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) probe found there were no troops in the area at the time.

In an article in The Nation, in December 2024, Abou Jahjah claimed the mission of the HRF is âto make sure that the soldiers who murdered Hind meet justiceâalongside their leaders and every other IDF murderer.â

The HRF focuses on doxxing and launching legal cases against Israelis who have served in the IDF (military service is mandatory in Israel), and has to date submitted legal cases and petitions in eight countries against 28 individuals for alleged âwar crimes.â On October 12, 2024, the HRF announced that it had submitted complaints to the International Criminal Court (ICC) against 1,000 Israeli soldiers. The organization has encouraged countries involved in the ICC case against Israel to issue arrest warrants against those it named.

Following the November 2024 pogromÂ  in Amsterdam against visiting Israeli soccer fans, HRF filed a complaint against the Israeli fans, claiming âincitement to hatred,â âgenocidal rhetoric,â âhate speech,â and âproperty destruction.â

While presenting himself as a civil rights activist, Dyab Abou Jahjah joined and received military training from Hezbollah before moving to Belgium, has repeatedly venerated Hezbollah and its late leader Hassan Nasrallah on social media, justified the October 7 massacre, denying that Hamas committed any rapes or ""systematic slaughter"" and has argued it is not antisemitic to say ""effing Jews.""

Who is Dyab Abou Jahjah?Â 

Dyab Abou Jahjah was born in Lebanon, where he joined Hezbollah, and âhad military trainingâ, something he is âproud of.â In 1991, he moved to Belgium.Â 

In 2000, he co-founded the Arab European League (AEL) with Karim Hassoun, (pictured below at a mock funeral for Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, held outside the Kazerne DossinÂ memorial and museum in Belgium, which marks the sight of a Nazi transit camp used for transporting Jews and Romani people to Auschwitz-Birkenau).



Â In 2002, Abou Jahjah was arrested in Antwerp, Belgium for inciting riots and resisting arrest. In 2004, SalonÂ reported that another of the co-founders of the AEL, Ahmed Azzouz, had âthreatenedâ an âalmost unpreventableâ attack on Antwerpâs Jewish community if it did not âcancel its support for Jewish policy as fast as possible and distance itself from Israel.â

Although Abou Jahjah claims to be a secular critic of Islamism, the 2004 Salon article quotes his desire for a âsharocracyâ (a reference to Sharia Law) in Europe, in which âthe sale of alcoholâ and âsexually suggestive advertisingâ would be banned.

Abou Jahjah is also on record as saying that 9/11 gave him a âsweet feeling of revenge.â

In a January 2006 article on the AEL website, Abou Jahjah wrote that Europe had made âthe cult of the Holocaust and Jew-worshipingâ into an âalternative religion.â

The same year, Abou Jahjah travelled to Lebanon, having indicated a desire to rejoin Hezbollah to fight Israel in the Second Lebanon War, sparking calls for the withdrawal of his Belgian passport for treason. In an interview with Vrij Nederland, Abou Jahjah stated that âin Lebanon [â¦] I was close to the camp of Hezbollah and its allies. They have power and then doors open.â

Upon returning to Belgium, he joined an Iranian regime-funded, Hezbollah-linked group called the International Union of Parliamentarians for Palestine (IUPFP).

Also in 2006, the AEL published a series of antisemitic and Holocaust-denying cartoons in The Netherlands, claiming that this was in response to the Danish Cartoon controversy earlier that year. One AEL cartoon portrayed Hitler in bed with Anne Frank, with the caption âwrite this one in your diary Anne!â Another cartoon portrayed two men standing over a pile of skeletons, with one saying, âI donât think theyâre Jewsâ and the other replying âwe have to get to the 6000000 somehow!â




Claiming to go after âthe Westâs own âsacred cowsââ, Abou Jahjah wrote, âI call upon every free sole [sic] among Arabs to use the Danish flag as a substitute for toilet paper. To illustrate every wall with graffiti making fun of everything Europe holds as holy: dancing rabbis on the carcasses of Palestinian children, hoax gas-chambers built in Hollywood in 1946 with Steven Spielbergâs approval stamp, and Aids spreading fagots (sic).""

On October 18, 2023, Abou Jahjah stated in a Facebook post. âI cannot bear to hear what they call the Hebrew language. Its sound grates on my ears like a discordant noise [â¦] It is an artificial monstrosity, a Frankenstein of a language, hideous in its essence, just like that illegitimate state whose official language it claims to be.â




Despite claiming to differentiate between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, Abou Jahjah has nevertheless defended the singling out of Jews, and compared Jews to Germans during World War II, saying âNot everyone saying, âeffing Jewsâ is antisemitic [â¦] When, in their anger at the injustice committed by the âJewish State,â such a person says, âEffing Jews,â it is not necessarily antisemitic. It is like when people said, âEffing Germansâ in 1943; they did not necessarily hate Germans.â

In 2009, Abou Jahjah signed an open letter demanding the âunconditional removal of Hamas and all other Palestinian liberation organizations from the European list of proscribed terrorist organizations.â

Support for October 7:

On October 7, 2023, Abou Jahjah justified Hamasâ attacks on Israeli kibbutzim as they were unfolding, calling the communities âsettlementsâ and claiming that the Hamas militias were returning ârefugees.âÂ 


Well after the nature of the October 7 attack became clear, Abu Jahjah continued to justify and support it, saying âanyone calling October 7 âa pogromâ or an antisemitic attack is playing into Israeli propaganda [â¦]â

He has also tried to diminish and excuse the October 7 attack, saying that it involved âno planned or systematic slaughterâ, that âthe orders to Hamas fighters was not to attack civiliansâ and that âno babies were deliberately killed [â¦] Nor were any women rapedâ.

Support for Terrorists:

The day after the killing by Israel of Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, Abu Jahjah eulogized him in an X post, praising Hezbollahâs support for Hamas and for its role in the Syrian civil war, in which Hezbollah supported the Assad regime, leading to multiple atrocities, including the mass killing and starving of Palestinians in the Yarmouk refugee camp.

Likewise, the day after Israel killed Hamas leader and architect of the October 7 attacks, Yahya Sinwar, Abou Jahjah eulogized him, calling him a âresistance leaderâ who âshowed the way.â",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

The attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7, 2023, had profound and far-reaching effects on Israelis, Jewish communities around the world and many others.Â  Across Latin American, several Jewish communities faced a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents, diverse government responses, and escalating security concerns. The aftermath of this attack has not only exposed the vulnerability of Jewish populations in the region but has also highlighted the complex geopolitical dynamics that influence the safety and well-being of these communities.

In addition, the presence of the Iranian-regime back Hezbollah terrorist organization in the region further exacerbates these tensions, posing a direct threat to Jewish communities. The dismantling of Islamic terrorist cells in Argentina and Brazil underscores the severity of the threat, highlighting the need for vigilance and proactive measures to ensure the safety of Jewish communities.

Historically, antisemitism in Latin America tends to spike during conflicts in Israel and the Middle East, though not to the same degree as in other regions. In Latin America, these incidents are generally confined to acts of vandalism, isolated acts of violence, and a significant rise in online hate speech and media disinformation. Unlike Europe and the US, where antisemitic attacks can be more frequent and severe, Latin American antisemitism manifests primarily in graffiti, harassment, and biased governments and media coverage. Social media platforms become hotbeds for spreading antisemitic rhetoric, often fueled by disinformation, misinformation and anti-Zionist narratives promoted by certain regional media outlets.

Rising Antisemitism: A Disturbing Trend

The surge in antisemitism across Latin America following the Hamas October 7 attack is deeply worrisome. Countries like Brazil, Argentina and Chile have seen a significant increase in antisemitic vandalism, harassment, online hate speech, and even threats against Jewish institutions.Â 

The most egregious examples include violent protests outside Jewish institutions in Chile, which involved antisemitic rhetoric. In Uruguay, during the annual International Womenâs March, a group of women and girls marched showcasing an antisemitic puppet marked with a Star of David and pierced by a spear. In Brazil, there was a verbal and physical attack on a Jewish store owner, and in Mexico City there were attempts to set the Israeli embassy on fire.Â 

Argentina experienced a 44% increase in antisemitic incidents in 2023 compared to 2022, according to the DelegaciÃ³n de Asociaciones Israelitas de Argentina (DAIA). 57% of the incidents reported in 2023 occurred during the October-December period. 65% of antisemitic incidents occurred online and 35% in person, a sharp increase from 2022 when only 19% of the antisemitic cases occurred in person.Â 

In Brazil, CONIB reported that between October 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, there were 1,119 reports, an increase of 800% compared to 125 incidents reported during the same period in 2022.Â 

In Mexico, mentions of the conflict in social media skyrocketed after October 7th, rising from an average of 13,000 daily mentions before October 7th, to 171,000 per day after the attack, with 28% of these mentions being negative with antisemitic undertones.Â 

These figures underscore the severity of the spike in antisemitism in the region, exacerbated by protests and online hate speech targeting Jewish communities and institutions.

Government Responses: A Mixed Bag

The responses of Latin American governments to the October 7 attack and the subsequent rise in antisemitism have been varied and, in some cases, deeply troubling. Countries like Colombia and Bolivia have taken provocative stances, severing diplomatic ties with Israel and, in the case of Colombia, even fueling antisemitic rhetoric through inflammatory statements by President Gustavo Petro. Likewise, Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, whose country severed ties with Israel in 2009, has made incendiary remarks against Israel and Zionists. These actions have left Jewish communities feeling vulnerable and mourning the loss of their countries' traditional closeness with Israel, their ancestral homeland.

Brazil, Chile, and Mexico have shown less support for Israel in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks, often aligning with international efforts to delegitimize the Jewish state. Even as few of these countriesâ citizens were fatal victims or were taken as hostages by Hamas, these nationsâ governments have backed measures in international legal forums, notably those spearheaded by South Africa, aimed at isolating Israel on the global stage. Brazil, under President Lula, has taken a more critical stance on Israeli policies, while Chile's government, led by President Gabriel Boric, has been openly hostile, recalling its ambassador from Israel and pursuing accusations of war crimes against Israel in international courts. Mexico, traditionally more neutral, has also shifted towards supporting anti-Israel resolutions, reflecting a broader regional trend of distancing from Israel and aligning with movements that challenge its legitimacy in global institutions.

Peru and El Salvador condemned Hamas for the October 7th attack, but their responses have since become more neutral and lukewarm. Initially aligned with global condemnation, both countries have avoided taking strong pro-Israel positions as the conflict continued. In contrast, Ecuador showed more active support, with its Foreign Minister visiting Israel amidst the war in September 2024.

On the other hand, the governments of Argentina, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Panama, Paraguay and Uruguay, have taken a more supportive approach, maintaining (and even strengthening) diplomatic relations with Israel while enhancing security around Jewish institutions. These countries have recognized the seriousness of the threat and have acted swiftly to protect their Jewish citizens. However, the overall landscape remains precarious, with the actions of some governments contributing to a hostile environment for Jewish communities in the region.

The Role of Disinformation: HispanTV's Influence

The spread of antisemitic and anti-Israel disinformation by media outlets like HispanTV has played a nefarious role in shaping public opinion and inciting antisemitism in Latin America. This Iranian-backed Spanish-language channel has been a prominent platform for promoting anti-Zionist narratives, directly contributing to the rise of antisemitic sentiment across the region. The influence of such media outlets cannot be underestimated, as they fuel hostility towards Jewish communities and severely harm efforts to combat antisemitism.

Security Concerns: The Growing Threat of Terrorism

In addition to the rise in antisemitism, Jewish communities in Latin America face a significant threat from Islamist terrorist networks, particularly Hezbollah. The presence of these networks in the Tri-Border Area between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay poses a direct threat to Jewish institutions. The successful dismantling of an Islamic terrorist cell in Mendoza, Argentina, in August 2024 and a Brazilian cell in November 2023 is a stark reminder of the immediate risk these groups pose. While this operation prevented further attacks, the existence of such networks remains a pressing security concern for both local governments and Jewish communities.

Community Resilience: A Call for Vigilance and Cooperation

Despite these challenges, Jewish communities across Latin America have shown resilience. They have organized public awareness campaigns, worked closely with local governments to enhance security, and taken proactive measures to protect themselves. However, the long-term effects of this rising antisemitism and the broader geopolitical landscape remain uncertain. The situation calls for continued vigilance, cooperation between Jewish communities and authorities, and proactive measures to safeguard the future of Jewish life in Latin America.

ââÂ 
ConclusionÂ âââ

The October 7, 2023, attack on Israel has had a deep effect on Jewish communities in Latin America, causing a rise in antisemitism, diplomatic tensions, and increasing security risks. Regional governments have responded in varied waysâsome offering protection, while others have worsened the situation with negative provocative actions and rhetoric. Disinformation and Islamist terrorist networks, including those funded by and backed by the Iranian-regime, add to the complexity, making the safety of Jewish communities a critical issue.Â 

While Jewish communities must stay alert and collaborate with authorities to safeguard their security, Latin American governments must do more to ensure their Jewish communities are better protected and antisemitism is addressed in a more meaningful way. This includes adopting the IHRA definition, declaring Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist organizations, investigating the links between HispanTV and sanctioned Iranian regime entities and officials, and designating HispanTV as a foreign state influence operation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Furthermore, governments must integrate comprehensive educational programs that highlight both the rich history of local Jewish communities and the Holocaust, which will contribute towards promoting cultural and religious awareness, dispelling ignorance and hate, and fostering understanding and respect.Â Â 

Failure on the part of Latin American governments to take concrete steps aimed at seriously addressing issues of antisemitism will likely have broad implications beyond the Jewish community, adversely impacting many aspects of society and beyond.","[1, 3, 4]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.5}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/happy-rosh-hashanah,"As we begin the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah tomorrow at sundown, we want to share insights from ADL Rabbinic Fellow David Wolpe with you. We hope that everyone in the ADL community can find something important to consider in his essay about how we can all aspire to push for a world without hate in the days to come.

Although Rosh Hashanahâ¯often sparks thoughts about the state of theâ¯world, it also asks us to look inside ourselves. I find the teaching that follows helpful both to understand how I should look at events and how I should hold myself in a frightening and unsettling time.

Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler was a spiritual guideâ¯in Israelâ¯in theâ¯1900s. He taught somethingâ¯very wiseâ¯about our internal battles that is importantâ¯for everyoneâ¯to remember in this year of so much tumult and discord and pain.â¯I want to shareâ¯his insightsâ¯with you and the entire ADL communityâ¯as we approach the Jewish High Holidays.

Napoleon once declared that every battle is decided in the first fifteen minutes. Rabbi Dessler points to a sort of parallel in internal battles, but it doesnât even take fifteen minutes. Indeed, he says,â¯certain battles are decided before the battle is even joined. Â 

Let me explain:

Dessler taught that all of us have aâ¯nukudat bechira â a tipping point in making decisions. For every person that point is different. If you put two salads in front of me, I have to choose which one to eat. But if you place a salad and a ham sandwich in front of me, I donât have to choose. Because I keep kosher and therefore donât eat pork products (and moreover am a vegetarian!), there is noâ¯decision point needed.â¯A prior choice has already been made.â¯The battle was long since won. I stand, in terms of the food decision, in conquered territory.

On this Rosh Hashanah,â¯we understand that much of what has happened this year has forced people to make choices: how they will react, how vocal they will be, how to relate to others who do not share the same views. On October 7, in the face of the horror that is ongoing, many people had to make a choice and to hold fast to what was right (and sadly, for some, to what was not right) throughout the year. But for manyâ¯of us,â¯theâ¯real choiceâ¯cameâ¯long ago. We knew we would speak up against prejudice and hatred and antisemitism. Â 

Now we face a new year. Newâ¯yearsâ¯are not only about resolutions to change, they are about renewing the convictions we already carry, the choices we have already made. God, ourâ¯teachingsâ¯tellâ¯us, renews creation daily. We too renew ourselves daily. After the anguish of the year that hasâ¯passed, this Rosh Hashanah will bring us more strength, greater resolveâ¯and a deeper sense of the community of those who share our passions. It is a time to strengthen the choices we have already made to speak up against the proliferating hatreds and prejudices that threaten us, Israel and the larger human community. Â 

The Jewish people,â¯along withâ¯those who supportâ¯the Jewishâ¯people,â¯are going through a time of trial. Rosh Hashanahâ¯is here to remind us of what we already believe, the choices we have made long ago inside ourselves: to fight for what is good, to believe in the possibility ofâ¯change, to broaden our embrace and deepen our souls.â¯May this year find us true to the missions we have already accepted, and be prepared for new undertakings to better ourselves, preserve our people and heal the world.

As we forge ahead, ADL is so grateful to have your support in thisâ¯struggleâ¯for a better world, Fighting Hate for Good.

We send you and yours wishes of health and happiness in the year to come.","[3, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.8, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-appoints-fbi-veteran-vice-president-global-safety-security,"New York, NY, October 1, 2024 â¦ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today appointed veteran federal law enforcement executive Steve Gonzalez as its new vice president of global safety and security. A longtime leader at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Gonzalez most recently served as assistant special agent in charge of the FBIâs New York Criminal Division.

âWe are pleased to welcome Steve Gonzalez into our top security leadership position at ADL,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âIn the wake of the October 7 massacre in Israel, the Jewish community has faced a rising tide of antisemitism and emerging security threats that we could never have imagined a year ago. Steveâs experience will help us to detect, monitor and mitigate these threats and to coordinate our work directly with national and local law enforcement as well as with law enforcement agencies overseas.â

Gonzalez has served nearly 26 years in government service. After serving as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy, he joined the FBI as a special agent assigned to the New York Division, where he worked on international terrorism investigations as part of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. In 2014, he was promoted to Supervisory Special Agent in the FBIâs counterterrorism division headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Two years later he returned to the New York Criminal Division to establish the first ever Joint Major Theft Task Force. Throughout his tenure, the NY criminal division has successfully executed hundreds of arrests and indictments of transnational organized crime syndicates.

In addition to his experience leading criminal investigations, Gonzalez is a licensed clinical and forensic psychologist, and throughout his tenure in New York he has served as a member of the Crisis Negotiation Team and field coordinator for the bureauâs Behavioral Analysis Unit.

âWith the rise of hate crimes and terrorism at home and abroad, I cannot think of another law enforcement leader more experienced and capable than Steve to sustain the ADLâs unique role in protecting our freedoms and human values,â said former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh. âIt has been my privilege to be Steveâs FBI colleague for many years, where his leadership in overseeing complex investigations, counterterrorism, hate crimes, national security and international threat mattersÂ is renowned and immensely respected.â

âSteve Gonzalez is an inspired choice for this position. His depth and experience from his many years in the FBI have forged a well-rounded investigator,â said John Miller, former NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Counterterrorism. âSteve has led teams in criminal investigation, counterterrorism cases, and worked with multiple agencies on task forces involved in mitigating the most dangerous threats.â

In his new role at ADL, Gonzalez will be charged with overseeing all aspects of security operations at ADL. ADL Global Security leads the planning and deployment of strategies and programs to support the safety and security of ADL staff, physical offices and public events around the world.

Gonzalez is a graduate of Tufts University, where he earned a bachelorâs degree in clinical psychology. He holds a Psy.D. and M.S. in Clinical Psychology (forensic concentration) from Nova Southeastern University, College of Psychology.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-social-media-scorecard-finds-major-platforms-routinely-fail-act,"New York, NY, September 30, 2024 â¦ A new scorecard released today by ADL (Anti-Defamation League) found that five major social media platforms â Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and X â routinely fail to act on antisemitic hate reported through regular channels available to users.Â 

The ADL Center for Technology and Society (CTS) evaluated both policy and enforcement around antisemitism and issued grades to each of the five platforms based on a fixed set of criteria.

X (formerly Twitter) scored the lowest with an âFâ â as most of the platformâs actions consisted in limiting the problematic contentâs visibility. While ADL credited X for taking action, X did not, like other platforms, remove the hateful content. Additionally, Facebook and TikTok each received a âCâ; YouTube and Instagram each earned a âC-minus.â

âSocial media platforms are still falling far too short when it comes to moderating antisemitic and anti-Israel content,â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âIn the aftermath of the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, Jewish users are encountering more antisemitic slurs and harassment on social media than ever before. Itâs not hard to detect this hate, but it takes leadership to consistently enforce the rules.â

ADL researchers tested how well the five platforms enforced their policies against hateful content in two specific areas: antisemitic conspiracy theories, and the term âZionistâ used as a slur. The scorecard found that while all five platforms have appropriate policies in place to respond to such hateful rhetoric (except for X, which does not have a policy specifically prohibiting misinformation), they routinely fell short on enforcement for average users.

The scorecard also found that most platforms only took action when ADL escalated the reports through direct channels unavailable to regular users. And even then, platforms only acted on some of the hateful content.Â 

In the year since Oct. 7, ADL hasÂ documented a dramatic increase in antisemitic hate online.Â ADLâs annual report on online hate and harassment found that 47 percent of Jews saw antisemitic content or conspiracy theories related to the Israeli-Hamas war, compared to 29 percent of Americans overall. The hateful language has in many cases shifted, however, and new antisemitic conspiracy theories have taken shape alongside the resurfacing of old ones.Â 

âWe have published several studies evaluating how platforms respond to antisemitism when reported by average users. Disturbingly, this scorecard had the worst response rate for average user reporting weâve ever seen,â said Daniel Kelley, Interim Director of the ADL Center for Technology and Society. âThough we are encouraged by the actions platforms took when we reported through our âtrusted flaggerâ channels, we urge tech companies to conduct comprehensive audits of how their platforms moderate antisemitic content to understand why this deeply concerning gap exists between platform policy and user reporting.â
Â 

Methodology

To test each platformâs enforcement of its antisemitism policies, ADL first reported individual pieces of content using tools available to a regular user. After a week, researchers checked to see whether any action had been taken. For content where no action or partial action (such as limiting the contentâs visibility) was taken, ADL escalated the content to direct points of contact at the companies, most often via âtrusted flaggerâ partnerships.Â 

ADL also evaluated each platformâs policies on antisemitic conspiracy theories and slurs. When comparing policies to actual content, nuances often arise, making case-by-case determinations necessary for a large share of potentially violative content. Each piece of content escalated to the platformsâ trusted flaggers was evaluated by ADLâs internal experts on the platformsâ policies.Â 

Following the trusted flaggersâ reviews of the remaining content, ADL evaluated each platform on its rate of action against content reported as a regular user and its cumulative rate of action after trusted flagger escalations.


Recommendations for PlatformsÂ 

Improve user reporting. Although we recognize the challenges of moderating at scale, these platforms should be able to ingest reports, review content, and act on clearly hateful content in less than a week.
Fix the gap between policy and enforcement. Companies should begin by conducting an internal audit to assess 1) whether staff are prepared to recognize and act on antisemitic content; 2) whether current policies address the multidimensional nature of antisemitism; 3) their enforcement capacity and effectiveness; and 4) support mechanisms for users who encounter or are targeted by antisemitic hate and harassment.
Provide independent researchers with data access, including access to archives of moderated content.
Review reported content in context. Multiple reports or other signals on a single piece of content may provide context for content that otherwise does not appear violative.
Follow emerging trends and adversarial shifts as they shift over time. These changes have only accelerated for antisemitic hate since Oct. 7.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-brandeis-center-standwithus-launch-antisemitism-helpline-ma-and-ny-k-12,"Brandeis Center/ADL/StandWithUs Expand Helpline on Antisemitism in K-12 Schools to Massachusetts and New York

Boston, MA, September 30, 2024 ... The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), and StandWithUs, along with a coalition of leading law firms, today announced the launch of a helpline in K-12 schools to provide pro bono legal assistance to parents whose children are experiencing antisemitism in Massachusetts and New York. The helpline follows a successful pilot program in California, the first state for which the hotline was launched after a series of troubling antisemitic incidents in the stateâs K-12 schools.

Antisemitic incidents in elementary, middle and high schools in MA and NY have increased significantly over the last year. ReportedÂ incidents in K-12 schools in MA nearly doubled in 2023 -- 101 (up from 53 incidents in 2022)Â whileÂ incidents in K-12 schools in NY climbed to 173 (up from 53 incidents in in 2022).

The alarming rise in both the sheer number and intensity of antisemitic incidents in K-12 schools in New York and Massachusetts have made it clear that parents, students and educators need an option for legal help,Â said Peggy Shukur, ADL Vice President, East Division. âParticularly in situations where responses to antisemitism are inadequate or worse, access to high-quality legal assistance is a crucial tool to ensure a safe learning environment. By providing these legal efforts, this helpline will empower Jewish students, teachers and parents to take action to fight against antisemitic harassment and bigotry.â

âDay after day, students across our state are facing a barrage of antisemitic incidents in K-12 schools,â said Scott Richman, ADL NY/NJ Regional Director. âIncreasingly, those incidents have required legal assistance. Alongside our impactful anti-hate education programs, this pro bono legal helpline is a welcome addition to the arsenal of tools at our disposal to fight the antisemitic prejudice that we see in our schools.â

As a result of the California K-12 pilot program, in February 2024, Brandeis and ADL filed aÂ complaint with the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights (OCR) against the Berkeley school district for failing to take action to end the nonstop bullying and harassment of Jewish students by peers and teachers.Â Since its launch, the CA hotline has received an influx of K-12 incidents. These include a wide variety of antisemitic incident reports includingÂ Jewish students being harassed, intimidated, and threatened with violence because of their religion.

""The barrage of anti-Semitic harassment, intimidation, and attacks against Jewish students is unfortunately not contained within the campus gates,â stated Brandeis Center Vice Chair and General Counsel Rachel Lerman. ""Coast to coast, Jewish K-12 students have been verbally and physically bullied, threatened, and assaulted by peers who absorb anti-Israel and antisemitic rhetoric from some of their teachers. They have been told they are hated and should all be killed, spat on, called dirty Jew, told to go to the gas chambers, slandered, and threatened with violence.Â Administrations cannot be allowed to turn a blind eye to the intimidation, bullying and anti-Semitic rhetoric their students endure within their schools. Our team of lawyers stand ready to use the law to hold schools accountable to enforce their own rules as Jewish students are subjected to a virulently hostile environment. This must stop.""Â 

Parents, teachers, and other interested adults in MA and NY can use theÂ Legal Protection K-12 Helpline to report incidents of antisemitic discrimination, intimidation, harassment, vandalism or violence that may necessitate legal action. Lawyers will conduct in-depth information-gathering interviews with persons who file reports. In some instances, they may provide pro bono representation on behalf of victims or provide referrals to organizations that can provide non-legal assistance. The lawyers will also, with permission of the individuals involved, use the reports to better understand the scope of the problem and report it to officials responsible for ensuring the laws are followed. If schools do not take action, they will be held accountable.

âCJPâs Center for Combating Antisemitism is excited to support this important hotline as a proactive resource for parents, educators, and students,â said Melissa Garlick, Senior Director, Combating Antisemitism and Building Civic Engagement at Combined Jewish Philanthropies (CJP). âThis initiative will serve as a valuable tool for our community to help address and prevent antisemitism, offering guidance, support, and solutions to foster safe and respectful learning environments. By working together, weâre empowering school communities to not only respond to incidents but to build a culture of inclusion, understanding, and mutual respect.âÂ 

âConsistent with our longstanding commitment to combating antisemitism in schools, on campus, and within the community, StandWithUs remains proud to be part of this coalition dedicated to protecting K-12 students from antisemitic harassment and discrimination, said Carly Gammill, Director of Legal Policy at the StandWithUs Saidoff Legal Department. âThe expansion of the initiative into Massachusetts and New York comes at a time when antisemitism continues to plague students in our nationâs schools and will help ensure broader access to legal resources for students seeking to address attacks against their Jewish identity.

This expansion builds upon continued efforts to address antisemitism in a variety of educational settings. In November 2023, Brandeis and ADL, along with Hillel International, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, and other leading law firms, launched theÂ Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL), a helpline to assist students and faculty experiencing antisemitism on college campuses. More thanÂ 650 college students and faculty have used this important resource to report incidents and request assistance.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits educational institutions that receive federal funding from discriminating against, or allowing others to discriminate against, students on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, and national origin. Title VI protects Jews based on their shared ancestral and ethnic identity. The Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights recognizes that harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful under Title VI.

Today, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) announced an expanded partnership with Moishe House to launch fifteen new âWords to Actionâ trainings across Europe, Latin America, and Israel. This initiative aims to equip Jewish young adults in their 20s with the tools and knowledge to recognize and combat antisemitism in their communities. As the new academic year begins, it's crucial to support not only Jewish students on campus but also young Jews who, despite no longer being students, are still facing a surge in antisemitism.Â 

Â 

Across Europe, America, and beyond, tensions in the Middle East have often fueled a rise in antisemitic incidents, especially in the aftermath of Hamasâs October 7 attack on Israel. With nearly 40% of people in seven countries with significant Jewish populations endorsing antisemitic tropes, ADLâs Words to Action has become a highly sought-after program. It equips Jewish youth with tools to understand and confront antisemitism, anti-Israel bias, stereotypes, and antisemitic hate speech. Notably, antisemitism is most prevalent among Millennials (b. 1981-1996) in these countries, a main target age group of Moishe House participants.Â 

Â 

In response to the surge in antisemitism worldwide, ADLâs âWords to Actionâ program, led by experienced educators in 29 countries, continues to empower young leaders to address antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. Through this program, participants gain tools to tackle antisemitic stereotypes, prejudice, hate speech, and bias incidents.Â 

Â 

âAs antisemitism continues to spread across borders and communities, itâs crucial that Jewish young adults are equipped with the tools and knowledge to effectively respond to antisemitism. By expanding our partnership with Moishe House, we are empowering a new generation to build resilience and confidently stand up against antisemitism.â said Dalia Grinfeld, ADL Associate Director for European Affairs.Â Â 

Â 

""We are honored to expand our partnership with the Anti-Defamation League. This partnership will provide our community builders the opportunity to gain the knowledge and confidence needed to stand up to antisemitism as they create and lead their own local Jewish communities. Leadership development is an important part of being a Moishe House community builder and knowing how to appropriately handle situations of antisemitism is, unfortunately, a critical skillset for young Jewish leaders today. This partnership is not just about addressing today's challenges of rising antisemitism but about equipping our community builders to help build a future where every Jewish person can thrive free from discrimination and prejudice,â said David Cygielman, Moishe House Founder and CEO.Â

New York, NY, September 23, 2024Â â¦Â  Data released today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation reveals that reported hate crime incidents across the country reached a record high of 11,862 in 2023. In 2023, reported single-bias anti-Jewish hate crime incidents rose to 1,832 incidents, a sharp increase of 63 percent from 2022, and the highest number ever recorded by the FBI since it began collecting data in 1991.

Although Jews only make up aroundÂ 2 percent of the U.S. population, reported single-bias anti-Jewish hate crimes comprised 15 percent of all hate crimes and 68 percent of all reported religion-based hate crimes in 2023, which is consistent with patterns from prior years.

âAt a time when the Jewish community is still suffering from the sharp rise in antisemitism following Hamasâs Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, the record-high number of anti-Jewish hate crime incidents is unfortunately entirely consistent with the Jewish communityâs experience and ADLâs tracking,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âHate crimes are uniquely harmful, traumatizing both the individual and their community.â

According to the FBI data, a clear majority of hate crime incidents across the country (approximately 51.5 percent) in 2023 were motivated by bias based on race, ethnicity or national origin â as has been the case for decades â with reported anti-Black hate crimes comprising the single largest portion of those incidents.Â Reported single-bias anti-Hispanic or Latino hate crime incidents increased from 738 in 2022 to 812 in 2023. Reported single-bias anti-Muslim hate crime incidents rose from 158 in 2022 to 236 in 2023. Reported anti-LGBTQ+ hate crime incidents increasedÂ from 2,391 in 2022 to 2,557 in 2023. And reported single-bias religion-based hate crimes, which represented approximately 23 percent of all reported hate crimes, rose from 2,042 in 2022 to 2,699 in 2023.

ADL, which keeps its own count of both criminal and non-criminal acts of hate against Jews, counted a total of 8,873Â antisemitic incidents in 2023, a 140-percent increase from the prior year, and the highest number on record since ADL began tracking such data in 1979. Assaults â considered the most serious incident type because it involves person-on-person physical violence â increased by 45 percent in 2023.

According to the FBI data released today, a total of 16,009 law enforcement agencies, which represent 83.5 percent of the agencies enrolled in the hate crime data collection program, participated in hate crimes reporting for 2023. Despite an increase in the number of law enforcement agencies that participated in reporting data to the FBI in 2023 â for the first time in six years â far too many agencies still either do not participate in reporting or are likely not participating in a fully accurate way.

âAlthough itâs encouraging to see more law enforcement agencies participating in reporting hate crimes data in 2023, we still have a long way to go toward ensuring comprehensive data collection that provides a more accurate picture of the lived experience of targeted communities across the country,â said Greenblatt. âData drives policy, and without having a complete understanding of the problem, we cannot effectively address this significant surge in hate violence.â

ADL calls on Congress to pass the Improved Reporting to Prevent Hate Act, which would require law enforcement agencies to credibly report hate crimes to the FBI to be eligible for certain federal funding. In addition, ADL urges Congress to pass the Countering Antisemitism Act, which would ensure that the policies and infrastructure of the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism are made permanent.","[1, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/adl-onetable-and-passages-israel-launch-light-city,"September 20, 2024 â As antisemitism reaches unprecedented levels in the United States, ADL (Anti-Defamation League), OneTable, and Passages Israel are working to build bridges between the Jewish and Christian communities through shared experiences and dialogue. Their joint initiative, âA Light in the City,â aims to foster friendship and understanding by hosting Shabbat dinners in four key cities.

Â 

The pilot program, to take place in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York City, and Washington D.C. in the fall, is meant to convene young Jewish and Christian professionals in their 20s and 30s for intimate Shabbat dinners. These gatherings, spearheaded by a young leader from each community, will serve as a platform for building relationships, sparking meaningful conversations, and fostering partnerships within each community.Â 
Â 
Leaders from ADL, OneTable, and Passages Israel expressed their sentiments:Â Â 
Â 
From Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO, ADL:Â 
âIn these challenging times, it's crucial that we come together to foster understanding and build lasting connections. This initiative between ADL and Passages Israel, with support from OneTable, is a testament to our commitment to combating hate and promoting mutual respect in our communities. In times of great division, we here at ADL respond with unity, fostering connections and understanding through initiatives like âA Light in the City.â By bringing together Jewish and Christian communities, we are committed to combating hate and building bridges.â

Â 

From Rivka Kidron, Co-Founder of Passages Israel:Â 

âThe more the Jewish and Christian communities come together, the more we can deepen our understanding of each otherâs unique challenges and also strengthen our collective resolve. The Jewish People face grave current challenges, and many in the Christian community want to stand shoulder to shoulder with their Jewish colleagues and the State of Israel during this time of heightened threats. This initiative is a timely opportunity to engage and create greater understanding and relationships between our communities, with the common goal of fostering solidarity, unity and commonality of purpose against those who spread hate, division and antisemitism.â

Â 

From Aliza Kline, CEO, OneTableÂ 
âShabbat dinner is an ideal time for people to come together, break bread, and experience â first hand â Jewish wisdom and joy. Since Oct. 7, more than 80,000 young people have participated in OneTable Shabbat dinners and a growing number of them are intentionally including peers who are not Jewish. Itâs a beautiful thing to open up Shabbat dinners to guests who are not Jewish in order to share Jewish connection and joy with them.âÂ 

Â 

The Shabbat dinners will be held in the homes of ADL young professionals or other appropriate venues, with each event hosting a maximum of 10-15 attendees to ensure a personal and engaging experience.Â 

Â 

To encourage organic, meaningful conversations between attendees, ADL and Passages Israel are working with OneTable to develop a table talk resource. We are hopeful that this interfaith Shabbat guide â specifically designed for Jews and Christians â will serve as a model for other interfaith programs. Discussions will be led by ADL hosts, their Passages Israel counterpart, Passages Israel alumni and other young Jewish professionals. Conversations will address current challenges faced by their communities and explore ways to support one another in a post-October 7 world.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-joins-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-against-intel,"New York, NY, September 19, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced it is joiningÂ Wigdor LLP as co-counsel in an employment discrimination lawsuit against Intel, marking the first time in recent history the anti-hate organization has filed suit against a major Fortune 500 company for alleged antisemitic discrimination in the workplace.

TheÂ complaint in John Doe v. Intel CorporationÂ alleges that Intel failed to address a hostile work environment, discriminated against the plaintiff because of his national origin, religion, race and ethnicity, and ultimately retaliated against him for reporting the discrimination.

The plaintiff â an Israeli living and working in New York â was assigned to report to an Intel executive who bullied and undermined him, as well as publicly amplified social media messages celebrating the murder of Israelis. When the plaintiff, who had outstanding performance reviews and had recently been promoted, reported the anti-Israel hostility and discriminatory workplace conduct, Intel removed him from his job and forced him into a lower-paying role.

âWe cannot allow antisemitism to threaten the livelihoods of workers and their families,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âIntel failed to protect a talented Israeli employee from workplace discrimination, instead punishing him for raising concerns about his hostile anti-Israel manager. ADL is committed to holding Intel accountable for this injustice and reminding all businesses that such bigotry is unacceptable.â

This announcement comes on the heels of Intelâs opposition to the plaintiffâs request to remain unnamed in public court documents â a decision that will risk the safety of the plaintiff and his family.

Antisemitism in the workplace mirrors dramatic increases of antisemitism in society. ADLâs annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents counted a total of 8,873Â antisemitic incidents in 2023,Â aÂ 140-percent increaseÂ from 2022 â already a record-setting year â and the highest level recorded since ADL started tracking this data in 1979. Antisemitic attitudes are also at record levels, with 24 percent of Americans harboring extensive antisemitic beliefs, an increase from 20 percent in 2022.

âWe are thrilled that ADL has decided to join us in prosecuting this important case against Intel,â said Douglas H. Wigdor, Founding Partner, Wigdor LLP.Â âWe share ADLâs mission in fighting antisemitism and look forward to working with them in sending a clear message to corporate America that defamation of the Jewish people will not be tolerated in the workplace.â

The complaint, which was originally filed on August 13, 2024, in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, urges the Court to rule that Intelâs actions violated the law, and to order Intel to permanently halt such unlawful conduct. The complaint also urges the Court to award damages to compensate the Plaintiff for harm suffered as a direct result of Intelâs unlawful and discriminatory conduct, as well as punitive damages.

This lawsuit builds on ADLâs efforts to combat workplace antisemitism. More than 100 major corporations have signed on to the ADL âWorkplace Pledge to Fight Antisemitism,â committing toÂ address antisemitism in Diversity, Equity, and InclusionÂ programs, support Jewish employees throughÂ Employee Resource GroupsÂ or other means, provideÂ religious accommodationsÂ for employees, and speak out against antisemitism. AsÂ partÂ of the White Houseâs National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, every Fortune 500 company received ADL information on antisemitism, religious accommodations, and Jewish culture and contributions.

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact. A global leader in combating antisemitism, countering extremism and battling bigotry wherever and whenever it happens, ADL works to protect democracy and ensure a just and inclusive society for all.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.8}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/largest-100-university-endowments-could-lose-33-billion-over-10-years-if,"New York, NY, September 19, 2024Â â¦ Adopting anÂ Israel divestmentÂ strategy aligned with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement could lead to significant negative financial implications for university endowments, finds a report released today by JLens, the leading Jewish values-based investor network, part of the ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) family.Â 

The report, the first of its kind to thoroughly quantify these risks, analyzed the historical performance of two hypothetical large-cap U.S. equity portfolios: one broadly diversified without restrictions and another excluding companies targeted by BDS campaigns such as Alphabet, Amazon, Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin and Microsoft. Due to the effect of compounding interest, the 1.8 percent performance gap between the two portfolios (an annualized return difference of 11.1 percent compared to 12.9 percent) translates to substantial differences in returns over time.

The full report includes detailed forecasts for the 100 largest university endowments, if the universities were to invest based on BDS-aligned divestment strategies from 2023 to 2033. For example, Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Princeton are projected to collectively lose more than $8 billion in estimated returns on their endowments over the decade. Brown University, which is actively considering demands for Israel divestment, could miss out on an estimated $309,787,060 in returns on its $6 billion endowment.

These 100 largest U.S. university endowments could collectively forgo $33.2 billion in returns over the next decade if they adopt BDS-aligned investment strategies.Â 

âCalls for universities to divest from companies doing business in Israel are not only morally dangerous, but may also be financially dangerous,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âUniversity investment committees have a fiduciary responsibility to prudently steward institutional resources.â

âOur research demonstrates that university endowments that divest from Israel could face significant financial consequences,â said Ari Hoffnung, JLens Managing Director and ADL Senior Advisor on Corporate Advocacy. âLower investment returns could compromise a universityâs ability to provide scholarships, fund research, and invest in campus facilities.â

âThis groundbreaking report approaches the morally problematic BDS movement from an entirely new direction - its negative impact on portfolio returns,â said Michael Lustig, Adjunct Professor of Finance at the New York University Stern School of Business and Managing Partner, i4:assemblÃ©. âJLens has done a great job in quantifying the financial effects of implementing the suggestions of this pernicious movement, and importantly, they âshow their workâ by providing full transparency into their methodology, and properly caveat the points where assumptions must necessarily be made. This report will prove to be an important tool in helping to fight noxious BDS advocacy.âÂ 

TheÂ Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement seeks to isolate Israel on multiple fronts: diplomatic, financial, professional, academic and cultural. ADL believes that the movementâs ultimate goal is to delegitimize and pressure Israel, its institutions, and its supporters, including Jewish individuals and community organizations. On campuses, BDS campaigns typically target university endowments, urging divestment from multinational corporations which conduct business in Israel or are accused of supporting Israelâs actions in the West Bank and Gaza. While some BDS campaigns frame demands within broader human rights concerns, they often focus on undermining Israelâs legitimacy.Â 

In 2022,Â ADL incorporated JLens to expand its participation in the responsible investing and shareholder advocacy fields, and to fight efforts by some activists to push for anti-Israel and antisemitic policies in these fields. JLens, a non-profit organization, empowers investors to align their capital with Jewish values and advocates for Jewish communal priorities in the corporate arena.Â

ADL-MVRF research and related publications will now be published and available throughÂ Mauraâs Voice Research Fund and its website.

The research being performed is driving new insights into the behavior of misogynistic violent extremists to support more advanced research, raise public awareness, promote development of effective preventive policy, and through its investigative component, help facilitate intervention to stop planned acts of violence.

âRenewing ADLâs partnership with Mauraâs Voice Research Fund to pursue collaborative research in the field of violent misogynistic extremism is a crucial step in our organizationâs mission to research, track and prevent all forms of extremism and hate,â said Oren Segal, VP of the ADL Center on Extremism. âSimilarly to other partnerships ADL has established and strengthened throughout the years with specialized organizations, it will allow us to deepen our knowledge of misogynistic extremism and to benefit from both organizationâs expertise and resources to combat it at a time when expressions of hate and violence are surging.â

âMy daughter Maura, then a 21-year-old senior at Florida State University, lost her life in a shooting at a Tallahassee Hot Yoga Studio in 2018. This attack also took the life of FSU Medical School Professor Dr. Nancy Van Vessem and wounded four other women. The perpetrator was a member of the hateful, extremist element of the incel subculture and targeted the victims for no other reason than being women. This was a crime of hate. Period,â said Jeff Binkley, Mauraâs father, and co-founder (along with Mauraâs late mother, Margret) of MVRF. âWe must realize that beyond the tragic and often preventable loss of innocent victimsâ lives and the trauma and shattered dreams suffered by survivorsâ¦a hate crime against any one of us is a crime against all of us. Crimes committed by the hands of hate undermine the basic values of a free society.â

Since its launch in 2019 the Mauraâs Voice Research Fund has dedicated its efforts to counter extremist and violent misogyny and prevent violence against women and girls.

âOur partnership with the ADL, the oldest and most respected organization dedicated to countering hate, has advanced our ability to perform leading-edge research that not only produces new insights and information, but leads to action in effectively countering hatred and violence against women and girls,â said Dr. David Springer, Dean of the FSU College ofÂ Social Work. âFlorida State University and Mauraâs Voice Research Fund are honored to work with ADL in this important endeavor.â

About Mauraâs Voice

The Maura's Voice Research Fund was established by Maura's parents, Jeff and Margaret Binkley, in memory of their daughter Maura Binkley, a young woman who dedicated her life to serving others. Maura was a senior at FSU who planned to continue the course of her generous life by participating after graduation in the Fulbright Scholarship program.Â Maura's Voice Research Fund (Maura's Voice) serves to realize the vision of deepening the scientific understanding of and effective responses to hate fueled violence, and particularly violence against women and girls. Maura's Voice champions a unique and robust focus on researching and responding to the complex causes and effects of hatred and violent extremism. The Fund will develop knowledge for and test innovative approaches to forensic evaluation, management, treatment, and prevention strategies, as well as for sound policy development and implementation.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adls-task-force-middle-east-minorities-endorses-united-states-commitment,"New York, NY. September 17, 2024 ... The ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) Task Force on Middle East Minorities applauds the introduction and urges the swift passage ofÂ House Resolution 554Â affirming the nature and importance of the support of the United States for the religious and ethnic minority survivors of genocide in Iraq.

The resolution reaffirms the unwavering support of the U.S. government for the survivors of genocide among Iraqâs religious and ethnic minority communities. These communitiesâcomprising Yezidis, Turkmen, Shabak, Sabaean-Mandeans, Kakaâi, and indigenous Christians (including Chaldean, Syriac, Assyrian, Armenian, and Melkite groups)âhave been vital to the cultural and historical landscape of Iraq and the broader Middle East for centuries.

Tragically, these communities were subjected to severe atrocities by ISIS, including murder, forced conversion, human trafficking, and the destruction of cultural heritage. The U.S. Secretary of State has formally recognized these acts as genocide and crimes against humanity.

The resolution presents a comprehensive list of priorities including upholding human rights; restoration and return of displaced communities, supplied with rebuilding efforts; ensuring effective political representation; and encouraging greater regional integration and administrative autonomy for minority groups within Iraqâs federal framework.

Reflecting on the historical exodus of the Jewish population from Iraq in 1950s, which wiped out an entire community, and how that represented a significant loss for the rich cultural and historical tapestry of Iraq, ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities urges swift passage of House Resolution 554 which would enable the survival of Yezidis, Turkmen, Shabak, Sabaean-Mandeans, Kakaâi, and indigenous Christians in their native lands.

In 2018, ADLâs Task Force on Middle East MinoritiesÂ supported the passing of the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act (H.R.390), which underscores the commitment of the U.S. in directing humanitarian aid to those most in need, especially those targeted by ISIS. The Task Force support for H.R. 554 follows our endorsement of H.R. 390.

Shadi Martini, co-chair of ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities and Chief Executive Director of Multifaith Alliance stated: âAs a person who worked directly with ethnic Minorities in Iraq, I know how important the passing of House Resolution 554 is for the minority communities who have been targeted specifically in recent years. I urge Congress to pass the legislation and for the president to sign it into law.â

Nadine Maenza, ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities member and President at IRF Secretariat further added that ""Congress should pass House Resolution 554, urging the U.S. and international community to make upholding the human rights and dignity of religious and ethnic minorities a priority in their Iraq policy. This includes pushing for fair representation in parliament and local governments, appropriate budget allocation by the Iraq Government, continued support by international aid donors, and the safe, dignified, and voluntary return of the displaced.""","[3, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.8, 4: 0.0, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/significant-increase-campus-anti-israel-activity-marked-support-terror-and,"New York, NY, September 16, 2024, â¦ A total of 2,087 anti-Israel incidentsÂ of assault, vandalism, harassment, protests/actions and divestment resolutions were recorded on college and university campuses in the United States between June 1, 2023, and May 31, 2024. This represents a 477 percent increase in those same categories compared to the prior school year, according to a new ADL (Anti-Defamation League) report released today.Â Â 

The annual campus report from the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) identified a record number of anti-Israel incidents, including 28 assaults. No assaults were recorded in 2022-2023 and only one in 2021-2022. ADL also recorded 1,418 protests and actions (including encampments), 360 instances of targeted verbal or written harassment, 201 instances of vandalism, and 80 BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) resolutions (71 that passed and 9 that were voted down). Some of the incidents counted in this report also referenced classic antisemitic tropes like purported Jewish wealth, greed and control over political affairs.Â 

The newly released ADL report also identifies common rhetorical themes such as overt expressions of support for terrorism and violence.Â This includes the veneration of theÂ Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),Â Hamas,Â Hezbollah andÂ the Houthis (Ansar Allah); misinformation and disinformation about October 7; removal of hostage fliers and disrupting events memorializing October 7.

âThe antisemitic, anti-Zionist vitriol weâve witnessed on campus is unlike anything weâve seen in the past,â said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âSince the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, the anti-Israel movementâs relentless harassment, vandalism, intimidations and violent physical assaults go way beyond the peaceful voicing of a political opinion. Administrators and faculty need to do much better this year to ensure a safe and truly inclusive environment for all students, regardless of religion, nationality, or political views, and they need to start now.â

Centers for Jewish life on campus were oftenÂ targeted by anti-Israel activity over the course of the year; There were at least 73 incidents that directly impacted Hillels and Chabads. Hillels and Chabads were subject toÂ numerous demands from activists, including calls for their schools to cut ties with both organizations. Protests outside the properties of these organizations and the events they hosted occurred on several campuses.Â 

âThe surge in incidents of all kinds has dramatically altered Campus life for Jewish students across the United States,â said Oren Segal, Vice President of the ADL Center on Extremism. âEscalation tactics, which increasingly normalize the narratives of terror groups and directly target Jewish communities on campus, must be countered with institutional efforts to protect students.â

Key findings include:

Campus groups responsible for much of the recorded anti-Israel activity in this report includeÂ Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP),Â Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and Dissenters.
Anti-Israel incidents impacted over 360 campuses across 46 states and the District of Columbia.Â The top 10 campuses with the highest number of reported incidents are Columbia University (52), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (38), Harvard University (36), University of California, Berkeley (36), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) (35), Rutgers University, New Brunswick (33), Stanford University (30), Cornell University (27), University of Washington (26) and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (25). Collectively, these institutions represent 16% of the total incidents.
Students received support from off-campus organizations connected to the broader Palestine solidarity movement, such asÂ American Muslims for Palestine (AMP),Â Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Palestine Legal. They provide funding, trainings, legal assistance and other kinds of support. Independent donors and foundations also supported campus anti-Israel groups, including Resist, Inc, and the Emergent Fund.Â 

Policy Recommendations

Administrators must respond immediately to conduct that deprives students of equal access to educational opportunities in violation of Title VI.

University leaders must ensure that students and faculty are aware of their campusesâ codes of conduct, including policies and procedures for managing protests, demonstrations, postings and other speech activity.
Universities must ensure free and full access to all campus buildings, spaces, events, and activities, both in policy and in effect.
Colleges and universities must make clear that calling for schools to sever ties with Hillel and Chabad are antisemitic demands, antithetical to the institutionâs values and will not be accommodated or considered.
Colleges and universities must reaffirm their opposition to the BDS movement and explain to the campus community why that movement is harmful and antithetical to campus values and the principle of academic freedom.

Additionally, ADL is urging Congress to pass the following federal measures to protect Jewish students and fight the scourge of antisemitism:Â the Countering Antisemitism Act; the Antisemitism Awareness Act and the Protecting Students on Campus Act.

Finally, ADLÂ strongly urges all states to develop and implement comprehensive, state-specific strategies to counter antisemitism, with a special focus on protecting Jewish students on college and university campuses. This includes convening university leaders to discuss campus safety and issue guidance reaffirming the limits of First Amendment protection for expressive activity and how campus rules, standards, policies, and faculty responsibilities must be enforced to ensure campus safety and support Jewish students and faculty.Â 

Methodology

ADL researchers gathered incidents primarily using open-source research methods. Much of the data was compiled by monitoring publicly available information posted online. Other information came from incidents reported to ADL by students and faculty, and by reviewing student newspapers and other news media. Important insights were also gleaned from the work of other organizations, including the Israel on Campus Coalition (ICC), Hillel International and AMCHA Initiative. In cases where ADL obtained information from the media or from third parties, researchers always sought out primary sources to substantiate the reporting.Â 

The report does not distinguish between antisemitic anti-Israel incidents and general anti-Israel incidents (more information about antisemitic incidents specifically can be found in the annualÂ ADL Audit of Antisemitic Incidents). Some incidents crossed the line from extreme anti-Israel rhetoric into antisemitism, though others did not.

Unlike reports in previous years, ADL did not tabulate the number of incidents involving sign-on statements, letters, petitions or general anti-Israel events like panels and webinars. The volume of these incidents was so high, their tabulation was removed from the scope of the report for practical reasons.

Due to the nature of incident reporting and data collection, incidents in this report are inherently undercounted.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/murder-dallas-police-officer-marks-latest-string-violent-sovereign-citizen,"The murder of a police officer in Dallas last month by a suspected adherent of the sovereign citizen movement became the latest in an alarming rise of violent incidents this year involving individuals who subscribe to the extreme right-wing, anti-government ideology and law enforcement officials.

In fact, 2024 has been a record year for violent encounters between police and sovereign citizens. In the space of just six months between March and August 2024, sovereign citizens opened fire on police officers in five separate incidents, while in a sixth incident, police had to shoot an armed sovereign citizen after he tried to break his way into an airport and threatened them.

The latest confrontation occurred on the evening of August 29, 2024, as Dallas police officer Darron Burks was sitting in his police cruiser, waiting for his next call. He was approached by a man later identified as Corey Cobb-Bey, 30, who had parked his own vehicle nearby. After a brief discussion, Cobb-Bey suddenlyÂ pulled out a pistol and shot Burks at point-blank range in his patrol car, killing him.

Cobb-Bey then armed himself with a shotgun from his vehicle and waited for police to respond to the shooting. When additional officers arrived at the scene, Cobb-Bey fired on them as well, wounding two more officers, one critically, before finally fleeing in his vehicle with police in pursuit. After a chase of 20 miles, Cobb-Bey finally stopped.Â  As law enforcement officers exited their vehicles, Cobb-Bey emerged from his own vehicle carrying his shotgun, which he pointed at the police. Multiple officers fired at Cobb-Bey, killing him. Dallas police subsequentlyÂ characterized the killing of Burks as an âambushâ and an âexecution.â

An investigation of the killer by the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) revealed that Cobb-Bey had made filings and numerous online posts indicating his adherence to the anti-government extremistÂ sovereign citizen movement, as well as to the religious sect Moorish Science Temple, which hasÂ considerable overlap with sovereign citizens.

The exact motive for Cobb-Beyâs murder of Officer Burks is unclear, but theÂ extreme anti-government beliefs of the sovereign citizen movement can greatly heighten any antagonism adherents may have for law enforcement.

Since 2020, the sovereign citizen movement has enjoyed aÂ significant surge of popularity, capitalizing on opposition to government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak and on success in recruiting from among the more fanatic MAGA supporters and from the conspiracy movement QAnon, as well as its ability to use social media to spread its anti-government message.Â The chances that law enforcement officers might unexpectedly encounter a potentially violent sovereign citizen in the course of their duties has correspondingly grown as well.

Notably, five of the six incidents this year took place in Florida or Texas, two populous states with a large and longstanding sovereign citizen presence.

In addition to the Dallas shooting, the five other incidents so far in 2024 included the following:

Melbourne, Florida, June 28, 2024: A sovereign citizen, John Jay Niebuhr,Â attempted to drive his vehicle through a secure gate on the perimeter of the Melbourne Orlando International Airport. Police reported that when responding officers made contact with Niebuhr, the sovereign â who was armed â threatened the officers with a weapon, prompting them to fire at him, mortally wounding him. Prior to this incident, the Palm Bay Police Department had distributed a âsituational awareness bulletinâ about Niebuhr to its officers that described his previous encounters with police and his claim to be a sovereign citizen.
Hamilton County, Florida, May 15, 2024:Â During an armed standoff,Â self-described sovereign citizen Joseph A. Ogle opened fire on deputies from three sheriffâs departments attempting to serve an arrest warrant on him at his home on charges related to alleged violent threats. According to law enforcement, Ogle refused to exit his home andÂ eventually started firing at deputies and their vehicles. Ogle did eventually leave his home, carrying a handgun, at which point he was fatally shot by a SWAT team member from Alachua County.
Lakeland, Florida, April 27, 2024: Kyran Caples,Â also known as Kmac El Bey,Â opened fire on deputies who encountered him parked in his car at night in a closed city park.Â According to police, Caples refused to engage or cooperate with the initial deputy who encountered him. More deputies arrived after the first one called for backup; together, they tried to remove Caples from the vehicle. Caples allegedly pulled out a gun and fired at the deputies, wounding two of them, one critically.Â  The deputies killed Caples in return fire. Police say Caples was a sovereign citizen and had several guns in his vehicle at the time of the encounter.Â 
Harris County, Texas, April 14, 2024: During a routine traffic stop, Harris County sheriffâs deputies encountered Patrick Hurst,Â a self-declared sovereign citizen. Hurst refused to cooperate with the traffic stop, ignoring requests to leave the vehicle.Â  After an hour, Hurstâwho already had a felony warrant for evading policeâsimply drove off, with the deputies in pursuit. Shortly thereafter, a deputy performed a PIT maneuver to stop Hurstâs car, upon which Hurst exited with a firearm and fired at deputies on the scene. Deputies returned fire, killing him. One of the bullets fired in the firefight wounded a bystander getting groceries.
Memphis, Tennessee, March 8, 2024:Â Self-described sovereign citizen Geronimo Kee allegedlyÂ opened fire on a Memphis police officer during a traffic stop. The officer, who was wounded in the encounter but survived, had pulled Kee over for speeding. According to law enforcement, Kee was uncooperative and refused to sign the citation â as is typical for sovereign citizens. After spending considerable time trying to persuade Kee, the officer broke the driverâs window to open the door, at which point Kee fired at the officer, hitting him several times. Kee fled the scene in his vehicle, later abandoning it, but was soon tracked down and arrested, charged with attempted first-degree murder, employing a firearm during a dangerous felony, intentionally evading arrest in a vehicle and speeding. During his first court appearance, Kee made the common sovereign citizen claim that the court had no jurisdiction over him because it was an admiralty or maritime court.

According to COE statistics, there have been at least 31 incidents in the U.S. over the past 15 years (2010-2024) in which sovereign citizens have shot at law enforcement officers or law enforcement officers have had to shoot at sovereigns who posed some sort of threat.

The six incidents that occurred in 2024 doubled the previous yearly high of three â and 2024 still has four months to go before it is over.

These statistics illustrate both the considerable threat of violence that sovereign citizens pose to law enforcement as well as the growth of the movement itself in recent years.",[],"{1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.5, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.5}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/nicole-mutchnik-named-adls-national-board-chair-elect,"New York, NY, September 12, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced the election of Nicole Mutchnik as chair-elect of ADLâs Board of Directors.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/slippery-slope-divestment-campaigns,"Letâs say that a university decides to acquiesce to the demands of anti-Israel protestors and divest its endowment from companies with business ties to Israel.Â 
Â 

Itâs a plausible scenario, despite the many political, economic, and legal reasons to reject the idea: its unfair singling-out and demonization of Israel; the likelihood of reduced endowment returns and lower donations from alumni; state measures discouraging boycotts of Israel; and potential legal risk from skirting fiduciary responsibilities, just to name a few.Â 
Â 

Nevertheless, some universities, including Brown, UC Riverside, The New School, and Johns Hopkins have agreed to consider and vote on measures to divest their endowments from Israel. Itâs certainly possible that others will follow suit.
Â 

However, any school that goes this route can easily find that itâs a slippery slope.Â 
Â 

Certainly, no country is above critique, including Israel, just as no individual, company, or industry is perfect. But allowing political pressures to influence investment decisions for university endowments in the case of Israel invites similar pressure campaigns focused on any number of issues, and a wider array of investment vehicles, not just direct holdings.Â 
Â 

Potentially Widening Divestment Targets
Â 

Activists could demand divestment from a much wider range of companies, such as fast-food corporations that contribute to obesity through unhealthy products, technology firms accused of privacy violations or spreading misinformation, or clothing retailers that source from factories with substandard labor practices. Adopting divestment as a primary tool to address corporate imperfections risks leaving the endowment's equity portfolio with a significantly limited number of stocks, adversely impacting diversification, returns, and the institution's ability to support its goals.
Â 

Instead of full divestment, a university may decide to appease protestorsâ demands in a way that would minimize impact on endowment returns: by divesting from Israel only its relatively minor direct holdings, rather than mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For example, only 4% of Brownâs endowment is directly invested, with 96% managed externally. However, this too is a slippery slope, since divesting from direct holdings will likely only satisfy activists temporarily.Â 
Â 

In fact, many divestment campaigns call for a review of ""pooled investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and ETFsâ for divestment. Any limited form of divestment is unlikely to appease activists for long and will inevitably lead to escalating demands.


Gary Sernowitz, managing director of Lime Rock Management, a private equity firm, argued in a New York Times essay that while endowments should not pursue returns at any cost they âcanât be in the moral adjudication business.âÂ 
Â 

âColleges should debate deep moral issues and discuss the hard compromises to solve the worldâs ills,â Sernowitz wrote. âBut we should move those efforts to the lecture halls, away from the investment offices.â
Â 

In addition to this suggestion to restrict political debate to academic settings, there is at least one other alternative to acquiescing to divestment demands. Universities and their endowment managers can engage as active shareholders to promote positive change at the companies in which they invest. That would allow them to represent the values and pursue the social ends to which they are committed while protecting their endowments from the slippery slope of successive divestment campaigns.Â Â Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/summer-hate-white-supremacist-activity-memorial-labor-day,"From Memorial Day through Labor Day 2024, the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) tracked a sustained, high level of white supremacist activity that included paramilitary-style marches, demonstrations, âfight nights,â propaganda drives, and disruption of public forums across the country.

COE documentedÂ 64 white supremacist events across 25 states between May 27 and September 2, 2024. A majority of these events were small, with just five to 12 participants, but there were also larger gatherings including one demonstration of roughly 200 participants.

In 2024 and throughout the summer, white supremacists also continued to distribute propaganda material in the form of banners, fliers, graffiti and stickers. This propaganda was primarily antisemitic, anti-Zionist and anti-immigrant, with a spike in anti-LGBTQ+ activity and messaging during Pride month in June.

These activity patterns demonstrate how white supremacists continue to opportunistically exploit current issues to raise their visibility, whether by inserting themselves into the anti-immigration debate in the lead-up to the 2024 election, targeting the LGBTQ+ community during Pride month, or adopting anti-Zionist messaging in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza following the October 7 attack.

Such efforts allow the white supremacist movement to further its goals; recruit new members, fundraise, harass and intimidate minority communities and normalize racist, antisemitic, anti-immigrant, and anti-LGBTQ+ hate.

The following is a glimpse into some of the activities and rhetoric over the past few months.

Demonstrations, Marches, and Fights

Patriot Front held more public demonstrations over the summer than any other white supremacist group. Summer has been a particularly active time for Patriot Front since it often chooses significant American holidays like Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and Labor Day to hold larger demonstrations for higher visibility. Patriot Frontâs Independence Day march, held in downtown Nashville, drew approximately 200 participants and was the largest white supremacist event of the summer.

The group also held several medium-size flash demonstrations over the Memorial Day and Labor Day holiday weekends, including in Texas, Washington, Colorado, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. Many of these demonstrations took place at cemeteries or memorials with a connection to American history, such as the Gettysburg National Military Park.

Over the Labor Day holiday weekend, approximately 30 individuals associated with Patriot Front held a demonstration in downtown Tallahassee, FL.

The neo-Nazi groupÂ Blood Tribe also held several events this summer wearing their now-signature black ski masks and red outfits, carrying swastika flags and sometimes even firearms during militant marches through Pierre, South Dakota; Springfield, Ohio; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

During the June march in Pierre,Â Chris Pohlhaus, the groupâs leader, stated that they were there to protest South Dakotaâs HB 1076, a state bill signed into law in March that includes a definition of antisemitism in investigations of unfair or discriminatory practices.

White supremacist groups also continued to hostÂ collaborative fight nights and MMA-style events over the summer. These events attracted a range of white supremacist groups from across the United States and allowed them to fraternize, recruit and fundraise.

The largest fighting events occurred in August. Over the weekend of August 9, individuals affiliated with Patriot Front andÂ the Active Club network took part in a Jiu-Jitsu tournament organized by âDevotion Jiu-Jitsu,â a Virginia-based gym closely connected to the white supremacist group Wolves of Vinland (WoV). Later in the month, on August 24, SoCal Active Club, a southern California-based white supremacist group, organized its third annual âFrontierâ fight night in Hemet, California. The event attracted approximately 50 white supremacists, including members of Patriot Front and regional Active Clubs from Massachusetts, Idaho, Michigan, Wyoming, Texas and Arizona. Individuals affiliated with theÂ Western Hammerskins, a historically violent neo-Nazi skinhead group, were also in attendance.

Antisemitic Activity

Over the summer, white supremacists distributed antisemitic propaganda and held events that targeted the Jewish community.

From July 13 - 21, approximately two dozen individuals associated with the antisemiticÂ Goyim Defense League (GDL) gathered in Nashville, Tennessee, to participate in the networkâs âName the Noseâ tour, its sixth since launching the event in 2019. Participants included individuals from Florida, Georgia, Colorado, California, Oklahoma, Missouri, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Texas and even drew some from Canada. The group engaged in antisemitic trolling tactics including overpass banner drops, propaganda distributions and demonstrations that displayed antisemitic banners and swastika flags.

During the tour, the group also disrupted a city council meeting, protested outside a synagogue and disrupted âNashville Together,â a Jewish solidarity event.

Â 

In both July and August, GDL associate Shane Powell organized âFlyerCaustâ events in California during which he and several other individuals associated with the GDL andÂ Clockwork Crew livestreamed overpass demonstrations and the distribution of thousands of antisemitic fliers in the surrounding cities of the greater San Francisco area from Petaluma to Berkeley Hills.

Patriot Front, which has been responsible for the vast majority of white supremacist propaganda distributions since 2018, continued its use of the antisemitic message âNo Zionists in government, we serve one Nationâ in banners and fliers.

Individuals associated with various white supremacist networks also distributed some of the anti-Zionist propaganda and messaging seen since the October 7 attack, as well as antisemitic tropes. Some of their material read: âNo more wars for Israel, End Jewish terror,â âResist Zionism,â âAnti-Zionist action,â âBoycott Jewish businesses,â âBoycott Israeli businessâ and âJews & The AIPAC Lobby Control Congress & The Senate, Wake Up.""

Anti-Immigration Activity

Since late May 2024, COE tracked an increased focus on anti-immigrant themes in white supremacist propaganda and rhetoric. Opposition to non-white immigration is core to white supremacist ideology and extremists rush to exploit the ongoing immigration crisis.

White supremacists held demonstrations at locations where these groups allege immigrants are being housed or in cities perceived as welcoming to them.

On June 2, individuals associated with the Atlantic Nationalist Club, a small white supremacist group primarily based in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York, demonstrated outside a Farmingdale, New York Motor Inn claiming immigrants were being held there. The group held a banner that read, âNo migrants in N.Y.â A few weeks later, on June 15, individuals associated with a Washington-based chapter of white supremacist White Lives Matter (WLM) network held an anti-immigrant demonstration outside a refugee encampment in Kent, Washington. Members held a large sign that read: âAuslÃ¤nder Raus!â, a German phrase meaning âforeigners out.â

In August, Blood Tribe turned its focus on the Haitian immigrant population in Springfield, Ohio, and encouraged other white supremacist groups to do the same. On August 10, twelve Blood Tribe members marched through the city, with several participants waving swastika flags while others carried AR-style rifles and knives. During a stop in front of City Hall, Blood Tribe Ohio leader Drake Berentz gave a speech complaining about ânon-white immigrantsâ in the United States.

Â 

Â 

Berentz and four other Blood Tribe members returned on August 27 to attend the Springfield City Commission meeting. During the public comment portion of the meeting, Berentz, griped about the cityâs immigrant population, speaking for less than two minutes before being escorted out of the building by police officers.

On September 1, approximately two dozen individuals associated with Patriot Front followed Blood Tribeâs lead and held an anti-immigration rally outside Springfield City Hall displaying a banner that read, âAmerican spirit, European blood.â

Blood Tribeâs final march of the summer also focused on immigration. On August 24, approximately two dozen members of Blood Tribe marched through Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, waving swastika flags and shouting the âSieg Heil!â while engaging in verbal and physical altercations with pedestrians. The march ended on the state capitolâs steps where brief speeches were given that attributed high crime rates to the ânon-whiteâ and immigrant population of the city.","[1, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.6, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/impact-divestment-campaigns-rising-antisemitism,"Campus activism surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict often presents a skewed narrative, painting Israel as the sole aggressor and magnifying its flaws beyond those of any other nation. While all countries have their shortcomings and deserve scrutiny, Israel stands out as a unique target of widespread university divestment campaigns, suggesting a disproportionate focus on its actions and policies.

Through their rhetoric and demands, anti-Israel divestment campaigns can feed into the demonization of Israel and mischaracterization of Zionism, the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland. The measures for which Israel-divestment activists advocate are one-sided and unconstructive, and they fail to promote a better future for Palestinians and Israelis.
Â 

Anti-Zionism and BDS

Â 

Listen to the slogans and demands of anti-Israel activists, and their beliefs about Israel and Zionism become clear. Divestment campaigns intend to delegitimize Israel's right to exist and unfairly attempt to hold Israel to a different standard than any other country, including the United States. And yet they fail to condemn the worldâs worst sponsors of terror and abusers of human rights.


The movement places the entire onus for the complicated Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Israel alone, and does not support constructive measures to build Israeli-Palestinian engagement or a mutually negotiated two-state solution to the conflict. Indeed, the movement for divestment doesnât seek a two-state solution; it aims to dismantle the Jewish state.Â 


Israel-divestment activism is the latest iteration of the wider Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement that has attempted for years to marginalize and delegitimize Israel. BDS opposes the fundamental building blocks for Israeli-Palestinian understanding, peace-building, and ultimate reconciliation, even at the grassroots level.Â 


ADL believes that many of the founding goals of the BDS movement are antisemitic, given that they effectively reject or ignore the Jewish peopleâs right of self-determination â and if implemented, would result in the eradication of the worldâs only Jewish state. And some BDS advocates and campaigns engage in antisemitic rhetoric.Â 

BDS campaigns can create tensions in communities, particularly on college campuses, potentially leading to the isolation and intimidation of Jewish students and supporters of Israel. The movementâs regressive policy of âanti-normalizationâ forbids people-to-people exchanges, dialogue opportunities for Israelis and Palestinians, or even interactions between âpro-Israelâ and âpro-Palestineâ groups and advocates. This applies even to Israeli/pro-Israel groups who support a Gaza ceasefire and are strong advocates for Palestinian rights unless the parties involved first renounce Zionism and declare Israelis to be âoppressorsâ and âcolonizers.â

Rising AntisemitismÂ 

Â 

The demonization of Zionism and Zionists is particularly frightening and dangerous in this moment of significantly rising levels of antisemitism, and can contribute to conditions where Jews are targeted for their actual or perceived connection to Israel. And it is not just hypothetical: during the Fall semester (from October 7 to the end of 2023), ADL documented a 1,062 percent increase in antisemitic incidents on U.S. university campuses, compared to the same period in 2022.Â 

A U.S. News & World Report survey in April and May found that more than two-thirds of Jewish students at elite U.S. universities say antisemitism is a problem on their campus. Students from universities across the country articulated the plight of many Jewish university students at a House hearing in March. One student at Rutgers University stated âI didnât come to college to study in a living laboratory of antisemitism, which is what it has become,â adding âJews at Rutgers are afraid.â

Â 

Another student at University of California, Berkeley faced physical and verbal harassment, eventually missing class due to fear of violence. âWhen you do not call out hate against Jews based on shared ancestral identity, that sends the message to other students on campus that it is okay, socially acceptable, tolerated behavior to actively hate Jews on campus,â she said.

Â 

Effective ActivismÂ 

Â 

If campus activists were genuinely committed to uplifting the Palestinian people and helping bring lasting peace to the region, there are more productive avenues than pushing divestment from Israel. Activists could be advocating for their university endowments to become activist shareholders in the companies in which they invest, using their leverage to push those companies to make strategic investments in the Palestinian economy and in peacebuilding initiatives.Â 

But that is not what is happening. Anti-Israel activistsâ current approach seems focused on penalizing only one side in a complex, two-sided conflict, placing the entire burden on Israel to create the necessary conditions for peace. This one-sided strategy fails to acknowledge the roles and responsibilities of both parties in resolving the conflict and achieving lasting stability in the region.Â

Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO
Meta
1 Hacker Way
Menlo Park, CA 94025


Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,


We write to you as leaders of seven of the largest Jewish Diaspora communities representing over 90% of Jews globally outside of Israel. As Jews, our communities continue to feel the impact of the brutal Hamas attack of October 7, 2023, with its death toll of over 1200 Israelis, over 4000 wounded, and over 250 taken hostage, and over a hundred still held captive in Gaza. Our Jewish communities continue to bear the brunt of dramatic increases of antisemitism, with huge number of attacks on our community members, our students, our institutions, both on the streets and online. Alarmingly, the Oversight Board (OB) released its September 4, 2024 decision that the phrase âfrom the river to the seaâ is not hate. We are profoundly dismayed at the Oversight Boardâs decision, and we urge Meta to reject it and amend its hate policy to prohibit this phrase that effectively calls for the expulsion of half of the worldâs Jews.


We fear that acceptance of this decision would represent an indifference to online hate and harassment. Regrettably, this has been a pattern in Meta. From the decade it took Meta to realize that Holocaust denial is indeed hate, to your well-documented role in the Genocide of the Rohingya Muslim community, to the ongoing failure to address hate against the LGBTQ community that has led to severe offline harms, to your role in fomenting movements rooted in conspiracy theories like Qanon that ultimately lead to the January 6 insurrection against the United States government, Meta has sadly made itself a haven for radicalization and extreme ideologies in the pursuit of profit.


The phrase âfrom the river to the seaâ is hate speech. This rallying cry, enshrined in the charter of Hamas, has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas and the PFLP, which seek Israelâs destruction through violent means. It is fundamentally a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the entirety of the State of Israel, which would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state. It is an antisemitic charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination, including through the forced removal of Jews from their ancestral homeland. Indeed, the Arabic version of the slogan is âFrom the water to the water, Palestine will be Arabâ (min el-mayeh lil-mayeh, Filastin Arabiyeh), making the meaning crystal clear: there is no space for Jews.


Usage of this phrase has the effect of making members of the Jewish and pro-Israel community feel unsafe and ostracized. A recent study of the American campus environment from the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago (CPOST) found that â66% of Jewish college students understand the pro-Palestinian protest chant âFrom the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Freeâ to mean the expulsion and genocide of Israeli Jews.â


Understanding that âzero tolerance does not mean zero occurrence,â accepting the Oversight Boardâs decision on this case will clearly indicate Metaâs willingness to tolerate violent hate speech on its platform. Moreover, the focus on the intent of the speaker over the impact of the speech in this decision shows a callous disregard for the experience of marginalized communities.


As the leaders of communities representing the largest Diaspora Jewish populations, we call on Meta to recognize the harm this phrase poses to the Jewish community worldwide, reject the Oversight Boardâs short-sighted decision and urge it instead to take steps to address the ongoing issues with online hate and harassment that continue to proliferate across Metaâs many platforms.

We are profoundly dismayed at the Oversight Boardâs decision, and we urge Meta to reject it and amend its hate policy to prohibit this phrase that effectively calls for the expulsion of half of the worldâs Jews.

We fear that acceptance of this decision would represent an indifference to online hate and harassment.Â  Regrettably, this has been a pattern in Meta. From the decade it took Meta to realize that Holocaust denial is indeed hate, to your well-documented role in the Genocide of the Rohingya Muslim community, to the ongoing failure to address hate against the LGBTQ community that has led to severe offline harms, to your role in fomenting movements rooted in conspiracy theories like Qanon that ultimately lead to the January 6 insurrection against the United States government, Meta has sadly made itself a haven for radicalization and extreme ideologies in the pursuit of profit.

The phrase âfrom the river to the seaâ is hate speech.Â This rallying cry,Â enshrined in theÂ charter of Hamas, has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas and the PFLP, which seek Israelâs destruction through violent means. It is fundamentally a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the entirety of the State of Israel, which would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state. It is an antisemitic charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination, including through the forced removal of Jews from their ancestral homeland.Â  Indeed, the Arabic version of the slogan is âFrom the water to the water, Palestine will be Arabâ (min el-mayeh lil-mayeh, Filastin Arabiyeh), making the meaning crystal clear: there is no space for Jews.Â 

Usage of this phrase has the effect of making members of the Jewish and pro-Israel community feel unsafe and ostracized. AÂ recent study of the American campus environment from the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago (CPOST) found that â66% of Jewish college students understand the pro-Palestinian protest chant âFrom the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Freeâ to mean the expulsion and genocide of Israeli Jews.â

Understanding that âzero tolerance does not mean zero occurrence,â accepting the Oversight Boardâs decision on this case will clearly indicate Metaâs willingness to tolerate violent hate speech on its platform. Moreover, the focus on the intent of the speaker over the impact of the speech in this decision shows a callous disregard for the experience of marginalized communities.

As the leaders of communities representing the largest Diaspora Jewish populations, we call on Meta to recognize the harm this phrase poses to the Jewish community worldwide, reject the Oversight Boardâs short-sighted decision and urge it instead to take steps to address the ongoing issues with online hate and harassment that continue to proliferate across Metaâs many platforms.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/legal-risks-divestment-israel-university-endowments,"There are many reasons why itâs a bad idea for university endowments to divest from Israel. Divestment serves to delegitimize Israel and puts the onus for solving the longstanding Palestinian-Israeli conflict on only one side. It could also likely lead to economic ramifications, such as reduced alumni giving and lower returns, as well as open up the potential for heavier taxation of endowment income.Â Â 

Â 

Beyond all of these arguments, universities that decide to divest from Israel could face more concrete obstacles to following through on it: They may be in breach of their fiduciary duties and even face legal risk in some states.Â Â Â 

Â 

Fiduciary BreachÂ 

Â 
University endowments generally have a professionally staffed Investment Office and an Investment Committee. The Investment Office is responsible for analyzing and proposing investment strategies, as well as eventually implementing those strategies. The Investment Committee is responsible for reviewing asset allocation policies, endowment performance, and strategy proposals and has ultimate oversight over investment decisions. Investment Committee members are usually individuals with investment expertise and some members may also be trustees of the university.Â 

Â 

Among the fiduciary obligations of Investment Committees is a legal responsibility for duties of care, loyalty, good faith, confidentiality, prudence and disclosure when serving the best financial interests of the university through managing the endowment investment.Â 

Â 

Divesting from Israel âwould be a breach of fiduciary obligation that could expose trustees to personal liability"" for not prioritizing the financial health and efficiency of the endowment portfolio, Max M. Schanzenbach, a professor at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law and an expert on fiduciary law, wrote in the Wall Street Journal.Â 

Â 

The Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA), enacted in 49 states (all but Pennsylvania), governs the management of institutional funds donated to charitable institutions. It was enacted to protect the assets of nonprofit institutions from misuse and loss.Â Â 

Â 

Among other things, UPMIFA provides guidance to those responsible for investment decision-making on behalf of nonprofit institutions, which includes most private and public colleges and universities. Nonprofits are encouraged to adopt spending policies that are not only aligned with donor intent but also flexible enough to accommodate economic changes, thereby preserving an endowment's principal over time.Â Â 

Â 

Under UPMIFA, voting to divest a universityâs endowment from Israel could be deemed imprudent, as it is politically motivated rather than based on sound investment decisions and a decision made without adequate economic analysis. Violators of UPMIFA can face legal challenges, monetary penalties, or even loss of nonprofit status.Â Â 

Â 

State LawsÂ 

Â 

Campus demands for Israel divestment stem from the longstanding anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Among U.S. states, there is broad bipartisan consensus opposed to BDS, with 38 states taking some actionâlaws, resolutions, and/or executive ordersâto discourage BDS activities.Â Â 

Â 

State attorneys general could therefore take legal action against universities pursuing divestment from Israel, potentially leading to costly lawsuits and further legal complications.Â 

Â 

In some states, laws prohibit state entities from contracting with businesses or other entities that boycott Israelâmeaning that universities that engage in the BDS movement could be jeopardizing existing state contracts and/or putting at risk other forms of state financial support of their institution.Â Â 

Â 

Itâs important to note that these concerns extend to private universities in addition to public ones. Private universities may very well have contracts with state entities and/or receive financial support from the state (such as research grants or for student financial aid programs), all of which could be in jeopardy. And UPMIFA requirements apply if the university operates as a nonprofit organization or its endowment is used for charitable purposes â which is the legal structure of nearly all universities.Â 

Â 

University trustees and Investment Committee members who disregard the legal and fiduciary responsibilities associated with Israel divestment expose themselves and their institutions to significant risk.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/hamas-execution-6-hostages-leaves-us-agony-and-yet-more-aligned-ever,"I landed in Israel on Monday today with a heavy heart. The news of Hamasâ execution of six hostages has cast a long, mournful shadow over Israel, on the entire Jewish people and on humanity itself. It is a dark time.

Funerals already have taken place for Ori Danino zâl, Carmel Gat zâl, Hersh Goldberg-Polin zâl, Alex Lubnov zâl, Almog Sarusi zâl and Edan Yerushalmi zâl. For nearly eleven months, their families have displayed extraordinary grace and tremendous strength in the face of the unthinkable. Theyâve done so again in the past few days as they bid farewell to their loved ones who were stolen from them and from all of us. Indeed, if you can watch the remarks of Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin at Hershâs funeral, it is worth the time. Their words are among the most agonizing and yet inspiring talks that you will ever hear.

This week, thousands of people will visit these six families to offer comfort and support as they sit shiva. I will do my best to represent all of you in these visits.

I paid a shiva call yesterday and visited with Hershâs parents. It wasnât at their home but in a large tent the Jerusalem municipality built to accommodate all the people. There were nearly 100 people in line, waiting to see them. It was so, so emotional and hard. Rachel and Jon are amazing, incredibly strong people.

Wednesday, I visited the site of the Nova festival on Kibbutz Reim. Although I know the stories, have met survivors, being there was truly harrowing. The pain absolutely seizes you as you take in the scale of the horror. It feels like a sacred space and yet it exudes a stillness. The site has evolved into a massive memorial with makeshift altars paying tribute to the 346 victims.

Finally, my soul suffered as I sat with hostage families and rescued hostages this evening in Tel Aviv, listening to their stories, each more harrowing than the next.

Their pain is unimaginable. There are no words. As one of them told me, ""It is simply beyond.""

As we pause and mourn those we have lost, we cannot rest. We must work through our grief and push forward for the sake of the 101 hostages who remain captive in Gaza. We owe it to them and to our own children who, one day, will ask how we led in this moment and learn from our example.

I spend my days fighting antisemitism, not prosecuting military conflict, but I am more convinced than ever that we will not bring the hostages home without a deal.

This is why the Israeli government, with the support of the US, must do absolutely everything it can, even making painful concessions, to reach an agreement. This is why Egypt, Qatar and Turkey must apply intense pressure on Hamas to free these innocent people â boys and girls, men and women, parents and grandparents â who are being starved and tortured in tunnels under Gaza. Hamas leaders sipping coffee and luxuriating in Doha need to start to feel severe consequences so the hostages are released immediately.

There is no excuse, no rationale, for this depravity to continue.

We must also demand that the US government and that the entire world community hold Hamas accountable for its grotesque, unprovoked attack on Israel; for the seizure and torture of 250 people including Israelis, Americans and others; for the devastating consequences that the war has wrought on the Jewish state; and for the catastrophic damage done to the people of Gaza. We welcome the US Justice Departmentâs indictments this week against Hamas leaders, but more needs to come. Hamas is a vicious organization that openly calls for genocide and acts on these evil plans. They have violated the most basic norms of our society. Like al Qaeda, ISIS and other terror organizations, it must be eradicated. Its patrons in Tehran who encourage their barbarism must be stopped. It will not be simple. Far from it. But there is no alternative.

Finally, we must make it 100% clear that we will never tolerate Jews â in Israel, America or anywhere else on Earth â being marginalized, threatened or violated just because of who we are. Marching and masking with the intent to harass and intimidate isnât freedom of assembly. Inciting violence isnât freedom of speech. These are criminal acts, and we will demand that the culprits who commit them are held accountable.

Whether on college campuses, in private spaces or in public places, it is long overdue for leaders at all levels to lead and to deter such shameful behavior with clear and consistent consequences. As long as ADL exists, hate against Jews or anyone else will never have safe harbor. We will be relentless. We will never give up the fight.

Again, these are difficult days. I share the anguish and heartbreak that so many of you feel. But, above all, as Jon Polin said at Hershâs funeral, citing Israelâs national anthem, we must remember that Od Lo Avda Tikvateinu â our hope is not lost.

May their memories forever be a blessing. #BringThemHome

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/free-legal-protection-helpline-college-students-received-requests,"September 3, 2024 ... Hillel International, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP today announced that the Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL) has received more than 650 requests for assistance from university students across the country who experienced antisemitic harassment, violence or discrimination in the first nine months of the program.

Through CALL, lawyers from leading firms provide free assistance to students reporting antisemitic discrimination and hate by conducting in-depth information-gathering interviews and offering pro bono representation in cases of violations of studentsâ civil rights under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Since CALLâs launch, nearly 100 attorneys from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and 40 other law firms fielded studentsâ requests for help. More than 250 individual practitioners also volunteered their time to support Jewish students.

Examples of CALLâs work on behalf of students include:

Providing legal support to a Jewish student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who was verbally harassed and physically assaulted because he was supportive of Israel and the hostages taken in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7.
After Jewish students attending The Ohio State University were assaulted, CALL worked with Jewish partner organizations to file a Title VI complaint.
As a result of a CALL intake, ADL and the Brandeis Center filed a Title VI complaint alleging the Pomona CollegeÂ administration failed to protect Jewish students as anti-Israel organizations held on-campus protests in violation of college regulationsÂ  that resulted in physical violence, intimidation, and occupation of campus buildings.
CALL drafted a letter to Princeton University leadership condemning the use of no-contact orders to silence a Jewish student journalist trying to report on anti-Israel protests. This led Princeton to change its policy so that these no-contact orders could no longer be issued under such circumstances and affirmed that the student would not face consequences for her journalism.

âAs antisemitism on campus skyrockets, CALL is making a difference in the lives of Jewish students every day by providing outstanding legal support to fight harassment andÂ  bigotry,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âCALL empowers students to take action and push back against those who perpetrate and enable hate on their campus.â

So far, CALL has received a wide variety of antisemitic incident reports including physical assaults; in-person and online harassment; exclusion from student organizations and other educational opportunities on campus; harassment, discrimination, and improper political indoctrination from professors in the classroom;Â  protestors who confront and harass Jewish and Israeli students on campus; vandalism and unauthorized removal of hostage and pro-Israel posters on campus; disruptions of regular classroom instruction and events sponsored by Jewish and pro-Israel organizations; and retaliatory bad faith complaints filed against Jewish students through universitiesâ internal grievance processes.

âWe know that addressing the scourge of antisemitism requires a multifaceted approach, and I am proud of the critical role that the Campus Antisemitism Legal Line has played during the past year,â said Adam Lehman, president and CEO of Hillel International. âAs a complement to our broader work supporting Jewish life on campus and addressing antisemitism, CALL offers an essential tool for Jewish students to get the help they need from leading legal experts to protect their civil rights.â

Recognizing the mounting concerns about the upcoming school year, the CALL helpline remains ready to assist and support Jewish students who face antisemitic incidents on campus.Â Students, family members, faculty, or staff members can go to the CALL website or text âCALLhelpâ to 51555 to report incidents of antisemitic discrimination, intimidation, harassment, vandalism, or violence that may necessitate legal action.

âThe law is a powerful motivator and an essential tool in the effort to combat antisemitism and protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination on campus,â said Alyza D. Lewin, president of the Brandeis Center. âThrough CALL, we have educated students on their legal rights, demanded universities meet their legal obligations, and perhaps most importantly, come together as a community in strength to empower and protect our students. They know that if they have the courage and confidence to wear their Jewish identity proudly, and they come under attack for that, we will have their back.â

During the 2023-2024 academic year, colleges and universities saw more than 1,400 antisemitic incidents on campuses â by far the highest number of antisemitic incidents in a single school year ever on record according to ADL and Hillel International tracking. Following the Oct. 7 attack, aÂ survey by Hillel and ADLÂ found that 73 percent of Jewish college students and 44 percent of non-Jewish students experienced or witnessed antisemitism on their campuses last fall.

""Weâre grateful to be part of this important effort to help victims of campus antisemitism. Gibson Dunn is committed to combating antisemitism and all forms of hate and intolerance,â said Barbara Becker, Gibson Dunn Chair and Managing Partner.

CALLâs supporting organizations include Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, the American Jewish Committee, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Jewish Agency for Israel, Jewish on Campus, the Jewish Federations of North America, JGO: The Jewish Grad Organization (formerly JGSI), the Israel on Campus Coalition, the Israeli-American Council, Masa, Olami, the OU Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Delta Tau, and Zeta Beta Tau.

A separate legal helpline providing pro bono legal assistance to parents whose children are experiencing antisemitism in Californiaâs K-12 schools is run by the Brandeis Center, ADL, and StandWithUs, along with four leading law firms. Parents and other interested adults in California can report incidents of antisemitic discrimination, intimidation, harassment, vandalism or violence occurring in K-12 schools to theÂ Legal Protection K-12 Helpline.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/alternative-germany-afd-party-what-you-need-know,"What is AfD?

Founded in 2013 as an anti-European Union party, AfD has since radicalized and become an extremist, anti-immigrant party whose aim is âto eliminate the free democratic basic order,â according to a 2023 report by the German Institute for Human Rights.

AfD leaders have made antisemitic, anti-Muslim and anti-democratic statements, detailed below.

The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt fÃ¼r Verfassungsschutz or BfV), its domestic intelligence agency which monitors extremist threats to Germanyâs democracy, has listed AfD as an officially suspected extremist organization and classified its youth wing, âYoung Alternative,â as extremist in April 2023.Â  The state-level BfV offices in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia have gone a step further and classified the AfD party as a whole as extremist. As a suspected extremist organization, AfD is subject to BfV intelligence collection, including the use of informants and surveillance of individuals and their communications.[1]ï¿¼Â 

Why is AfD of concern? Nazi slogans, Holocaust trivialization and more.

BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke, leader of the AfD party in the state of Thuringia, has twice been fined by a German court for using a banned Nazi slogan.Â  The phrase, âEverything for Germanyâ (âAlles fÃ¼r Deutschlandâ) was a slogan of the Nazi stormtroopers and engraved on their daggers.

In a 2017 speech to the AfD youth wing, HÃ¶cke bemoaned Germanâs culture of remembrance of the Holocaust, saying, âWe Germans, our people, are the only people in the world who planted a monument of shame in the middle of our national capital.â He called for Germany to stop atoning for Nazi crimes and make a ""180-degree turn"" in how it remembers its past.

Alexander Gauland, an AfD co-founder, former party leader, and current Member of Parliament, has engaged in Holocaust trivialization on several occasions.Â  In a 2018 speech to the AfD youth wing, he said, âHitler and the Nazis are just a speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.âÂ  Gauland also said in 2017 that Germans should be âproud of the achievements of German soldiers in two world wars.â

HÃ¶cke has engaged in extremist speech to the extent that a judge ruled that he could be described as a fascist without fear of a defamation suit, because such a description was a âvalue judgment based on facts.â

AfD leaders have also threatened to deport German citizens of non-ethnic-German heritage.

In its 2017 election manifesto, AfD asserted that the presence of Muslims in Germany was a threat to the country: âIslam does not belong in Germany. The AfD sees the spread of Islam and the presence of over 5 million Muslims, whose numbers are constantly growing, as a great danger to our state, our society and our system of values.â[2]

AfD members were exposed as participants in a November 2023 secret meeting of far-right extremists in Potsdam, including Austrian neo-Nazi Martin Sellner, who discussed a mass deportation plan for foreigners and ""non-assimilated"" Germans, as part of AfDâs strategy should it be elected to govern Germany.

Following the exposure of the secret meeting, AfD politicians initially denied participating, but just weeks later began actively campaigning with the slogan, âremigration,â which was the term used at the meeting for the mass deportation plan.


https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/deutschland/politik/afd-ostdeutschland-remigration-geheimtreffen-potsdam-100.html

This idea is hardly new for AfD.Â  In 2017, AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland said that Aydan Ãzoguz,Â  a Socialist Party politician, who was born in Germany to Turkish immigrant parents, should be âdisposed ofâ in Turkey.Â  Â 

Current AfD leader, Alice Weidel, then co-leader with Gauland, defended Gaulandâs statement.

Why so much concern now?

Germany has federal parliamentary elections on February 23 and AfD is polling at roughly 20%, in second place behind the Christian Democratic Union party at 30%.

In state elections in September 2024, AfD gained significantly, coming in first place in Thuringia with 33% of the vote, and a close second place in Saxony with over 30% of the vote.

As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, ADL takes no position in support of or in opposition to any candidate for elected office.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/economic-risks-divestment-israel-university-endowments,"As encampment protests riled college campuses throughout the Spring 2024 semester, some universities agreed to formally consider protestorsâ demands that their endowments divest from companies with business interests in Israel. It is the latest iteration of the years-long Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign that seeks to isolate Israel economically.Â 

Â 

Brown University reached an agreement for student protestors to take down their encampment and refrain from further disrupting campus life. In exchange, the governing Corporation of Brown University will hold a formal vote on divestment in October. UC Riverside, The New School and Johns Hopkins University came to similar agreements with students. With anti-Israel divestment protests likely to gain steam again when students return to campuses at the end of summer break, other universities may very well follow this example.Â 

Â 

However, acquiescing to these demands carries significant economic risks that can easily have a deep negative impact on those endowments. These include lower endowment returns, reduced alumni contributions, and constrained access to capital. This trifecta of challenges, as well as additional tax-related risks, would have real-world consequences, impacting a universityâs ability to fund scholarships and research and to maintain its facilities.Â Â 

Â 

All of this is in addition to the many moral and legal reasons to oppose divestment. Divestment campaigns unjustly single out Israel as solely responsible for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and feed the demonization of Israel and rise of antisemitism.Â 

Â 

Protestorsâ goals vary school by school, but many are demanding that their endowments divest from all companies with any ties to Israel. Others are seeking more limited divestment only from companies that produce weapons or have direct military ties, like Boeing. Regardless, universities that agree to divestment are likely to face significant economic ramifications.Â 

Â 

Lower Endowment ReturnsÂ 
Â 

We live today in a more globalized and financially interconnected world than we ever did in the pastâcertainly more so than during the 1980s South Africa divestment movement.Â Â 

Â 

According to JLens, an ADL affiliate representing the endowments of Jewish organizations with assets totaling $10 billion, more than 100 companies from the S&P 500 conduct business in Israel. This includes some of the largest and most successful global companies, like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.Â Â 

Â 

More recent campus divestment movements, such as those in the 2010s focused on guns and fossil fuels, involved removing relatively small numbers of companies whose businesses directly revolved around those issues from university endowments.Â Â 

Â 

Fully divesting from Israel, therefore, is not a straightforward process of selling off investments in a handful of companies. Given the sheer number of companies with economic ties to Israel and the size of some of those companies, itâs not a stretch to predict that divestment could result in significantly lower returns and a less diversified portfolio.Â Â 
Â 

Lower Alumni ContributionsÂ 

Â 

Universities that divest from Israel, in either an expansive or more limited form, also risk alienating donors and alumni for whom a connection to Israel is core to their Jewish identity.Â Â 

Â 

Already, a number of high-profile, high-net-worth donors have announced theyâre withdrawing support from their alma maters because of campus antisemitism and what they see as universities' inadequate responses to protect Jewish students. Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team and a major donor to Columbia University, is just one example. And the same is true for an unknown number of rank-and-file donors whose names (and net worths) do not make headlines. Jesse M. Fried, a Professor at Harvard Law School, and David H. Webber, a Boston University Law School professor, note in a Newsweek piece that the âfurther universities move in the direction of boycotting Israel in any respect, the further donations will fall.âÂ Â 

Â 

Additionally, even donors who do not care deeply about the Israel issue specifically may be frustrated by universities' willingness to consider divestment demands from students who have violated school policies and fueled antisemitism on campusâespecially since those demands can decrease the value of the universityâs endowment.Â 

Â 

Reduced Access to CapitalÂ 

Â 

As donors increasingly withhold contributionsâand endowments suffer from the lower returns that divestment will bringâuniversities divesting from Israel may face reduced access to capital. This would, in turn, force them to rely more on debt financing.Â Â 

Â 

Investors may also view divesting universities as higher risk, leading to lower bond prices and higher borrowing costs, making it harder for universities to finance themselves.Â Â 

Â 
Tax Risks

Â 

In recent years, the taxation of endowment income has become a contentious political issue, with lawmakers increasingly viewing it as a potential tool to influence university behavior. Although the idea of taxing university endowments was for decades considered off-limits, this is no longer the case. Since 2018, many private colleges and universities have been subject to a 1.4% federal excise tax on endowment income.Â 

Â 

More recently, some lawmakers have proposed taxing endowments even more aggressively in cases where universities fail to adequately protect students from antisemitism on campus or allow disruptive encampments. In fact, several congressional bills suggest raising the current 1.4% tax rate on endowment income to significantly higher levels, ranging from six to as much as fifty percent, depending on the circumstances and perceived infractions of the universities in question. (On the state level, too, some lawmakers have proposed levying taxes on large private university endowments, albeit for different policy reasons.)Â 
Â 
As the idea of taxing endowments becomes an increasingly politicized issue, universities that use their endowments to make political statements, such as divesting from Israel, risk exposing themselves to higher taxes on their endowment income.
Â 

Once political considerations enter the conversation about endowment investing, universities can expect to face unintended consequences like those outlined hereâand, in all likelihood, others that may not even be foreseeable at this point. Avoiding this path allows endowment decisions to remain focused on providing universities the financial support they need for continued academic excellence and positive impact on the world.Â Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-finds-many-social-media-platforms-are-not-fully-complying-newly,"Sacramento, CA. August 28, 2024â¦ Several major social media platforms are not complying fully with either the letter or the spirit of a new California law aimed at holding them accountable for spreading hate and harassment. A newÂ reportÂ released by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society (CTS) evaluates the first rounds of transparency reporting for social media platforms as required by this first-of-its-kind law. in California with the goal of getting social media platforms to stop hiding hate.

While most tech companies have rules against hate and harassment, they have not been held accountable to the American public for enforcing them. This changed with the signing of California Assembly Bill 587, also known as the Social Media Transparency Bill, which requires social media platforms to publicly disclose their community safety guidelines and report data around hate, harassment, misinformation, disinformation, foreign interference, and the enforcement of their policies. Prior to this law taking effect, transparency reports were published voluntarily on an ad-hoc basis, were largely inconsistent and far from transparent (see ADLâsÂ Platform Transparency Reports â Just How Transparent?).

ADLâs report -Â AB 587 Revisited: How are Platforms Complying with Californiaâs Newly-Mandated Transparency Reporting?â analyzed nine platformsâ mandated reports from January and April 2024. Though reporting has already improved from January to April, several major platforms avoided complying fully with either the letter or the spirit of the law. ADL found that Discord, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Roblox committed to addressing hate and appear to have made efforts to publish detailed, informative reports. Overall, ADL found that even with these newly produced reports, platforms do not always provide the necessary context to make sense of their numbers, putting the public at a disadvantage when making sense of these platformsâ efforts to quell hate online.

Given the alarming rise in hate online in recent years, ADL sponsored AB 587 from its inception in 2021. According to ADLâs most recentÂ Online Hate and Harassment report, 22% of Americans experienced severe harassment on social media in the past 12 months, an increase from 18% in 2023. In addition, 61% of those harassed said at least some harassment happened on Facebook, 39% on Instagram, and 28% on Twitter.

âWe know that online hate â especially unchecked hate â can and does lead to offline violence,â said Robert Trestan, Divisional Vice President of ADL West. âStudies have linked hate-motivated violence, mass shootings, and mental health issues to online activity on social media â much of which disproportionately targets and affects young people and people from marginalized communities. Most social media platforms, despite being aware of the dangers, have taken few steps to resolve them. With AB 587 in effect, these companies are now held accountable for hiding hate on their platforms.â

Platforms that do not comply with the mandated reporting may be fined up to $15,000 per day byÂ the California Attorney General, or almost $3 million per company since the law went into force. Some platforms are pushing back, and the law is being challenged in federal court in a case led by X and is currently in appeal. These challenges are not slowing national efforts to boost more social media transparency. In July 2024, Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA)Â introduced legislation, endorsed by ADL, to protect social media users from hate speech and increase transparency from tech companies.

ADL hopes to see continued improvement with the next round of transparency reports scheduled for October 2024.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/campus-divestment-campaigns-jlens-unpacks-demands-and-consequences,"Anti-Israel protests and encampments became regular fixtures on many college campuses in the months following Hamasâs October 7 attack on Israel. From Columbia to UCLA, the pattern was similar, with students setting up tents in prominent spots and refusing to leave. In many cases, they have taken over and vandalized campus buildings, disrupted classes and graduations, declared Zionists unwelcome, and harassed Jewish students, creating a climate of fear among Jewish and other Israel-supporting members of the college community. Some campus protestors were even seen lauding Hamas and advocating for violence.Â 

Â 

Four years after their high-school graduations were scaled down or canceled because of Covid, many college seniors saw the same thing happen to their university commencements this year, albeit because of the threat of disruption by protestors. And while encampments generally dissipated when school ended for the summerâor when they were forcibly dispersed by policeâthere is every reason to believe anti-Israel students (and non-student participants) will re-pitch their tents and rehang their signs when they return to campus for the fall semester.Â 

Â 

In order to effectively combat this campaign, it is essential to understand the protestorsâ demands and the powerful counter-arguments against them. Articulating a clear, convincing case against divestment is increasingly urgent, especially as some universities, such as Brown, UC Riverside, The New School, and Johns Hopkins have negotiated agreements with protestors to end encampments in return for debating and voting on their demands for divestment.Â Â 

Â 

Understanding the Divestment CampaignÂ 

Â 

This wave of protests is the latest iteration of the wider Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign that has gained steam in recent years. BDS is an international campaign aimed at delegitimizing and pressuring Israel through diplomatic, financial, professional, academic, and cultural isolation. Its ultimate goal is not to create a Palestinian state, but to dismantle the Jewish state.Â 

Â 

Campus calls for divestment also harken back toâand are purposely modeled afterâthe successful 1980s campus divestment movement against South Africa as well as more recent campus divestments relating to causes such as gun violence and environmentalism.Â Â 

Â 

Even aside from the false and offensive implication that Israel is on par with the deeply oppressive Apartheid-era South Africa, there are significant moral, economic, and practical differences between previous divestment movements and the current campaign.Â 

Â 

So, what do these protestors actually want?Â Â 

Â 

Although the details differ campus to campus, the short answer is to divest from Israel. That means the university would cease doing business with or investing through their endowments in any company connected to Israel.Â 

Â 

Economic ImplicationsÂ 

Â 

To be clear, some protestors are demanding university divestment from all companies with any connection to, or operations in, Israel. That does not just include weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin but also companies like Amazon, Google, McDonalds and every retail chain store and tech company with an Israel location or contract with an Israeli business.Â Â 

Â 

Needless to say, that amounts to a lot of companies that would suddenly be excluded from an investment portfolio. More than 100 companies from the S&P 500 conduct business in Israel, including many of the world's largest and most successful companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google) and Amazon.Â Â 

Â 

Divestment from Israel could therefore result in lower returns and a less diversified portfolio. This could adversely affect the university's ability to fund scholarships and research, and to maintain its facilities.Â 

Â 

Compounding the impact, deciding to divest from Israel risks alienating alumni and donors, who could decide to reduce their contributions or withhold them entirely, resulting in greater financial losses for the university.Â 

Â 

Fiduciary & Legal ImplicationsÂ 

Â 

The potential for these negative consequences to the health of university endowments raises another issue arguing against divestment from Israel. University endowments are run by Investment Offices, with an Investment Committee holding ultimate oversight over investment decisions, responsible for reviewing asset allocation policies, endowment performance, and strategy proposals. Investment Committees have a fiduciary duty, which is a legal responsibility, to make decisions in the best financial interests of the university when managing the endowment investment. Allowing political considerations and pressure campaigns to dictate investment decisions could be a breach of this duty.Â 

Â 

Choosing to divest from Israel could also bring additional legal hurdles for universities. More than 30 states have laws or executive orders prohibiting or discouraging BDS activities. State attorneys general could pursue legal action against universities engaging in boycotts directed against companies doing business with Israel.Â Â 

Â 

Delegitimizing IsraelÂ 

Â 

Agreeing to divest from Israel would set a dangerous precedent for universities. Doing so opens the door for activists supporting all sorts of causes for all sorts of reasons to make similar demands that their university divest from companies involved in a wide range of industries or practices. Such a trend could significantly limit the endowment's investment options, affecting returns and the ability to support university goals.Â 

Â 

Instead of pushing for divestment, activists could advocate for their universities to promote programs of peace and co-existence between Israelis and Palestinians. They could demand their university endowments become activist shareholders in the companies in which they invest, using their leverage to push those companies to make strategic investments in the Palestinian economy and in peace-building initiatives.Â Â 

Â 

But that is not what is happening. The sheer breadth of activistsâ demands makes it clear what their real agenda is: isolation and delegitimization of Israel.Â Â 

Â 

Their intention becomes clearer when you consider some of the slogans protestors have usedâincluding âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be freeâ--explicitly calling for the eradication of Israel. Others have taken aim at all Jews, with protesters at Columbia University, for instance, yelling to Jewish students to âgo back to Poland.âÂ 

Â 

Israel, like every country, is imperfect and faces tremendous societal challenges. But Israel is a democracy where citizens enjoy equal rights and the worldâs only Jewish state. Comparisons to Apartheid-era South Africa and accusations of genocide are factually false, morally misguided, and used as justifications for the delegitimization of Israel. But they donât hold up to scrutiny.Â 

Â 

The ramifications of these accusations and of campus protests extend far beyond the immediate demands for divestment. Jewish students across numerous campuses report feeling increasingly marginalized and unsafe, with many questioning their place within the university community. As universities grapple with these complex issues, they must balance the right to protest with their responsibility to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students especially as anti-Israel protestors vow to fight on. The ongoing debate surrounding divestment not only affects university finances and policies but also shapes the very fabric of campus life and the educational experience for countless students. This needs to be taken into consideration as some universities will be debating and voting on divestment proposals in the coming months.Â Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/lawsuit-uncovers-antisemitic-intent-within-santa-ana-unified-school,"Motion filed supports allegations that SAUSD intentionally violated the Brown Act, Californiaâs open meetings laws, to develop and approve antisemitic curriculum âunder the radar.â

Santa Ana, Calif., August 26, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, AJC (the American Jewish Committee), and Covington & Burling announced today thatÂ they filed a motion adding supporting evidence to theÂ suit they filed in September 2023 on behalf of the Brandeis Center and its membership arm, So-CUE (Southern Californians for Unbiased Education), against the Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD) for violationsÂ ofÂ Californiaâs open meetings laws.

Evidence uncovered during discovery supports the Plaintiffsâ allegations that the Board kept information about proposed ethnic studies courses âunder the radarâ (in the words of one employee) to prevent the public, and the Jewish community in particular, from becoming aware of antisemitic and unlawfully biased content in ethnic studies curricula. For example:

When members of SAUSDâs Ethnic Studies Steering Committee were apprised ofÂ theÂ Jewish communityâs concerns about antisemitism in ethnic studies plans, they noted in an official agenda that they would need to âaddress the Jewish question.â
Senior officials mused about using Jewish holidays to approve courses at the Board level to prevent Jews from attending.
The Steering Committee hired an external consultant whose writings equate Israel with âsettler colonialismâ and who uses social media to actively promote anti-Israel bias with antisemitic tropes, including a post about âZionist control of the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculumâ and a comment that the Legislative Jewish Caucus needs to âstay in their lane,â claiming âthe Zionist CA Jewish Caucus hijacked Ethnic Studies,â as well as âa small white minorityâ should not âdictate a curriculum that is not about them.â
A Committee leader referred to the only Jewish member as a âcolonized Jewish mindâ and a âf---ing babyâ for expressing concerns over antisemitism on the Committee.
An SAUSD Board member suggested that Jewish Americans do not belong in ethnic studies because they are âracialized as under the White category.â
A Committee leader referred to the Jewish Federation of Orange County as âracist Zionistsâ and suggested SAUSD should not âcaveâ to their representatives.
Members of the Steering Committee reportedly said, âJews are not a disadvantaged ethnic group in the U.S. because they were never slaves,â that âJews greatly benefit from white privilege, so they have it better,â and âwe don't need to give both sides. We only support the oppressed, and Jews are the oppressors.â
Jewish staff members at SAUSD wrote about how they were âsickâ of the âthinly veiled antisemitismâ coming from Committee leaders and were âhurt by some of thingsâ they âsaid about Jews.â

Under the Brown Act (Californiaâs open meeting laws) and AB 101 (the 2021 statute making ethnic studies a requirement for graduation from public high schools), California school boards are required to take specific steps to make members of the public aware of proposed curricula and allow for public comment.

The motion and supporting evidence proves that SAUSD knowingly circumvented these laws to approve curricula with dangerously anti-Jewish teachings before the public became aware of them. The lawsuit asks the court to declare that SAUSD violated the Brown Act, to bar SAUSD from teaching courses that were unlawfully approved, and to order SAUSD to follow open meeting laws going forward so that new ethnic studies courses are not pushed through without community input.

âBoth the Brown Act and AB 101 require transparency and opportunity for public comment on proposed ethnic studies curricula that deviate from the state-approved model curriculum,â said L. Rachel Lerman, General Counsel of the Brandeis Center, which is both a plaintiff and counsel in this matter. âGovernor Newsom swore that biased and antisemitic content taken out of early (and disapproved) versions of the model curriculum would ânever see the light of day.â He did not mean that this content should be snuck back in under cover of darkness, but that appears to be what has occurred.â

âOpen meetings are required by law specifically to prevent this type of situation,â said James Pasch, ADL Senior Director of National Litigation. âAs the evidence shows, the district intentionally hid information from the public, to try to get away with teaching antisemitic lies to the next generation in Santa Ana. The antisemitism that infected this process sent a clear message to Jewish students and families that their voices are not welcomed, and that they were intentionally excluded.â

âThis is not speculation. Discovery in this case has revealed a persistent pattern of antisemitism in the steering committee,â saidÂ American Jewish Committee Chief Legal Officer Marc Stern.Â âAntisemitism has no place in any governmental body and it is doubly concerning when it involves children and their education. That proponents of this proposal made a concerted effort to hide their antisemitism is yet further evidence that they knew what they were doing was wrong and did not want it disclosed publicly.â

âAs Justice Louis D. Brandeis famously observed, 'sunlight is the best disinfectant.' The shocking evidence our team has uncovered shows that SAUSD deliberately tried to keep the public in the dark about the extreme biases and antisemitism that infected the District's ethnic studies curriculum. In doing so, SAUSD violated State law,â said Dan Shallman, lead counsel from Covington & Burling LLP. âWe look forward to making our case in court that SAUSD's actions must not stand. We are proud to stand with our partners at the ADL, the Brandeis Center, and AJC, in seeking to hold SAUSD accountable.â

ADL, the Brandeis Center, AJC, and Covington & Burling serve as the plaintiffsâ counsel for this case. A hearing is scheduled for September 19, 2024.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/turkey-attacker-inspired-accelerationism-and-mass-killers-manifesto-shows,"An 18-year-old suspect who livestreamed himself stabbing multiple people near a mosque in the Turkish city of EskiÅehir on August 12, 2024, was fueled by the extremist belief in accelerationism and motivated by past mass killers including white supremacists, an analysis by the ADL Center on Extremism has shown.Â 

Â 

Wearing a skull mask and a tactical vest with a sonnenrad patch â both common symbols utilized by white supremacists and accelerationists â and armed with a hatchet and two knives, the teen injured at least five people during the filmed attack, which quickly circulated on X and Telegram. He was later apprehended and detained by police.Â 

Â 

The investigation by COE found that on the day of the stabbings, the assailant created a Telegram chat where he shared a file containing his âmanifestoâ -- which was rife with antisemitism -- and other extremist publications. Just minutes before the attack, another Telegram user reshared links to the manifesto and forwarded a post from the suspect with the planned time of the attack, announcing the âSTREAM WILL START IN A FEW MINUTES.âÂ  Following the attack, that same user shared a recording of the attackerâs livestream.Â 

Â 

Turkish media outlets have reported that the assailant discussed the attack with someone from Eastern Europe on Steam, a gaming and social media platform.Â Â 

Â 

Attackerâs ScreedÂ Â 

Â 

A review of the attackerâs âmanifestoâ indicated that he harbors extreme misanthropic and racist views; was inspired by many prior mass killers, including white supremacists; and was driven by accelerationism, an extremist belief that society is irredeemable, collapse is inevitable and the best course of action is to âaccelerateâ this collapse through chaos and violence.Â Â 

Â 

In his manifesto, the attacker wrote â[t]his system will eventually collapse ... [m]y actions and yours will accelerate this collapse and sooner or later the country, and then the world, will be covered in anarchy.â He also urged readers to âgo to the nearest electrical transformer station and sabotage it ... you can even take it to the next level and cut down the electrical transmission towers in any forest.âÂ Â 

Â 

Such calls for sabotage are often seen in accelerationist propaganda.Â Â 

Â 

Describing himself as a âNational Socialist,â the attacker expressed hatred for a range of people, including Kurds, Jews, communists, feminists and Black people. He referenced Jews more than any other group, encouraging others to attack synagogues, sharing antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and promoting the false claim that Jews finance degeneracy.Â 

Â 

COE also uncovered antisemitic comments the assailant posted on Steam in 2023. Using the screen name âSkrewdriver,â the assailant wrote ""getting a job is Jewish I'd rather stay unemployed"" and shared multiple copy pastas memes (blocks of digital text that can be copied and pasted across platforms) about ""ZOG,"" an acronym for âZionist Occupied Governmentâ that references the antisemitic belief that the government is controlled by Jews.Â 

Â 

Copypastas posted on Steam by the attacker referencing ZOG (Zionist Occupied Government) in July 2023.Â 

Â 

The assailant claimed he was not associated with an extremist group and declared that he was a âlone wolf.â He also expressed admiration for other lone wolf far-right mass killers including the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, who killed over 70 people, the shooter in the 2019 mosque attacks in New Zealand who gunned down 50 people, and the Jacksonville gunman who killed three at a store in 2023.Â Â 

Â 

The teen suspect likened himself to these killers, all of whom are regularly lauded by accelerationists, and expressed a desire to be listed among them following his attack.Â  He also hoped to inspire others to act on their hatred and encouraged readers to livestream their own violent actions to encourage future attackers.Â Â Â 

Â 

InfluencesÂ 

Â 

The EskiÅehir attacker expressed admiration for many mass killers throughout his manifesto, referring to terrorists such as the Oslo shooter, the Christchurch shooter, and the Oklahoma City bomber as âsaints,â a term of reverence used by accelerationists. He also included photos of other American mass killers that he admired, including the Columbine shooters and Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber.Â 

Â 

Essentially using predecessor attacks as a blueprint, the EskiÅehir attacker emulated elements of their actions and writings. Mimicking both the Christchurch and Jacksonville shooters, he included a âQuestion and Answerâ section in his manifesto and scrawled white supremacist symbols on his weapon, including a swastika, SS bolts and KKK. He also livestreamed his rampage on social media â a tactic utilized by several prior mass attackers.Â 

Â

Â 

Although he lived in Turkey, the EskiÅehir attacker appears to have been heavily influenced by Western extremist propaganda. In his manifesto, he used English-language memes and slurs and included the logo for the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, a US based neo-Nazi accelerationist group. The file of propaganda he shared along with his manifesto included Siege, a collection of essays written by American neo-Nazi James Mason, and Industrial Society and its Future, the manifesto of American domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski.Â 

Â 

The EskiÅehir attacker also encouraged readers to make explosives and âblow up federal buildingsâ in a manner similar to the Oklahoma City bomber, though Turkey, being a unitary state, does not have equivalent âfederal buildings.â He also held great disdain for communists, a common refrain among far-right extremists in the United States and wrote that he initially planned to attack a building belonging to the Turkish Communist Party despite it holding little power or significance in Turkish politics.Â Â 

Â 

At the same time, the dislike of radical leftist groups which have been villainized by Turkeyâs Islamist-ultranationalist ruling bloc shows local influence.Â 

Â 

The EskiÅehir attackerâs influences extended beyond American mass killers. Along with his manifesto, he shared copies of the Christchurch and Bratislava shooterâs manifestos, as well as all three publications released by the Terrorgram Collective, an international network of propagandists that create instructional manuals designed to inspire acts of violence and sabotage. In his screed, the suspect advised readers to save these documents, as they would be âusefulâ to those who seek to plan their own attack.Â 

Â 

The assailant also appears to have been influenced by online gamer culture, dedicating a section of his manifesto to an item list assigning points based on the attackerâs clothing, weapons, methods and number of casualties, seeking to gamify his attack and future ones carried out by others.Â Â 

Â 

Extremist ReactionsÂ 

Â 

While the Turkey mosque attacker sought to inspire others and join the ranks of the mass killers, he has largely been ridiculed by other extremists online. On 4chan and incels.is, a popular incels forum, users have criticized the assailant for failing to kill anyone. On Telegram, some white supremacist and accelerationist groups disavowed his actions altogether because they considered him to be non-white.","[2, 3, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.2, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.6}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-honor-music-industry-legend-scooter-braun-his-leading-role-bringing,"Braun to be recognized at 30th anniversary ADL Concert Against Hate at the Kennedy Center


New York, NY, August 15, 2024 â ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced that entertainment executive Scooter Braun will be recognized for his instrumental role in bringing the Nova Music Festival Exhibition to audiences in the United States. â6:29 AM: the Moment the Music Stood Stillâ powerfully chronicles the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre at the Nova Music Festival in Israel, where thousands gathered for a celebration of life, peace and music.Â 

A poignant, powerful tribute, the Nova exhibition serves as a wide, in-depth remembrance of the 405 people killed, 45 people kidnapped, and a tribute to those who survived the largest massacre in music history and the deadliest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust.

Braun will be honored during the 2024 ADL In Concert Against Hate, for his courageous leadership in bringing the exhibition to communities across the U.S. and for being an ardent advocate for the Jewish community. The Nova Music Festival Exhibition comes to Los Angeles this month after a sold-out extended run in New York, where 113,000 visitors honored the departed during a period of three months.

âSince Oct. 7, Scooter Braun has used his platform and voice to share stories of survivors, advocate for the return of hostages and to educate his followers and the public about the horrific events that day,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âAt a time when some were trying to explain away or even deny the atrocities that took place at the Nova Music Festival, Braun was working tirelessly to ensure this exhibit was seen by countless people across America, giving them the painful but essential experience of staring directly into the face of hate and finding the resolve to fight it.â

âOn Oct. 7th the largest massacre in the history of music took place at the Nova Music Festival and in response too many in our industry stayed silent. Over 400 innocent music lovers were murdered and over 40 taken hostage and many still waiting to come home. Music must always be aÂ safe place and the silence was deafening,â said Scooter Braun. âAlongside Joe Teplow, Josh Kadden, and the amazing organizers of Nova, we were able to bring this exhibit to fruition in New York, and now Los Angeles. Our goal is to have all people see themselves through their own love of music and live concerts. I am honored and humbled to accept this award, and accept it on behalf of the amazing tribe of Nova. We canât and should not look awayâ¦ and we must dance again.â

Braun was recently awarded by Mayor Eric Adams of New York for his efforts to encourage peace during the annual Jewish Heritage Celebration at Gracie Mansion in May. Braun also launched the Care Together campaign in March, where he donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Care International and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, to get much needed financial support to the people most acutely impacted by the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine.

Braun also served as co-founder of the One Love Manchester benefit concert, in response to the May 22, 2017 terrorist bombing at Manchester Arena, which killed 22 people and injured over 1,000. In only two weeks, Braun, alongside Ariana Grande, Simon Moran, and Melvin Benn, organized the concert and telethon, which was attended by over 55,000 people and saw proceeds donated to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund to help victims of the attack and their families. Following the show, the British Red Cross received more than Â£10 million in donations.

Braun is also part of the First Responders Childrenâs Foundation, World Central Kitchen, Safe Heart, HIAS, Pencils of Promise, Fuck Cancer, Care.org, Save a Childâs Heart, serves as a board member of Make A Wish and Pencils of Promise, and personally founded, led efforts for, or heavily participated within the Hand in Hand benefit after Hurricane Harvey, March for Our Lives, the Stuck with U x First Responders Childrenâs Foundation, and the Braun Fellowship for Youth Activism.

ADLâs âIn Concert Against Hateâ will celebrate its 30th anniversary this fall at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. The annualÂ concert and award ceremony recognizes celebrities and everyday heroes who have played a significant role in standing up to hatred, injustice and bias across society. This yearâs In Concert Against Hate will be held on Monday, Nov. 18 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/news/theres-no-place-antisemitism-especially-not-olympics,"Given the harrowing history of Israel at the games, we must be vigilant in safeguarding Jewish athletes


by Jonathan Greenblatt

The 2024 Paris Olympicsâ motto is âGames Wide Openâ â but we must ask: Are these games truly wide open to Israelis and Jews?

Sports are often touted as a great equaliser, especially at the Olympics. However, sports can also serve as a vehicle for harmful elements in society, including anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination. Â 

Even before the games began, Israeli athletes faced threats promising âWe will repeat Munich 1972â, referring to the Olympic games in Munich where Palestinian terrorists murdered 11 Israeli athletes. The Israeli team was later forced to carry out the memorial ceremony for those same 1972 Israeli victims in secret.

Kicking off the opening ceremony, a Palestinian Olympian was allowed to wear a shirt depicting bombs dropping from planes despite political messaging restrictions for all countries. Meanwhile, Israeli Olympians were barred from wearing yellow ribbons in support of the 115 Israeli hostages who are still being held by Hamas.

In a soccer match between Israel and Paraguay, members of the crowd chanted âHeil Hitlerâ and held up their hands in Nazi salutes. And the list goes on.

We cannot stand by as Israeli and Jewish athletes are targeted by such attacks. Given the harrowing history of Israel at the Olympic Games, we must be especially vigilant in safeguarding their physical and mental well-being â both crucial to their performance.

These athletes have dedicated their lives to reaching this moment and have achieved extraordinary successes this past week, including winning a record of three medals in one day on Saturday. They achieved this while already facing immense pressure, and dealing with everything from unsportsmanlike behavior to outright death threats is unacceptable.

Sports have the power to unite and inspire, but when antisemitism or any other form of discrimination seeps into this arena, it undermines these ideals and creates a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli athletes.

But letâs be clear: The anti-Semitism weâre witnessing in the 2024 Olympic Games didnât happen in a vacuum. In Europe, Latin America and beyond, tensions in the Middle East have long led to increases in anti-Semitic attacks. However, we havenât experienced anything like the tsunami of anti-Jewish hate unleashed worldwide following the Hamas atrocities of October 7.

According to ADLâs 2023 Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents, the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in the United States reached an unprecedented all-time high, reflecting a 140 per cent increase from the previous year. In the three-month period between October 7 and the end of 2023, ADL recorded more anti-Semitic incidents than any other year on record with a shocking 5,204 incidents. Thatâs an average of 60 per day.

This trend is not unique to the United States; similar spikes are occurring globally.

The United Kingdom saw a 147 per cent increase in anti-Semitic incidents between 2022 and 2023. Since October 7, around 100 anti-Semitic incidents have taken place in France every month. Alarmingly, even before October 7, 96 per cent of Jews in Europe reported that they had encountered anti-Semitism in the past year â essentially, everyone.

Whatâs important to remember when skimming over these shocking figures is that these statistics arenât just numbers. There is an innocent human being behind every one of them.

Jewish children in the Philadelphia school district are facing anti-Semitic bullying and harassment from within the educational institutions that are supposed to protect them. Jewish schools and community centers are being attacked in Canada. A 12-year-old Jewish girl was gang raped in a Parisian suburb.

Wake up. When anti-Zionists and violent extremists demonise and dehumanise Israelis and the Jewish state, whether on or off the field, it leads to the dehumanisation and terrorisation of Jews worldwide.

To preserve the integrity of sports and uphold a safe, respectful environment for all participants, we must confront and eradicate anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. There is simply no place for it.

Ensuring that every athlete can compete without fear or prejudice is not just a matter of fairness â itâs essential to maintaining the true spirit of the games.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

It is predictable but still problematic to see Israel scapegoated as the cause of the riots raging across the United Kingdom involving far-right elements. This is happening across social media. The claims have no basis and contribute to the increasing anxiety among the Jews in the country, a segment of British society already alienated by an enormous spike in antisemitic incidents.

While the far-right elements involved in the riots have their own history of antisemitism â including Holocaust denial and praise for Hitler â the riots themselves have sparked antisemitic conspiracy theories claiming the unrest is the result of an Israeli plot.

On August 3, 2024, American white supremacist and antisemite Nicholas Fuentes floated the idea that former leader of the English Defense League (EDL), Tommy Robinson (AKA Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), had sparked the riots to punish the UK Government for suspending arms export licenses to Israel. He provided no facts to substantiate this allegation.

Robinson â an anti-Muslim extremist who himself has been associated with the far-right â has made a show of support for Israel on a number of occasions, but this support has been condemned as unwelcome by the Board of DeputiesÂ of British Jews and the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.7, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.9}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/haniyeh-his-own-words,"Ismail Haniyeh, who wasÂ killed on July 31, 2024 in Tehran, led the so-called politburo ofÂ Hamas, aÂ US-designated Islamist terror organization dedicated to the destruction of the State of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.

Hamasâ foundingÂ covenant issued in 1988, which echoes the notoriousÂ Protocols of the Elders of Zion charging Jews with an international conspiracy to gain control of the world, is replete with antisemitism, just as its revisedÂ 2017 charter. In Hamasâ world-view, Islamic precepts forbid a Jewish state in the area known as Palestine, and the Jewish people have no legitimate connection to the land of Israel. As its covenant proclaims, ""The land of Palestine is an Islamic trust... It is forbidden to anyone to yield or concede any part of it... Israel will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it..."" To this end, the leaders of Hamas have denounced compromise with Israel as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.

Since his death, various figures have labeled Haniyeh as a moderating force, and separate from Hamas' extreme ideology and terrorist actions, yet nothing could be further from the truth.Â  Hamas' ideology and terrorism were deeply integral to Haniyeh's own operations and statements.

Following quotes expose Haniyehâs extremist worldview:

Speaking before the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Qatar on January 9, 2024, Haniyeh justified the October 7 attacks as a response to the success of the Abraham Accords,Â Â saying:

""[â¦] why was there the Al-Aqsa Flood, why this roaring flood, this strategic shift in the path of resistance and jihad? In response, I say there were three developments before the Al-Aqsa Flood, before the seventh of October. The first development is the marginalization of the Palestinian cause at the global level. The international community, global decision-making circles no longer invoke the Palestinian cause.""

He also celebrated the October 7 at the same event in Qatar,Â saying:

""We must build upon this victory that occurred on the seventh of October. We must hold on to it, build upon it, and accumulate it.""

On October 26, 2023, in the wake of the October 7 attacks and Israelâs response, Haniyeh welcomed and celebrated the deaths of ordinary Palestinians in Gaza,Â saying:

""As I have said repeatedly, the blood of children, women, and the elderly should not make you cry out! Rather, we need this blood to awaken the revolution, to awaken stubbornness, to awaken and move forward.""

In an Al-Jazeera interview aired in January 2022, Haniyeh celebrated Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli cities:

In reference to the targeting of Israeli cities during the 2021 Gaza crisis (May 6 â 21, 2021) Haniyeh described mass rocket attacks on Tel Aviv as a ""strategic victory""Â saying, ""for 11 days, the rockets of the Qassam Brigades rained down on every inch of Israel, and especially its heart â Tel Aviv, the heart of trade, economic activity, business [â¦] Tel Aviv was targeted, in less than 5 minutes [â¦] with 130 rockets from inside the Gaza Strip.""

In an interview dated July 26, 2020, Haniyeh boasted of rejecting a ceasefire agreement, and insisted on the annihilation of Israel as a condition for disarming Hamas:

In reference to a peace deal offer by which HaniyehÂ explained, ""Gaza [...] would become like Singapore [including] the construction of an airport, a seaport, and economic projects in Gaza"" in return for which Hamas would recognize Israelâs right to exist, ""disband the military wings and incorporate them into the police force"" Haniyeh said ""naturally, we completely rejected that offer"" preferring to hold on to Hamasâ ""political principles, resistance, [and] weapons.""Â 

When asked what these political principles were, he made it clear that the annihilation of Israel was his core agenda: ""We will not recognize Israel, Palestine must stretch from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea, the Right of Return [must be granted], the prisoners must be set free, and a fully sovereign Palestinian state must be established with Jerusalem as its capital.""

In a public address in May 2021, Haniyeh praising three of the most important Hamas figures behind the October 7 attack, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Al-Deif and Marwan Issa, for launching the attacks on Israel during the 2021 Gaza crisis,Â saying:

""â¦my greetings to the resistance and its leadership in Gaza, foremost among them, my dear brother, the gallant Yahya Sinwar [â¦] and the leader, the mujahid, my dear friend, Mohammed Deif, this brave hero, this blessed man, who is known by millions [even though] they have not seen his face, but they chant his name because Allah has elevated his nameâ¦and Marwan Issa and the [other] pillars of the resistance [who are with him, i.e. Deif] because of his sincerity, selflessness, humility and love of Jihad.""

At a press-conference in January 2006, Haniyeh eulogized IRGC-Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani, saying:

""[â¦] the martyr and leader Soleimani â who spent his life supporting the resistance [i.e. Hamas] as the head of the Quds Force in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard â because of everything he has done, [he] is a martyr for Jerusalem. He is a martyr for Jerusalem, he is a martyr for Jerusalem!""

In the same address, Haniyeh praised the Islamic Republic of Iran for military support during 2021Gaza Crisis,Â saying:

""[â¦] and I must thank those who provided money and weaponry to the valiant resistance. The Islamic Republic of Iran, who did not hold back on money, weapons and technical support.""

Addressing a conference in Tehran on the occasion of Quds Day, 2024, Haniyeh praised Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini,Â saying:

""First, we remember on this great day Imam Khomeini,Â may Allah have mercy on him. [â¦] He called for Jerusalem Day so that the nation rises to its duty and unifies its forces to liberate Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa from the clutches of the usurping Zionist occupation.

Haniyeh also praised the Islamic Republic of Iranâs ""Axis of Resistance"" and affirmed Hamasâ role within it: â[T]his blessed battle has united the ranks of the nationâs children, and the greatest scene of this unity has been manifested in the arenas and fronts from Palestine to Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, with the support and backing of the Islamic Republic of Iran.""","[2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.5, 2: 0.8, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.7, 5: 0.1, 6: 0.9}",HIGH

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/targeting-hillel-antisemites-and-anti-israel-activists-push-undermine-jewish-life,"Hillel International, the premier Jewish on-campus organization that supports Jewish life at hundreds of colleges across the United States and abroad, has been one of the most frequent targets of anti-Israel activists and other antisemites in recent months, totaling more than a hundred incidents in the U.S. since Hamasâs October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Jewish students and Hillel staff members have received threatening emails and phone calls; Hillel buildings have been vandalized and tagged with graffiti; and Hillel-sponsored events have been protested; and in some cases, anti-Israel student groups have even launched campaignsÂ demanding that Hillel be banned entirely from universities.

Most recently, on July 19, 2024, an anti-Zionist student group at the University of Wisconsin, MilwaukeeÂ posted a message on social media declaring that âANY organization or entity that supports Israel is not welcome at UWM,â calling out Hillel and the Jewish Federation by name. The post went on to ominously state that these organizations âwill be treated accordingly as extremist criminals. Stay tuned.â

The university administrationÂ quickly denounced the threatening language, but UW-Milwaukee Popular University for Palestine â the group that published the original post and also served as a key organizer of theÂ anti-Israel encampment at the school earlier in the spring â doubled down on its rhetoric in a follow-up post that reiterated that Zionist groups âwill not be normalized or welcomed on our campus.â The groupâs statement was endorsed by UW-Milwaukeeâs chapters ofÂ Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and others.

The university has since temporarily suspended the SJP chapter and those of SDS and YDSA.

This extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric that seeks to target and marginalize mainstream Jewish organizations reflects a concerning trend that has taken hold across the United States since October 7. This sentiment has manifested in direct actions against the American Jewish community on the ground and online. College campuses, in particular, have been aÂ hotbed of antisemitic rhetoric and activity.Â 

Antisemitic Targeting of Hillel-Affiliated Individuals and Property


Since October, antisemites and others have frequently targeted members of the Hillel community or Hillel property. The ADL Center on Extremism has tallied incidents on dozens of US campuses over the past 10 months.

Many of these incidents have included references to the Israel-Hamas war, engaged in a classic antisemitic practice of holding Jewish people around the world accountable for the actions of the State of Israel.Â 

On October 13, an individual on a bike yelled, âFuck the Jewsâ as he passed students marking Shabbat in the front yard of Hillel at the University of California, Davis. At Ohio State University on November 9,Â two individuals entered the Hillel building, vandalized two Israeli flags that were on display in the lobby, and yelled expletives and anti-Israel statements at staff.Â 

On February 2, Jewish students eating Shabbat dinner at the Ohio State University Hillel were interrupted when other students allegedly began banging on the windows and shouting, âFree Palestine.â At the University of California, Riverside on February 16, an individual entered the Hillel building and harassed students, yelling, âFree Palestine,â âFuck the IDFâ and âYou are terrorists.â

Hillel employees and Hillel-affiliated accounts haveÂ frequently received threatening and conspiratorial notes via email, phone, text message and social media since October 7, often referencing Israel or other common antisemitic slogans.Â

Â 

A week after Hamasâs attack, Jewish students and Hillel staff members at Miami University in Oxford, OH received antisemitic emails that stated, âThe best Jew is a dead Jew.âÂ 

Later in October, Hillel employees in multiple states received antisemitic emails stating, âIsrael did 9/11.â In November, a Jewish student at the University of Texas at Dallas received anonymous antisemitic and anti-Zionist text messages that included comments such as, âDeath to Jews.â In January, staff from Hillel and the Office of Jewish Life at Lehigh University and Lafayette College in Pennsylvania received several harassing messages, including one that threatened to bring members of Hamas to campus.

Also in January, at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, the Hillel chapter received an email that read: âIn the name of the innocent Palestinian women and children who have been raped and murdered en masse by the Satanic U.S.-backed IDF, I will be shooting any and all Jewish students and/or teachers I can find on campus.â At the University of Denver, a Hillel employee received a threatening antisemitic text message that included âI will not feel guilty sending you all back in time to die in the holocaust [sic].âÂ 

âFree Palestineâ graffiti discovered at the University of California, Riverside Hillel on November 7, 2023 (left; source: reported to ADL) and at the Texas Hillel building at the University of Texas, Austin on March 13, 2024. (right; source: Instagram).Â Â 

Â 

Hillel buildings have also beenÂ frequently vandalized with similar antisemitic and anti-Zionist messages and some have beenÂ tagged with slogans like âFree Palestineâ and âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.â

Posters, signs and other displays on Hillel property commemorating those who were killed or kidnapped on October 7 have been defaced and damaged. In February, an antisemitic flier was placed on the University of Virginia Hillel that included the words: âGo back to Europe, Free Palestine.âÂ 

Campaigns and Protests Seeking to Ban Hillel from Campuses


Calls to ban Hillel are in effect calls to fundamentally undercut Jewish life on campus for students and community members. These demands emerged earlier in 2024 and,Â as previously reported by ADL, became increasingly prevalent during the wave of anti-Israel student encampments that began in April.

In some cases, demonstrations in support of these explicitly antisemitic demands have been coupled with antisemitic tropes and imagery.Â 

In late February, anti-Israel protesters at Hunter College, part of the City University of New York (CUNY) system,Â held a protest to declare âZionist donors and financiers out of Jewish campus life.â In announcing the protest, organizers â including Not In Our Name (NION) CUNY,Â Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) Barnard/Columbia, Palestine Solidarity Alliance (PSA) of Hunter College, Jews Against Zionism at NYU, and others â wrote: âHillel International has played a critical role in indoctrinating Jewish youths into Zionism and distorting values of Jewish communityâ¦We call upon New York City Jewish students, alumni, staff, and faculty, to join us in raising our voices against this insidious multi-billion-dollar project and to join the call in divesting from Zionism, standing in solidarity with Palestine, and building new Jewish campus spaces free from racist violence.â

At the protest, demonstrators addressed Hunter Collegeâs Jewish community, chanting: âJews on campus pick a side!â These chants echoed age-old antisemitic tropesÂ accusing Jews of disloyalty.Â 

At the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) in March, anti-Israel students and facultyÂ protested a âJewish Unity Walkâ hosted by the schoolâs chapters of Hillel, Chabad, Alpha Epsilon Pi, and StandWithUs. Protest organizers stated: âLetâs make it clearâ¦zionism [sic] is not welcome on our campus.â

This declaration was emphasized later in the spring when the UCSC SJP chapter and other groups launched an encampment on May 1 and explicitlyÂ called for UCSC to âcut tiesâ with Hillel. Jews Against White Supremacy (JAWS) at UCSC and Faculty for Justice in Palestine (FJP) at UCSC reiterated this demand in a lengthy Instagram post on May 9 under the headline âWhy universities must cut ties with Hillel.â

Â 

Similar demands were made by students at the School of Visual Arts in New York, NY. When they began a sit-in at the universityâs administrative building on May 2, the schoolâs SJP chapterÂ demanded that the university âcut ties with Hillel International and any other Zionist institutions.â

The SJP chapter disparaged Hillel as âan explicitly Zionist clubâ and attacked the organization for facilitating Jewish studentsâ travel to Israel via the Birthright program. In another published statement, sit-in organizers reaffirmed: âWe demand that the school doesnât foster a space for zionist [sic] organizations such as Hillel.â

At Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA, students launched an encampment on May 18 and demanded that the university âimmediately terminate Drexel's chapter of Hillel, a global zionist [sic] campus organization,â as well as Drexelâs chapter of Chabad, another Jewish campus organization. The list of demands further stated that these âorganizations must be replaced by non-zionist [sic] Jewish ones that in no way support the ongoing genocide, occupation, or apartheid in Palestine or are funded by such.â

Similarly, when University of Pittsburgh anti-Israel students relaunched an encampment on June 2, theyÂ explicitly called for the university to âREJECT the normalization of ties with the Zionist regime. Namely, CANCEL all official partnerships with organizations promoting the normalization of apartheid and occupation. Immediately terminate Pittâs chapter of Hillel.â

On June 5, anti-Israel student groups across several New York City universitiesÂ held a âRally against Hillelâ at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York (CUNY) system, to declare âno fascists on campus.â Co-sponsors included SJP at Baruch College, SJP at FIT, CUNY for Palestine, Not In Our Name (NION) CUNY, CUNY Gaza Solidarity Encampment, Palestine Solidarity Alliance (PSA) of Hunter College,Â Within Our Lifetime (WOL) and others. The protest announcement stated: âAs part of the CGSEâs [CUNY Gaza Solidarity Encampmentâs] 5 Demands, we demand CUNY sever its partnerships with Hillel International for its direct complicity in genocide in Gaza.â

Â 

Both on social media and in person, protesters insertedÂ inverted red triangle imagery (which since October 7 has frequently been used to glorify Hamas violence against Israel and Zionists) into the Hillel logo alongside the slogan, âIt is right to rebel; Hillel go to hell!â Protesters were also seen wearing headbands bearing the logos of U.S.-designated terror groupsÂ Hamas and theÂ Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP); chanting slogans like âHillel, Hillel, what do you say? How many kids did you kill today?â; and carrying a banner depicting antisemitic imagery of a swastika inside a Star of David.

Protests Against Hillel-Sponsored Events and Related Actions


Numerous Hillel-sponsored events on college campuses have been disrupted by anti-Israel activists since October 7. In many cases, protesters sought to harass or silence Jewish speakers â even when the speakersâ remarks were not focused on Israel.Â 

For example, on February 29 at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC, anti-Israel studentsÂ protested a Hillel-hosted eventÂ sponsored by the universityâs Division of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusive Excellence. Protesters stood outside the room where the event â an âAsk Me Anythingâ session with a deaf rabbi who lives in Israel â was taking place, chanting slogans like âWe want justice you say how; Zionists off our campus now!â

A protest leader affiliated with Maryland 2 PalestineÂ told the crowd outside the Gallaudet event: âWe have a responsibility to plan more protests, to show up at every disgusting Hillel event!â That same speaker added, âI donât have the ability to be friends with Zionistsâ¦Thereâs no neutrality here. Thereâs [sic] no two sides. Thereâs one side â one right side â and one wrong side. And all of you here are on the right side. Everyone whoâs hiding in there [indicating the room in which the Hillel event was taking place] is on the wrong side.â As individuals who had attended the Hillel event left the room, protesters harassed them, shouting âShame on you!â

Â 

On April 4,Â SJP members and others protested a Hillel-hosted event at the University of California, Riverside featuring transgender Israeli man Michael Alroy to speak about âgender identity and Judaism.â Protesters highlighted Alroyâs past Israeli military service, with SJP UCR writing on social media ahead of the protest: âUCR Hillel is bringing Michael Alroy, a known former IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier to our campus, and utilizing this event to pinkwash a genocide.â

On May 3, anti-Zionist student protesters at New York University (NYU) and other NYC schools announced a protest designed to coincide with the Hillel-sponsored âShabbat for 2000,â an annual on-campus Shabbat dinner that brings together thousands of students, alumni, and other community members. The protesters initially planned to gather directly outside the building where the Hillel Shabbat was taking place but relocated at the last minute apparently due to NYPD blocking certain streets.

Hillel-sponsored events related to October 7 or the ongoing Israel-Hamas war have also been frequent protest targets, with protesters often harassing the Hillel members and Jewish students attending these events.Â 

Anti-Israel students at the University of PittsburghÂ protested a Hillel-hosted event on January 24 featuring Yadin Gellman, an IDF veteran and Israeli actor, shouting âfucking Zionistsâ at attendees. Afterward, protest organizers SJP at Pitt, the Pittsburgh Palestine Coalition, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) Pittsburgh chapter thanked those who had joined their protest and declared on social media: âWe cannot allow the genocidal zionist [sic] regime to be normalized here in Pittsburgh or anywhere!â

On February 15, anti-Israel studentsÂ protested an event featuring an October 7 survivor sponsored by Hillel, Chabad, and Students Supporting Israel at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. Protesters stood outside the room where the event took place, chanting slogans like âThere is only one solution; Intifada, revolutionâ and âIntifada, Intifada; Long live the Intifada.â

After the protest, the universityâs SJP chapter released a statement doubling down on its support for terror and its explicit call for the exclusion of Zionists from campus. The KU SJP statement read, in part: âIt should be clear: just as âisraelâ has no right to exist, Zionism has no right to be on KUâs campusâ¦Just as Palestinians have a right to resist our oppressors in Palestine, so too do we have a right to resist them when they show their faces right here at KU. Here as much as in Palestine, be sure that the resistance will never cease until Palestine is freed from the river to the sea. Glory to the martyrs! Glory to the Resistance! Long live the Intifada!â

On March 6, a Hillel-sponsored event featuring an IDF soldier at The New School in New York, NY wasÂ forced to relocate multiple times due toÂ anti-Israel protesters. Protesters harassed Hillel members as they entered and exited the venue and left red-painted handprints on the glass doors of the building.

Two days later,Â protesters disrupted an on-campus, Hillel-hosted Shabbat dinner featuring two IDF soldiers at Florida International University in Miami, FL. Protesters were eventually removed from the building, but remained outside the exits, with Jewish students reporting that they wereÂ harassed and intimidated as they left the event.

Even Hillel-hosted events seeking to facilitate dialogue related to the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been targeted by anti-Israel student activists who are increasingly employing anÂ anti-normalization approach â the complete rejection of any cooperation or association with individuals or organizations who accept or support Israelâs existence.

A âSide-By-Sideâ discussion at Ithaca College on February 6 featuring an Israeli and Palestinian speaker and hosted by Hillel was protested by Ithaca College Students for Palestine, whoÂ staged a sit-in outside the campus building where the event took place.

On March 27, three masked individuals stood in front of the Ohio State University Hillel building in Columbus, OHÂ holding a banner that read âOSU Hillel invites you to visit a genocidal state.â The demonstration coincided with a scheduled informational session for an upcoming âFact Finders Israel Trip,â a Hillel-run program that facilitates dialogue between Jewish and non-Jewish students via a trip to Israel and the West Bank.Â 

Protesters also entered the building apparently intending to disrupt the info session, which was postponed due to the demonstration.","[1, 2, 4, 6]","{1: 0.8, 2: 0.9, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.0, 6: 0.7}",HIGH
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-reddit-help-moderators-confronted-antisemitism,"New York, NY, August 1, 2024 ... A new report released today by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society (CTS) reveals that a group of moderators of Jewish communities on Reddit faced with increased antisemitism on the social media platform reached out to ADL for support. Based on research into these moderatorsâ experiences, ADL engaged with Reddit, which led the platform to take several important steps to stem instances of antisemitism on the site and to support moderators.

These steps include:

Provide refresher training to safety staff on Reddit policies around hate, including antisemitism.
Include identity communities, including Jewish community representatives, in theirÂ Partner Communities Program.
StartÂ Moderator Code of ConductÂ proceedings on interference with some Jewish communities.
Review safety settings and supported moderators in enabling tools on their subreddits, such as theÂ Modmail Harassment FilterÂ and theÂ Harassment Filter.Â 

âThe way ADL worked with Reddit to address the antisemitism described by moderators is a great example of a tech company working with civil society to improve their platform and make it a safer place for its users,âÂ said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âWe are grateful to Redditâs leadership who took the concerns of their community seriously and acted quickly to make sure the hate and harassment experienced by Jewish users would not be accepted or normalized.â

The alarming wave of hate that Reddit moderators have faced since Oct. 7 is part of an increaseÂ observed online and offline hate globally. In the U.S., the number ofÂ antisemitic incidents leapt by 140 percent in 2023 andÂ 41 percent of Jewish adults reported changing their behavior online in the past year to avoid being recognized as Jewish.

In a subreddit where people shared about their trauma dealing with antisemitism, for example, bad actors purposefully looked for these opportunities to harass users and spread hate. Other moderators explained that they deal with slurs, footage of Oct. 7, hate speech, and blood libel, among other hateful rhetoric and acts.

This has taken a toll on the moderators themselves, not only from having to manage the perpetual hate, but also from having to deal with harassment directed at themselves. So much of their time is spent keeping the space safe that they cannot participate in the communities they love.

Moderators also face steady personal and targeted harassment from users. This antisemitism hasÂ had a chilling effect on speech for the moderators and those on their subreddits,Â and the response to antisemitism reports on the site has stopped at least one moderator from reporting instances of antisemitism.

âJewish subreddits provide usersÂ with a space to talk about their unique experiences, which has taken on an increased importance since Oct. 7. The moderators we spoke with, however, describe a situation where even these safe spaces have become inundated with an antisemitism they constantly have to keep in check,â said DanielÂ Kelley, Director of Strategy and Operations and Interim Head, ADL Center for Technology and Society. âThe challenge for Reddit and all platforms is to continue to address antisemitism and keep online spaces safe for Jewish users. Itâs not enough to only remove violative content- platforms must find ongoing ways to support targeted users on their platform directly and continually educate their staff on what that looks like. Reddit was receptive and proactive when alerted.""

Methodology

ADL was contacted by six Jewish Reddit moderators looking for support handling theÂ antisemitism on their subreddits. On March 20, 2024, we conducted a 90-minute group interview with these moderators to discuss this antisemitism and the interventions that Reddit has, or has not, taken to support them. The six moderators came from a variety of Jewish-focused subreddits who have, by their own estimate, an average of 78,000 subscribers, and receive approximately 50 posts and 1,400 comments per subreddit per day. All names of the moderators have been anonymized in our report. Minimal reference to their personal information (age, gender, etc.) or to the subreddits they moderate has been made to protect them from harassment.Â  Â Â

Today, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) launched the first of thirty âWords to Actionâ antisemitism education trainings at the European Maccabi Youth Games in London.Â 

Equipping young Jewish athletes with the tools to respond to antisemitism in everyday life as well as in the sports arena, these sessions will be delivered to over 800 Jewish teen athletes participating in the popular sporting event, often referred to as the âJewish Olympics.â

âThe disturbing displays of antisemitism we have seen leading up to and during major national and international sporting events, including the recent Olympic Games, reflect a broader issue present in sports around the world. In this yearâs âJewish Olympicsâ at the European Maccabi Youth Games, we seized the opportunity to provide young Jewish athletes with the knowledge and tools to empower them to address antisemitism head-on. Sports should be a catalyst for unity; there is no place for hate on the fieldâ said Marina Rosenberg, Senior Vice President for International Affairs at ADL.

âWe are delighted to welcome the ADL to deliver their Words to Action programme to our EMYG participants. The work that the ADL is doing across Europe to raise awareness around antisemitism is so important at this moment in time, and we feel privileged to be able to offer our athletes the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in this educational experience,â said Nathan Servi, Chief Operating Officer at Maccabi GB.

In response to the recent sharp global rise of antisemitic attitudes and antisemitic incidents, âWords to Actionâ has become a highly sought-after educational program for Jewish youth to understand and effectively address antisemitism, anti-Israel bias, stereotypes, prejudice, and hate speech. As part of theÂ Words to Action Europe program, ADL has delivered 176 trainings for over 2,700 Jewish youth since 2022.

Thirty educational sessions will be provided to approximately 800 young athletes from 14 countries, including Argentina, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/hillel-international-adl-ajc-jewish-federations-and-cop-urge-colleges-and,"Following the alarming rise in antisemitic incidents on campus, leading Jewish and educational groups call on college and university administrators to take action ahead of the new school year.

July 31, 2024â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), American Jewish Committee (AJC), the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations (CoP), Hillel International, and Jewish Federations of North America today announced a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at combating antisemitism on campus in the upcoming school year.

This unprecedented time for institutions of higher education across the United States demands a unified response to ensure the safety and full inclusion of Jewish students â as well as all students, faculty, and staff. These guidelines provide college and university administrators with clear and proactive ways to support a safer and more inclusive campus environment for Jewish students, and for the entire campus community.

Recommendations include:

Clearly Communicate Campus Rules, Standards, and Policies:Â Make clear to students what it means to be a member of the campus community, and ensure students, faculty, and staff are aware of school policies on protests and demonstrations.
Support Jewish Students:Â Prevent discrimination, unequivocally denounce antisemitism, ensure inclusivity, and provide antisemitism education and training.
Ensure Campus Safety: Enforce university codes of conduct, maintain clear reporting avenues for antisemitic incidents, ensure campus staff are trained to address violations ofÂ  campus rules, and reaffirm rejection of BDS and academic boycotts of Israel.
Reaffirm Faculty Responsibilities: Ensure studentsâ academic freedom and a non-discriminatory learning environment in the classroom. Communicate and enforce policies regarding faculty who threaten to withhold studentsâ grades if faculty demands are not met, or who cancel mandatory classes.
Prepare for Oct. 7:Â Anticipate and mitigate disruptions on the one-year mark of the Hamas attack on Israel, ensuring any protest activities do not interfere with campus operations or Jewish studentsâ rights.

âThe unprecedented surge in antisemitism on college campuses last year was utterly unacceptable, and yet far too many administrations failed to respond effectively,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âWe insist that all college and university leaders take significant steps to make Jewish students safer.â

âDuring the last academic year, countless Jewish students experienced harassment, intimidation, discrimination, and even assaults on campus,â said Adam Lehman, Hillel International President and CEO. âAlongside our efforts to build vibrant Jewish communities on campus, we are providing college and university leaders with clear guidance and practical solutions for the steps they need to take to ensure a safer and more welcoming environment for Jewish students. Jewish students and all students deserve a better campus and learning environment this fall.â

During the 2023-2024 academic year, schools saw more than 1,400 antisemitic incidents on college campuses â by far the highest number of antisemitic incidents on campus in a single school year ever on record. Following the Oct. 7 attack, aÂ survey by Hillel and ADL found that 73 percent of Jewish college students and 44 percent of non-Jewish students experienced or witnessed antisemitism on their campuses last fall. A fall 2023Â survey by AJC found that 1 in 4 Jewish college/university students felt unsafe at a campus event because they were Jewish.

âWhat Jewish students faced on campus last year cannot be allowed to continue into the new academic year,â said AJC CEO Ted Deutch. âAll students on campus have the right to attend class, learn and grow without intimidation, harassment and even violence at the hands of fellow students and outside agitators. Colleges and universities must do the work to ensure a university culture of pluralism, fact-based inquiry, and dialogue across difference. They must ensure a campus and societal culture where there is zero tolerance for antisemitism.â

âOur campuses should be bastions of diversity and the open exchange of ideas rather than be pervaded by fear, intimidation, and discrimination,â said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of Jewish Federations of North America. âWith this agenda, Jewish Federations across North America are working to ensure that every community's institutions of higher learning will take action to protect the civil rights of their Jewish students.â

ï»¿âOver the past school year, America saw numerous incidents of harassment against Jewish students, violent protests, and flagrant violations of conduct codes. University officials are neglecting their duty to ensure a safe learning environment for all students,â said William Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. âWe urge them to adopt these recommendations and collaborate with Jewish organizations to protect the safety of Jewish students.â

Additional supporting organizations include Academic Engagement Network, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Jewish Grad Organization, Jewish on Campus, National Council of Jewish Women, Olami, Rabbinical Assembly, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Delta Tau, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and Zeta Beta Tau.

Â 

Dear High Commissioner TÃ¼rk,Â Â 

Â 
We, the undersigned, representing the largest Jewish communities outside of Israel, write to you today regarding United Nations Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese.Â  Ms. Albanese has a long record of promoting antisemitic conspiracies and using of hateful and violent language to attack the Jewish State of Israel.Â Â 

Â 

The most recent example is her July 25th post on the social media platform X, which promoted an image that compared Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, with the comment âThis is precisely what I was thinking today.â Making comparisons between Israel and the Nazis is one explicit example of antisemitism in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism and is unambiguously considered antisemitic by the Jewish community.Â  Her post trivializes the memory of the Holocaust and the six million Jews killed, promotes antisemitism, and emboldens others to voice their anti-Jewish hate.Â 

Â 

Prior examples of Ms. Albaneseâs antisemitic comments and other problematic posts include:Â 

Â 

Repeated comments about how the US government is controlled by a Jewish lobby, a classic antisemitic stereotype about Jews controlling governments.Â 

Diminishing the horrific Hamas attack against Israel on October 7th and blaming Israel for Hamasâs atrocities.

Repeatedly defending Hamas and advocating for Palestinian âresistance,â views which amount to support for violence against Israel and Jews.Â 
Â 

Ms. Albaneseâs pattern of antisemitism, her clear bias against Israel, and justification of and even supportÂ Â  for violence stand in direct opposition to the United Nationsâs values of peace and tolerance. She is clearly ill-suited for any official UN role, let alone one that deals with a highly complex and sensitive matter like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Â Â 

Â 

We therefore respectfully request that you initiate a process at the upcoming UN Human Rights Council session in September to remove Ms. Albanese from her Special Rapporteur position.Â  As you know, the Human Rights Council has long had a reputation for tolerating antisemitism and bias against Israel.Â  If you, as High Commissioner, were to successfully drive a process to have the Human Rights Council withdraw Ms. Albaneseâs mandate, that action would contribute to the rehabilitation of the Councilâs reputation.Â  By the same token, lack of action would further harm the Councilâs standing and would add yet another example of toleration of antisemitism within the UN system.Â Â 

Â 

Â 

We look forward to your early reply.Â Â Â

Sincerely,Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-files-title-vi-complaint-against-school-district-philadelphia-charging,"Complaint: âVirulent wave of antisemitismâ swept through Philadelphia schools after Oct. 7


New York, NY, July 23, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), represented pro bono by the law firm Mayer Brown LLP, today filed a federal civil rights complaint on behalf of Jewish parents whose children have been subjected to âsevere and persistent harassment and discriminationâ at the hands of fellow students and teachers in the School District of Philadelphia (SDP).

The Title VI complaint, filed with the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights, alleges that over the past nine months since Oct. 7, the Philadelphia school district has knowingly allowed its grade K through 12 schools to become âviciously hostileâ environments for Jewish students, while failing to address numerous incidents of antisemitic harassment, bullying, and discrimination.

Immediately after the 10/7 Hamas massacre on Israel, âa virulent wave of antisemitism swept through its schools,â the complaint states. And ever since then, Jewish students have been subjected to openly antisemitic bullying and harassment by teachers and peers in hallways, in classrooms and online.

âSince the October 7 attack, the Philadelphia Schools have fostered a toxic environment that has allowed antisemitism against Jewish students to metastasize and fester without repercussions,â said James Pasch, ADL Senior Director of National Litigation. âWhatâs worse, the district has encouraged a rampant culture of retaliation and fear that has prevented Jewish parents and students from coming forward.â

According to the ADL complaint, Jewish parents have regularly reported a host of troubling incidents affecting their children to the SDP administration, but the district has done virtually nothing to address the hostile environment. In fact, the complaint notes, students and parents who have reported antisemitic incidents have themselves faced blatant retaliation.

âPhiladelphia schools have a long history of providing a safe and welcoming environment for students of all identities. However, in the recent past â and especially in the aftermath of October 7thÂ âÂ we've seen a stark rise in incidents and attitudes that alienate Jewish students, faculty and families,â said Andrew Goretsky, ADL Philadelphia Regional Director. âJewish students faceÂ a shameful and pervasive litany of antisemitic harassment from their peers, and teachers and administrators, the professionals tasked with our childrenâs education. This pattern is dangerous, completely unacceptable, and needs to stop now.â

Some examples of incidents outlined in the complaint include:

Â 

An eighth-grade Jewish student at an SDP school who was severely bullied by a fellow student who approached him and said, âf--- youâ and âfree Palestine;â the following day the student was again approached with similar comments, and later the victim was confronted with taunts including, âPraise Hitlerâ and a Nazi salute. The response from the school was so inadequate that the student was forced to drop out of the district.
Â 
A fourth-grade Jewish student at the Penn Alexander School who was bullied both in the hallways (with demands that she say âFree Palestineâ), and virtually (with a computer quiz that asked âWhat do we hate?,â with the âtwo right answer[s]â being âIsrael and Pork.â).
Â 
The appearance of swastikas at multiple schools in the SDP, including Masterman, Southwark School, Swenson Arts & Technology High School, and George Washington High School.
Â 
On Halloween, just weeks after October 7, a student at Masterman came to school dressed as a Palestinian freedom fighter and attempted to drape a Palestinian flag over a Jewish student. The principal of the school then publicly praised the costume.
Â 
The erasure of Israel from a map handed out in a geography class at Baldi Middle School.Â 
Â 
Several SDP teachers and administrators have used their platform within the district to distribute antisemitic content, including professional development classes and lectures in which âZionistsâ were referred to as âexterminators,â and to create a hostile environment for Jewish students. Among other things, these SDP teachers have also used their publicly available social media feeds â which are a virtual extension of their classrooms â to spread hateful antisemitic tropes, as well as virulently anti-Israel and anti-âZionistâ messages.


The complaint urges the U.S. Dept. of Education to appoint an independent investigator to examine the school climate. It also calls for the district to take a series of proactive steps to protect Jewish and Israeli students, and to ensure that members of the school community are held accountable for harassment or discriminatory conduct.

âIt is profoundly disheartening to witness such unbridled and pervasive hatred towards Jews manifesting within the public schools of Philadelphia,â stated members of the steering committee of the School District of Philadelphiaâs Jewish Family Association. âWhile our country is far from flawless, it is rooted in principles that enable our ongoing growth and evolution. No individual should endure the torrents of animosity, vitriol, violence, and baseless accusations that have been directed at our Jewish students, exacerbated by the very educators and administrators entrusted with their safety. The pursuit of inclusivity and equity, safeguarding all minorities, including Jews, from the scourge of hatred, is an inviolable cornerstone that must never be compromised.â

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin, including discrimination against Jews on the basis of their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding.Â  Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful.

Since Oct. 7, ADL has filed several similar civil rights and legal complaints against other public school districts for creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, including theÂ Berkeley Unified School District and theÂ Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD).

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/samidoun-what-you-need-know,"Introduction

Anti-Zionist group Samidoun (derived from the Arabic word for âsteadfastâ) is a self-described solidarity network for Palestinian inmates in Israeli prisons. In October 2024, the U.S. and Canadian governments sanctioned Samidoun as a ""sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for The Popular Front for The Liberation of Palestine"" (PFLP), a designated terror group in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Israel, and Japan.

On October 15, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury added Samidoun to the Office of Foreign Assets Controlâs Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN List) after determining that Samidounâ¯is owned, controlled, directed by, or has acted for or on behalf of the PFLP.

The Department also added Khaled Barakat, a member of the PFLPâs leadership and among Samidoun's leaders, to the SDN List for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the PFLP. The Departmentâs designations allow the U.S. government to block the assets of entities and individuals that provide support, services, or assistance to, or otherwise associate with, terrorists and terrorist organizations, as well as their subsidiaries, front organizations, agents, and associates. Financial institutions and individuals who engage in certain transactions or activities with sanctioned entities and individuals may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties as well as other enforcement actions.

Canada -- where Samidoun maintains its offices -- also added the group to its list of terror entities under the Canadian criminal code.

Israel designated Samidoun as a terror organization and an arm of the PFLP in 2021. Germany banned Samidoun's operations in October 2023, following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.

Samidoun first emerged in 2011 following a coordinated hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners led by the PFLP. Its chapters in the U.S., Canada and other Western countries have campaigned on behalf of Palestinians imprisoned in those nations, including those arrested or convicted for alleged involvement in terror activity or âdirect actions"" for Palestinians.

Samidoun also operates a chapter in Iran.

Samidounâs ideology and leadership

The organization has routinely touted its explicit support for those convicted or accused of terrorism and acts related to terrorism, like PFLPâs Walid Daqqa and Rasmea Odeh, making it among more extreme groups within the Palestinian activist movement in the lead-up to its U.S. designation.

A Samidoun banner with the slogan âLong live October 7th."" (Source: Telegram)

Â 

In protests, articles, webinars and other events, Samidoun has praised the October 7 attack, supported the full ostracization of âZionistsâ, claimed that âZionist forcesâ have âno soulâ and demanded the end of the âZionist project.â The organization has also supported the activities of organizations like the Houthis, a US-designated Yemen-based terror group also known as âAnsar Allahâ, or âsupporters of God,â and backed by the Iranian regime.

Samidoun encourages engagement with the radical antisemitic, anti-Zionist English-language Telegram channelÂ Resistance News Network (RNN), which regularly features pro-Hamas propaganda and violent anti-Israel imagery. In 2024, the group sponsored two webinars with Hamas officials including Husam Badran, a Hamas spokesperson, and Ghazi Hamad, a senior member of Hamasâs political leadership.

Charlotte Kates, Samidounâs Canada-based international coordinator, also claims to have held meetings in South Africa with local government ministers and representatives of Hamasâs leadership, including Basem Naim, as well as Palestinian Islamic Jihad officials. These meetings took place before South Africa filed its case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in late 2023 accusing Israel of genocide

In early August 2024, Kates traveled to Tehran to accept a ""human rights"" award from the Iranian regime, an accolade that was also bestowed on the secretary-general of terror group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran in late July 2024, was also honored at the event.

Â 

Another prominent Samidoun leader is Khaled Barakat, a campaign coordinator who was born and raised in Jerusalem and became an active member of the PFLP. He is also Katesâs spouse. In interviews, Barakat has indicated that he moved to the US with his family as a child, living there for over a decade before relocating to Canada, where he and Kates now reside in the Vancouver area and where Samidoun was registered as a non-profit organization. He has also stated that he has lived in Lebanon.

In 2020, Barakat and Kates were deported from Germany and subject to a four-year ban. Two years later, the pair was denied entry to the Netherlands for a speaking event.

Barakat sometimes makes media appearances while in Beirut and has written for the pro-Assad and pro-Hezbollah Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar.

Â 

In addition to Samidoun, Barakat is one of the founding leaders of Masar Badil, also known as the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement, an extreme anti-Zionist international organization that hosts members of US-designated terror organizations including Hamas and the Houthis for webinars. Samidoun frequently cooperates with Masar Badil, sharing its events on Samidoun-run social media pages quite often.

Other Samidoun leaders include Mustapha Awad and Mohammed Khatib, both European coordinators for the group. Awad and Khatib are also believed to be affiliated with the PFLP and both reside in Belgium. In April 2024, the Belgian Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration called on immigration authorities to revoke Khatibâs refugee status, describing him âas an extremist hate preacher.â

In October 2024, Khatib was denied entry to the Netherlands for a speaking event at a university. In their statement announcing the ban, the Dutch ministers of justice and immigration said Khatib ""legitimizes, condones and glorifies violence against the state of Israel, including violence by organizations on the European Unionâs terrorism list,"" and ""actively expresses support for terrorist organizations.""

Funding

Samidoun is a fiscally sponsored project of the Alliance for Global Justice (AFJG), an Arizona-based organization that serves as a fiscal sponsor for a number of progressive and left-wing initiatives, including the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI).

A fiscal sponsor uses its 501c3 status to act as a passthrough for donations to sponsored projects. This can allow sponsored groups to be less transparent with respect to their funding.

Support for the October 7 terror attacksÂ Â 

When the news broke of Hamasâs terror attack on October 7, Samidoun released an effusive statement in support of armed âPalestinian resistance,"" including explicitly praising Hamasâ invasion of Israeli towns and the abduction of civilians to use as hostages.

Â 

Alongside the statement, Samidoun posted an image of individuals carrying weapons and added, in part: âThe resistance is rising throughout occupied Palestine, smashing the siege on Gazaâ¦as Palestinian resistance forces fight to advance return and the liberation of Palestine.â

Since October 7, the group has repeatedly endorsed the mass terror attack, and similar rhetoric has been seen at events facilitated or co-sponsored by Samidoun.Â 

At a June 10, 2024 rally in New York City, a flag was seen bearing the Samidoun logo with the slogan âlong live October 7.â At the same rally, a Samidoun banner can be seen prominently next to a Hezbollah flag.

Â 

Also in June 2024, Samidoun tweeted an image that included flags and symbols of Hamasâs Al Qassamâs Brigades (the groupâs armed wing), Hamas leader and October 7 architect Yahya Sinwar,Â Hezbollah,Â the Lionâs Den, and the Houthis,Â along with their slogan, which reads in part âdeath to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews.â

Â 

In another June 2024 tweet, the organization criticized the New York Nova Exhibit, which commemorates the massacre of hundreds of innocent concertgoers by Hamas on October 7, and claimed that the exhibit was meant to ""promote false atrocity tales and a Zionist disinformation narrative, specifically, which have long been debunked.""Â Samidoun further engaged inÂ denialism of the Oct. 7 attack, claiming: âFrom the false âmass rapeâ narrative to the coverup of the IOF's âmass Hannibal eventâ, the exhibit aims to take an achievement of the resistance and smear it with vile fabrications. So yes, long live October 7, the material and symbolic representation of the road to the liberation of Palestine.... And long live the Intifada, and the revolution, until victory, return & liberation.âÂ 

In May 2024, Kates was arrested in Vancouver, Canada amid a criminal investigation into hate speech following a public appearance in which she praised the October 7 attack as âheroic and brave.â

In March 2024, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) hosted a webinar featuring Kates, Barakat and Within Our Lifetime leader Nerdeen Kiswani. Kates praised Hamas as âthe people that are on the frontlines, defending Palestine and fighting for its liberation.â She said: ""â¦ the fact is that Hamas is a mass Palestinian movement that is in a leadership role in the Liberation Struggle right now. And there is nothing wrong with being a member of Hamas, being a leader of Hamas, being a fighter in Hamas.â

Barakat praised the âtactics that the Palestinian resistance have engaged inâ, such as âhijacking airplanesâ, noting that âif it wasn't for these tactics, we would [have] never heard of Leila Khaled, for example, and other Palestinian women who led these kinds of heroic operations that introduced the Palestinian questions to the world.â Leila Khaled is a longtime active leader of the PFLP and is well-known for her role in the hijacking of two civilian airliners, TWA Flight 840 in 1969 (bound for Tel Aviv from Rome) and El Al flight 219 in 1970 (traveling from Amsterdam to New York City).

Kates and Barakat also appeared on a webinar in February 2024, co-sponsored by Samiodun, the World Workers Party and the Bronx Antiwar Coalition, on which they expressed sympathy for Hamas. In describing the ""fantastic military operation"" of October 7, Kates referred to the hostages taken by Hamas and other groups on October 7 â which included an infant, children, and elderly people â as ""prisoners of war"" with no distinction made between soldiers and civilians. Barakat claimed that Israeli hostages ""were treated as human beings.â

On the same webinar, Barakat also dehumanized Israelis, stating, ""This is a society that is fascist. The vast majority of Israelis are racist. The vast majority of Israelis are a legitimate target of the Palestinian resistance.""

Additionally, Barakat rejected the two-state solution, drawing on age-old antisemitic tropes of Jewish power by deeming it as ""a Zionist, capitalist plot to liquidate the Palestinian people struggling for their rights.""

On October 7, the New York/ New Jersey chapter of Samidoun posted a story on Instagram stating, âDecolonization is not a theory, nor a poem. Decolonization is [a] bloody and violent process focused on the main value of the colonized person: THE LAND. This is the decolonization of Palestine, and it canât be stopped. Glory to the rifle and revolution until victory.â

Â 

Even before October 7, the organization had long explicitly supported terrorism and âarmed resistance.â

At an August 2020 anti-Israel rally co-hosted by Samidoun in New York City, three protestors held Hezbollah and PFLPÂ flags. The event was also co-hosted by fellow extreme anti-Zionist groupsÂ Within Our Lifetime, Palestinian Youth Movement, NY4Palestine, and others.

In November 2021, Samidoun called on the British government to rescind its designation of Hamas as a terrorist group, arguing that âthe listing of Hamas as a âterroristâ organization not only aims to undermine the Palestinian resistance inside Palestine and anti-imperialist resistance throughout the region, it also aims to terrorize the Palestinian, Arab and Muslim communities in Britain and even supporters of justice for the Palestinian people.

In a May 2020 webinar,Â Barakat criticized non-violent activists and academics, charging that they âwant the Palestinians to pay the entire price and then provide them with a one-state solution. Well, are they engaged in this struggle of Palestinians? Do they actually join Palestinian resistance? Do they provide the money for Palestinian resistance?Â Do they carryÂ military operations along with their Palestinian comrades?Â Do they go to jail along with Palestinian comrades? Because this is the actual liberation processâ¦.â",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/far-right-influencers-x-promote-anti-zionism-hate-and-conspiracy-theories,"An analysis by the ADL Center on Extremism identified five influencers on X whose engagement spiked in the days and weeks after Hamasâs attack on Israel, with content that included virulent anti-Zionism alongside antisemitic tropes, disinformation and other forms of hateful or harmful rhetoric.

In the six months following October 7, 2023, the combined audience engagement on X for these five influencersâJackson Hinkle, Lucas Gage, Jake Shields, Sam Parker and CensoredMenâincreased by over 1070% when compared to engagement six months prior to the attacks. Engagement includes replies, reposts and quote posts.

Not all engagement is positive, or an endorsement of a posterâs views. However, increased engagement typically leads to more visibility for problematic or extremist content.

Each influencer has demonized both Zionism and Israel since October 7, and many of their related posts have been viewed tens of thousands â or even millions â of times. As users from across the political spectrum amplify content from these influencers, they boost a network of conspiracy theorists and extremists who promote overt antisemitism, anti-LGBTQ+ hate, white supremacy, foreign disinformation and more.

Influencers

Jackson Hinkle â over 2.6 million followers on XÂ 
Jackson Hinkle is a far-right commentator and influencer who has posted extensive anti-Zionist, antisemitic and anti-Israel rhetoric since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.Â Â Â 

Â 
Before October 7, Hinkle promoted fringe theories like âMAGA communismââan incoherent and poorly defined political philosophy that advocates for former president Donald Trump and his working-class followers to dismantle the so-called âglobal elites.â Hinkle has also parroted talking points from foreign disinformation propagandists, boosted conspiratorial claims about George Soros and made hateful comments toward the LGBTQ+ community.Â Â Â 

Â 
Since October 7, much of his high-engagement content has centered around demonizing Israel and Zionism. He has also gained a significant number of new followers; the New York Times reported that Hinkleâs following on X âsurged to 2.5 million from 417,000 in the six months since Oct. 7.âÂ 

Â 

Significantly, Hinkle was one of the key promoters of the narrative denying that Israeli victims were sexually assaulted during and after the October 7 attacks. He has even expressed overt support for Hamas on X, referring to the terror group as âarmed resistance.âÂ  Hinkle also celebrated Iranâs April 2024 drone and missile attack against Israel.

Â 

In one post from October 2023, which has over 18 million views and 332K likes, Hinkle shared a list of unrelated events that âtheyâ supposedly lied about, including COVID, Russia, the Ukraine war and the ongoing crisis in Gaza.

Lucas Gage â over 286K followers on X (before suspension)

Lucas Gage is a far-right, overtly antisemitic influencer who has been spreading false narratives about Jews since long before the start of the Israel-Hamas war, along with blatantly conspiratorial claims about Israel.Â 

Prior to October 7, Gage posted repeatedly on X about Holocaust denial and the dangers of âJewish supremacy,â promoting long-standing antisemitic tropes about Jews being deceitful and having a disproportionate amount of global power. Since October 7, he has used anti-Zionist terms and âlogicâ to dehumanize Zionists and Jews.Â 

In one post from December 2023âwhich garnered more than 1.7 million views and 74K likesâGage referred to Zionists as âthe scum of humanity.â In another, he called upon people to shame Zionists until âthey develop PTSD and are afraid to even leave their house,â adding that Zionists should only be found âin a ditch.âÂ 

Â

Â 

In a post from April 2024, Gage also claimed that many Zionists are pedophiles and that all Zionists are worse than pedophiles because they âblow children up.â

Â

Â 

In June 2024, Gage attended a far-right gathering in Detroit as a replacement for the 2024 America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), which was cancelled by the venue at the last minute. Led by white supremacist and antisemitic influencer Nick Fuentes, attendees included Sulaiman Ahmed, an anti-Zionist commentator and promoter of disinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war, and David Duke, white supremacist and former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.Â 
Â 
In early July 2024, Gage shared on X that he has been repeatedly swatted and harassed at his family home. He attributed this to Jews and posted videos of himself slashing the Israeli flag and burning aÂ  Jewish religious book. On July 7, Gage was reportedly suspended from X for six months. According to X Chairman and CTO Elon Musk, the suspension was triggered by Gageâs ârepeated and clear calls for violenceâ on the platform.Â Â 
Â 

Jake Shields â over 706K followers on XÂ 

Jake Shields is a former MMA fighter who has gained popularity as a far-right influencer on X since October 7. He has a history of espousing a range of hateful tropes and narratives including antisemitism, anti-Zionism, the Great Replacement theory, anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and more. Notably, Shields also attended Fuentesâs Detroit AFPAC-replacement gathering in June 2024.Â 

Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Shields has focused heavily on promoting falsehoods about Zionists, Zionism and Israelâsuggesting in one May 2024 post on X that Zionists are inherent liars who pretend to be victims of hate crimes. That post has more than 680K views and 27K likes.

Â 

In another post, which has been viewed more than 1.3 million times and has and 21K likes, Shields suggested that Jews control Americaâbased largely on the false claim that Congress is âmaking it illegal to question Jewish power.â

Â 

Sam Parker â over 141K followers on XÂ 
Sam Parker is a failed 2018 U.S. Senate candidate (Utah), conspiracy theorist and antisemite with a large social media fanbase on mainstream platforms. He posts frequently on more fringe social media platforms as wellâincluding Gab, where his content includes overtly white supremacist rhetoric and blatant antisemitism. Parker also attended Fuentesâs Detroit gathering in June 2024.

Several of Parkerâs pre-October 7 posts promote racist, xenophobic content, including conspiracy theories like the Great Replacement. In one post from September 2023, he suggested that an ethnically and racially diverse population would âtransform the country into a leftist dystopia.âÂ Â 

Â 

After October 7, Parker switched gears on X to focus on downplaying antisemitism and demonizing Zionists. In a post from November 2023âwhich has over 1.4 million views and 35K likesâParker downplayed the plight of hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas and subsequently released, suggesting that âevery hostage released is a Zionist lie debunked.â In a post from December 2023, Parker alleged that claims of antisemitism are often invalid, and that the United States should be more concerned about âAnti-White-ism.â

Â

Â 

In April of 2024, Parker posted about the so-called âZionist Occupied Media.â Tropes suggesting the presence of âZionist occupiedâ industries invoke myths about Jewish power, and are employed frequently by antisemites and white supremacists, who often use the same phrase to describe the government.

Â 

CensoredMen â more than a million followers on X

CensoredMen is an anonymous far-right account on X that has been cited by major news outlets as one of the most prominent spreaders of mis- and disinformation about the Israel-Hamas war.

Prior to October 7, CensoredMen often posted content promoting conspiracy theories, demonizing transgender people and defending problematic figures such as Andrew Tateâthe misogynistic âmanosphereâ influencer who was indicted on charges of sex trafficking and rape in 2023.

Since October 7, the account has regularly spread false narratives about Israel, including the claim that âIsraelâs greatest allyâ was Jewish financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epsteinâin a post that amassed more than two million views. False narratives calling Epstein a âMossad assetâ are commonly employed by far-right influencers, antisemites and anti-Zionist conspiracy theorists.Â Â 

Â 

CensoredMen alleges that Jeffrey Epstein was âIsraelâs greatest ally.â Source: X

Â 

CensoredMen has also shared demonizing rhetoric and ignorant claims about Jews and Zionism. In March 2024, the account shared a conspiratorial post suggesting that the âJewish-Zionist lobbyâ was spearheading and financing the proposed TikTok banâa topic that prompted a flood of antisemitic narratives among conspiracy theorists and extremists.Â Â 
Â 
In a May 2024 post, which accumulated more than 3.9 million views and 15K likes, the account referred to an eruv in Manhattan as âThe Jewish Wire,â calling it an âinteresting loophole.â Comments on CensoredMenâs post suggest that this tactic proves that observant Jews are elites trying to deceive God. An Eruv is a thin string or wire, often hung near telephone or electric poles, that encompasses Jewish homes enabling religious Jews to carry certain items on the Sabbath.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-statement-attempted-assassination-former-president-trump,"New York, NY, July 14, 2024 ... ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today issued a statement in response to the attempted assassination of former President Donald J. Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO, issued the following statement:

The shooting of former President Trump at a campaign rally is a chilling moment that reminds us of our fragility. Unfortunately, it is almost unsurprising in a public context of escalating tension, intensifying rhetoric, and expanding violence.Â 

None of this is normal. None of it should be normalized.

We are praying for President Trump's health - and for the safety and welfare of all candidates. An attendee was also shot and has been pronounced dead - our thoughts are with their family.Â 

We call both parties to dial down the weaponized partisanship and to support a peaceful election - and to restore decency and decorum to our democracy when this season draws to a close.Â 

We demand that constitutional rights be protected - and that authorities act when those rights are violated by parties who use intimidation and terror to malign and marginalize whole segments of our society.Â 

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact. A global leader in combating antisemitism, countering extremism and battling bigotry wherever and whenever it happens, ADL works to protect democracy and ensure a just and inclusive society for all.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/j7-global-task-force-warns-surge-antisemitism-across-seven-countries-post,"Buenos Aires, Argentina, July 16, 2024 ... Ahead of the 30th anniversary of theÂ AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, the J7 Task Force Against Antisemitism convened to address common challenges, develop coordinated strategies, and share best practices in response to the recent surge in antisemitism worldwide.Â Â 

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of ADL, delivered opening remarks the J7 press conference today:Â âJews are in the crosshairs worldwide. We have experienced this every day since October 7, with Jews and our institutions being threatened and targeted.Â  In another iteration, just this last weekend, immediately following the assassination attempt on former President Trump, online speculation took off with conspiracy theories about Jews, Israel, the Deep State and more. Let me be clear: there is no place in a democracy for political violence, period. There is also no place for senseless, hateful antisemitism. None of this should be normalized.â

The task forceâs recent discussions focused on the alarming rise in antisemitism across all seven countries following Hamasâs October 7 attack on Israel. This occurred against the backdrop of the upcoming anniversary of the AMIA bombing and the ongoing influence of the Islamic Republic of Iran on global terrorism and antisemitism. The J7 Task Force includes leaders from top Jewish advocacy organizations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the U.S.Â 

Leaders of the J7 Task Force communities shared their perspectives on this troubling global surge of anti-Jewish hate in their countries post-October 7:Â 

Argentina -Â Jorge Knoblovits, President, DAIA: âFor DAIA, representing the Argentine Jewish community, it is of utmost importance to welcome the distinguished delegations and committees of the J7 Task Force to the city of Buenos Aires. The global fight against antisemitism, as well as the continuous exchange of knowledge and experiences facilitated by the J7, will undoubtedly contribute significantly to improving the outcomes in the battle against this scourge.âÂ 

Australia â Carly Shamgar, Chief Operating Officer, Executive Council of Australian Jewry: âFollowing the October 7 massacre in Israel, antisemitic incidents in Australia rose 738%.Â  From Jihadi flags and flares on the steps of our iconic Opera House to vandalism of a Jewish Member of Parliament office, concern in the Australian Jewish community remains heightened. We welcome the governmentâs recent announcement of Australiaâs first Antisemitism Envoy, former President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Jillian Segal who has called for a national strategy to combat antisemitism and will report directly to the Prime Minister.âÂ 

Canada â Shimon Fogel, President and CEO, CIJA: âThe battle in which we are engaged is about more than the alarming level of hate directed against the Jewish people and the Jewish state. At its core, it is about the protection of the liberal democratic values that serve as the foundation of western society. Antisemitism is simply the âearly warning systemâ for that global threat. And we ignore it at our collective peril.âÂ 

France â Robert J. Ejnes, Executive Director, CRIF: âAntisemitism has surged alarmingly in France since October 7, 2023. As home to the largest Jewish community in Europe, the country has witnessed a disturbing increase in violent acts targeting Jews of all ages. Moreover, an insidious ""antisemitism of atmosphere"" has permeated French society, making daily life increasingly intolerable for our Jewish fellow-citizens. We must stand in solidarity against this rising tide of hate. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that every citizen, regardless of their background, can live without fear. The situation in France is a stark reminder of the need for vigilance and action to protect the rights and safety of all communities.âÂ 

Germany â Daniel Botmann, CEO, Central Council of Jews in Germany: ""At J7, we are joining forces and knowledge. Together, we want to fight antisemitism and hate in its most abhorrent forms, which we have seen since October 7th. In Germany, we are currently aiming to close the legal loophole regarding the call to eradicate states - a direct line must lead from 'From the river to the sea' to the courtroom.""Â 

UK â Michael Wegier, Chief Executive, Board of Deputies of British Jews: âThe Jewish community is deeply concerned at the massive rise in antisemitism since October 7 which peaked even before Israel responded. We are a strong resilient community which will not allow antisemitism to define our identity as British Jews. We also recognise that non-Jewish allies are essential in helping us combat the waves of Jew hatred in the UK and globally. Our commitment to Israel is resolute as we work to promote its security, peace, societal fairness, and economic prosperity.âÂ 

U.S. - William C. Daroff, CEO, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations: âIn the wake of October 7, the heartbeats of global Jewry became synchronized as one. As we face unthinkable levels of antisemitic harassment and violence, we turn to each other for support and resources. American Jews take seriously our responsibility as the largest diaspora community and stand resolutely by our brethren around the world.""Â 

The J7, theÂ Large Communitiesâ Task Force Against Antisemitism, was formed in response to increasing rates of antisemitism around the world and comprises major Jewish organizations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Argentina and Australia. In addition to top-level consultations, the J7 leads working groups comprised of subject matter experts from each community to develop strategies and action plans within areas such as policy and advocacy, tech policy, security, extremism and education against antisemitism.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/trump-assassination-attempt-sparks-antisemitic-conspiracy-theories-and-violent,"On July 13, 2024, Donald Trump suffered minor injuries when an individual fired multiple shots at the former president shortly after Trump took the stage during a campaign rally in Butler, PA. The attack killed one rally attendee and injuring three, including the former President. The shooter has been identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, PA. While the motivation for the attack remains unknown, federal law enforcement are treating the incident as an assassination attempt.Â Â 

This piece will be updated as new information emerges.Â 

ReactionsÂ 

Online reactions to the assassination attempt elevated a variety of conspiracy theories about the motivation for and ârealâ perpetrators of the attack, as well as calls for retaliatory violence and a civil war.Â 

Jews or Israel are ResponsibleÂ Â 

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Goyim Defense League founder and leader Jon Minadeo hosted a Spaces on X titled âJEWS TRY TO ASSASSINATE TRUMP!â

Â 

Unsurprisingly, users throughout white supremacist spaces blamed Jews for the shooting. One user wrote, âJews have a very long history of political assassination,â and another wrote, âI can't believe it, jews were mad becouse they couldn't beat him with cheats this time lol, Amercia is screwedâ [sic].

Antisemitic conspiracy theorist Stew Peters baselessly asserted that Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, is among the âearly suspectsâ in the attack. Anti-Zionist activist Sulaiman Ahmed wrote on X, âOpinion: Israel shot Trump to install Nikki Haley.â

White supremacist Nick Fuentes posited two possible theories for the shooting, one claiming that Israeli intelligence carried out the operation to replace Trump with a candidate who would âsupport Gaza/West Bank Annexation and expansion of the war into Lebanon and Iran.â In a Spaces session on X, Fuentes further expressed his suspicions that Israel was responsible for the shooting because they want a âmore favorable advocate in the White House.âÂ 

On July 16, CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad tweeted a link to a CNN story about the Secret Service being on high alert in the weeks before the attempted assassination due to a potential threat on Trump's life from Iran. Awad commented on the story, which does not mention Israel: ""Are you sure this is not an Israeli plot to ignite another war between the US and other countries in the Middle East at its behest?""

Â 



The Left or the âDeep Stateâ is Responsible

Many social media accounts blame âthe leftâ for the shooting. Antisemitic conspiracy theorist Rick Wiles cast aspersions on President Biden, writing in a post on X: âSCOTUS gave total immunity to U.S. Presidents for official acts. The Court heard legal arguments that it included assassination of opponents. We have entered into a dangerous era.âÂ 

Meanwhile, conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec responded to the news by writing on X, âThese leftists wonât stop until Trump is dead.â Laura Loomer, another conspiracy theorist, echoed this claim, writing that the Democrats and President Biden âhave been planning to assassinate President Trump for a long time now.â One media personality wrote on X: âThe Dems realized itâs too late to switch out their candidate so they attempted to kill ours instead.â

The official NWNC Proud Boys channel shared a meme with Presidents Lincoln, Reagan and Trump with the message, âYou know you are a good Republican president when the left attempts to murder you.â

Â 

Some people across various social media platforms have alleged that the shooting was orchestrated by the Deep State, an alleged clandestine network of federal agencies and elites who are pursuing its own agenda within the U.S. government.Â 

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones warned that the Deep State will try again to kill Trump and claimed that âwe are in the middle of a Deep State hot coup.â Journalist Patrick Howley wrote, âThe Deep State tried to kill my boy,â and another user wrote, âThe deep state globalist war pigs are probably working with the dems on this.â

The shooting was a false flag, staged or an inside job

In another post, Wiles wrote on X, âEyewitness repeatedly pointed for 3 minutes at assassin on roof with rifle. Law enforcement ignored him. Whatâs up with this? Inside job?â One Telegram user wrote, âAnother potential false flag. 8 shots and no one else hit? Common.âÂ  An X account echoed these sentiments in a post that has been viewed over 1.9 million times. The post includes a photo of a counter-sniper and baselessly claims that the sniper had the would-be assassin in his sights but waited to engage. Injecting antisemitism into the post, they then wrote, âWhatâs with the red Kabbalah string on his hand?âÂ 

Meanwhile, others doubted the legitimacy of the assassination attempt. On X, some users have alleged that the shooting was staged to boost Trumpâs Presidential campaign, and on patriots.win, a forum used by extreme Trump supporters, one user wrote, âJust because the country didn't civil war today, doesn't mean it won't tomorrow. Look out for false flags blamed on angry trump supporters.â

Blaming Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) InitiativesÂ 

Extremists and conspiracy theorists were quick to blame âDEI hiresâ for the attack, often referencing the female Secret Service agents who surrounded Trump and ushered him offstage. In one Proud Boys Telegram channel, a user suggested that the female agents must have been incompetent because âthe standards arenât the sameââ promoting the misogynistic stereotype that women are less qualified and, therefore, were only hired to fill a âdiversity quota.â

Â 

On X, self-proclaimed investigative journalist James OâKeefe also suggested that the female agents on the scene were incapable, writing that ""they canât even holster a gun properly.â Fuentes responded with, âLOL no more female cops please.â

Christopher Pohlhaus, leader of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, reshared a post on Telegram targeting U.S. Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, claiming that she has overprioritized âdiversity-hiring.â

Calls for Violence or a Civil War

Many users on platforms like X, patriots.win and Telegram responded with calls for violence and a civil war. Such calls are dangerous because they normalize the use of violence against perceived political enemies. On X, one user wrote, âFuck every single one of you fucking worthless Democratsâ¦Now, we are going to fucking destroy you.â One Telegram user wrote, âBring it onâ¦now we mobilize.â On patriots.win, one user wrote, âSo letâs shoot them back. Play time is over,â and another wrote, âThe only way this will be solved is through violence.â Another user wrote, âthey will have blood all over themselves when we go after them. Their blood,â and then added in a different thread, âYou missed, but we won't. Retaliation is coming. Someone hired the assassin, a professionalâ¦We will hunt down that someone.â

Others framed the assassination attempt as the beginning of a civil war. One X user wrote, âThe lunatic liberal left. The war has begun,â and another wrote, âThis is Civil War, and we havenât heard the âShot Heard around the World,â Until NOW!!!â [sic]. Meanwhile on patriots.win, a user wrote, âLooks like the Civil War just started, you dems are fucked.âÂ 

The perpetratorÂ 

ADL Center on Extremism (COE) researchers have found FEC data showing that a then-17-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks donated $15 to ActBlue on January 21, 2021 (the day of President Bidenâs inauguration) when he was 17 years old, earmarking it to the Democratic PACâs Progressive Turnout Project. However, according to Pennsylvania voter records, Crooks registered as a Republican when he turned 18 in September 2021.â¯Â 

On Sunday, July 14, the New York Times reported that authorities found what appear to be two explosive devices in Crooksâ car and another at his home.Â 

COE researchers did identify Discord and YouTube accounts that appear to belong to Crooks, but the accounts do not shed light on a potential motive.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-report-iranian-regimes-hispantv-promotes-antisemitism-hispanic,"30 Years After AMIA Bombing, the Iranian Regime'sÂ HispanTV Promotes Antisemitism to Hispanic AudiencesÂ 

New York, NY, July 15,Â 2024 ...Â HispanTV, a Spanish-language media outlet founded by the Islamic Republic of Iranâs state-controlled media corporation and with extensive reach in Latin America, promotes the Iranian regimeâs antisemitic views, Holocaust revisionism, anti-Israel prejudice, and incitement, a new ADL report has found.Â Â 

On the 30th anniversary of the bombing of the AMIA Jewish Federation in Buenos Aires, Argentinaâthe Iranian regime-backed attack where 85 lives were lost and over 300 people were injuredâan ADL report highlightsÂ HispanTV's propagation of antisemitism and anti-Israel bias in Latin America and beyond. The network's extensive global reach spans nearly 600 million Spanish speakers through satellite, cable, livestreaming, and social media platforms.Â 

Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO, currently in Argentina with ADL leaders, said:Â ""On the 30th anniversary of Argentina's deadliest terrorist attack, the AMIA bombing perpetrated by the Iranian regime and its proxy Hezbollah, it's evident that the Iranian regime continues to perpetuate antisemitism through multiple channels. Alongside physical violence, the Islamic Republic of Iran, as the worldâs leading state-sponsor of antisemitism and terrorism, uses cultural centers and media across Latin America to incite hostility against Jewish communities. The cynical use of media outlets likeÂ HispanTV to amplify antisemitic conspiracies and disinformation is reprehensible and unethical. In our report, we outline concrete steps to urge policymakers and corporations to take swift action to preventÂ HispanTV and other Iranian regime media from spreading hate through these platforms.âÂ 

Among other channels, the Islamic Republic ofÂ lran spreads its incitement through the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), which the United States sanctioned in 2013 and 2022 for human rights violations. The Iranian regime primarily utilizes IRIB'sÂ PressTV (established 2007) and its Spanish-language counterpart,Â HispanTV (established 2011), to promote global antisemitism.Â 

The report examines concrete examples of howÂ HispanTV propagates antisemitism, revealing howÂ HispanTV spreads conspiracies, falsehoods, myths, and disinformation across several key categories:Â 

Antisemitic Tropes about Jews and Jewish PowerÂ to perpetuate the myth that Zionists,Â HispanTVâs euphemism for Jews in general, control Hollywood and were also behind the COVID-19 pandemic.Â 
Post October-7 Disinformation and denialism, twisting the facts of the bloodiest antisemitic attack on Jews since the Holocaust to fabricate an alternative narrative blaming Israel.
Denialism and Conspiracies related to Latin America, such as the denial of the Iranian regimeâs role in the AMIA terrorist attack and the promotion of the obscureÂ Plan Andinia conspiracy.
Glorifying TerrorismÂ by presenting the indiscriminate violence Tehranâs proxies commit against civilians as a legitimate formÂ on armed resistance.
Justifying the Eradication of IsraelÂ as an illegitimate entity that should not exist in the Middle East.
Glorifying the Islamic Republic of Iran and its ProxiesÂ to counter the ""Zionist entity"" through its revolutionary forces and proxies.
Historical RevisionismÂ by distorting events related to the Holocaust and making false comparisons with Zionism and Israel.
Propagating Anti-Israel Prejudice, falsely claiming that Israel is an Apartheid State and is committing ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-launches-first-ever-words-action-antisemitism-training-latin-america,"Buenos Aires, Argentina, July 14,Â 2024 ... Today, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) announced its inaugural Words to Action facilitator training seminar in Latin America, set to begin just days before the 30th anniversary of the AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires.Â 

In response to a sharp global rise of antisemitism and antisemitic incidents since October 7th, Words to Action has become a highly sought-after educational program providing tools for Jewish youth to understand and effectively address antisemitism, anti-Israel bias, stereotypes, prejudice, and hate speech.Â 

In collaboration with the Jewish Museum of Chile and hosted at the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires, this unique seminar focuses on training experienced local Jewish educators who will then empower Jewish youth, families, and communities in Latin America to confront these growing challenges effectively.Â Â 

âBringing ADLâs antisemitism education tools to Latin American communities for the first time will empower Jewish young adults and members of the community with the knowledge and confidence to address everyday antisemitism, which has drastically increased since Hamasâs October 7 attack on Israel. We are excited to expand our program to the region together with our partners and the help of our dedicated facilitators who will be conducting this crucial work. We believe that the curriculum will help participants develop the tools to confront antisemitism in all its forms and build confidence to challenge antisemitic myths,â said Marina Rosenberg, ADLâs SVP for International Affairs.Â 

Following the facilitator training seminar, the Words to Action program will be available for communities in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, with plans for future expansion throughout Latin America.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/anti-defamation-leagues-task-force-middle-east-minorities-expresses-grave,"NEW YORK â Theâ¯Anti-Defamation Leagueâs [ADL] Task Force on Middle East Minorities expressed grave concern over the recent escalation of violence targeting Syrian refugees in TÃ¼rkiye, and calls on Turkish authorities to ensure the safety of Syrian and Arab refugees and bring the perpetrators to justice.Â Â 

Â 

On June 30, 2024, an angry mob vandalized and burned vehicles owned by Syrians in the Turkish province of Kayseri, following a social media post alleging that a Syrian man molested a child. The violence soon spread to five other provinces, namely Bursa, Gaziantep, Hatay, Istanbul, and Konya, and is escalating at an alarming level, with vigilante groups marching in Syrian neighborhoods, vandalizing property, and attacking Syrian and Arab individuals.Â 

Â 

Shadi Martini, co-chair of ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities and Chief Executive Director of Multifaith Alliance, said:Â 

Â 

âWe are horrified by the images coming from various Turkish provinces, including the burning and looting of the properties of Syrian refugees, reports of beatings, and the disturbing news that 17-year-old Ahmet Handan El Naif was stabbed to death. No one should be afraid to walk the streets or live in fear that their homes could be destroyed and property burned because of their ethnicity or national origin. We urge Turkish authorities to take swift action to protect all vulnerable individuals and communities from any form of violence and hate crimes. We also applaud all Turkish individuals and civil society organizations standing in solidarity with Syrian and Arab victims of this wave of violence.âÂ 

Â 

ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities coordinator Tugba Tanyeri-Erdemir noted:Â 

Â 

âThe scapegoating of displaced Syrians by xenophobic hatemongers has incited violence targeting TÃ¼rkiyeâs Arab residents in numerous cities around the country. The violent attacks add to the suffering this vulnerable community has already experienced at the hands of the Assad regime during the Syrian Civil War. It is crucial for Turkish authorities to apprehend and prosecute all the perpetrators to the full extent of the law, and prevent a culture of impunity for anti-refugee hate crimes.â",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/time-escalate-anti-israel-activists-intensify-protests-violent-direct-actions,"Across the country in recent months, many anti-Israel activists have been engaged in strategic âescalationâ to further their cause. These actions have included increasingly aggressive and targeted protests, property destruction and defacement, physical takeovers of institutions deemed to be âcomplicitâ in alleged Israeli military actions, and even multiple cases of ideologically motivated arson attacks.Â 

For the most part, the tactics themselves â such as vandalism or protests at individualsâ homes â are not new. Private corporations including weapons manufacturers as well as other organizations with alleged ties to Israel have been targeted by vandals intent on disrupting operations for years before October 7. Since the Hamas-led attack on Israel, U.S. government buildings and lawmakersâ offices have been vandalized and prominent elected representatives, governors, and presidential cabinet members have also faced protests outside their homes.

However, the scope and scale of these tactics have shifted and expanded in recent months. Particularly notable has been the trend on college campuses, where some anti-Israel student activists escalated from tent encampments on lawns and other spaces to violently seizing and blockading buildings.

One action that gained widespread attention and sparked similar escalations at other schools was the takeover of a building at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt from April 22â30. The student protesters barricaded themselves inside Siemens Hall and caused significant damage, including breaking into the university presidentâs office and spray-painting messages on the walls.

Â 

In another high-profile incident, on April 30, protesters at Columbia University in New York escalated their weeks-long encampment by breaking into the universityâs Hamilton Hall. They broke windows and barricaded themselves inside using zip-ties and furniture, causing significant property damage and locking a facilities worker inside during the takeover.

Escalating actions continued throughout May and June, including anti-Israel motivated arson attacks in multiple states, the takeover of the Brooklyn Museum, and targeted harassment of Jewish individuals at their homes.

The language used by anti-Israel protesters to promote and endorse these actions has also become more unapologetically extreme. Though many of these actions have been organized by autonomous groups, they are not spontaneous. They reflect increasingly extreme calls by leading anti-Zionist voices urging escalation.Â 

Escalating Rhetoric

Recent actions reflect the evolving strategy articulated by anti-Zionists in their publications, speeches and social media posts.

Zines, CommuniquÃ©s and How-To Guides

âZinesâ (short for âfanzineâ or âmagazineâ) are short publications created by individuals or groups that are intended to be circulated online or in print among those who share a particular interest. Activists â including those in the anti-Israel movement â regularly use zines to express their views, respond to trends, outline strategies and highlight actions.

Anti-Israel student protest organizers at schools like California Polytechnic State University, Humboldt; Columbia University; Emory University; University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and elsewhere published zines or communiquÃ©s promoting their direct actions against their universities in April and May. The Columbia students wrote, âOur struggle has only just begunâ¦We chose action, and you must tooâagain, again, until the weight of our collective action and refusal dismantles the prisons and all our prisoners flood the streets. UNTIL VICTORY!â

The New York University Palestine Solidarity Coalition published a âmanifestoâ on May 7 that laid out six unifying principles for the âStudent Intifada,â with the first principle stating that ânow more than ever we must escalate.â The statement further declared: âWe will continue to intensify our actions until our demands are met, until the genocide ends, until the zionist [sic] entity crumbles, and until Palestine is free.â

The radical New York-based anti-Zionist group Within Our Lifetime (WOL) published a zine on April 27 titled âTo Them, We Are All Outside Agitators: Encampments & Escalation.â The zine encouraged anti-Israel protesters âto prioritize escalation trainingsâ¦to learn how to build effective barricades, how to link arms most effectively to resist police attacks, or what type of expanding foam works best on the kind of doorknobs present in our universities.â WOL emphasized that âthis is not rhetoric â this is an urgent needâ and declared, âno more negotiating the terms of our existence and resistance. There is only an enemy to fight and a struggle that seeks victory.â

Â 

On April 28, an autonomous collective referring to itself as the Fire Ant Movement Defense published a zine titled âWe Donât Need âSafetyâ â We Need To Escalate!â It was circulated by the âEscalate Network,â a collective formed in response to the student encampment efforts in mid-April seeking to help the anti-Israel movement âbreak out of the confines of universities, to spread throughout society.â It was also published on the website Itâs Going Down, a self-described âdigital community center for anarchist, anti-fascist, autonomous anti-capitalist and anti-colonial movements.â

The zine instructed: âThe Palestinian Resistance â the people who are on the ground fighting and dying â are calling for American students to escalate. It is our duty to heed their call!â¦To achieve victory we must escalate the struggle and combat all forces â external and internal â which prevent us from doing so.â

On May 1, Palestine Action U.S. â the U.S.-based faction of a global anti-Zionist collective whose stated mission is âdisrupting and dismantling zionism [sic] and US imperialismâ and which supports âmilitant direct actionsâ â created and distributed a guide titled âFLOOD THE GATES: ESCALATE.â The zine called for groups and individuals to âescalate from mass rallies to mass blockades of weapons companies; from encampments to building occupations; from getting kettled by the police to kettling them backâ¦â Â 

The guide was shared widely by popular accounts like Resistance News Network (RNN), a radical antisemitic Telegram channel that regularly promotes U.S.-recognized terror groups like Hamas. Student groups also took notice. The Columbia University Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) chapter commented on the original Palestine Action U.S. post, writing âIT IS TIME TO ESCALATE,â while the Georgia State University Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter shared the pamphlet on their Instagram story.

Zines with specific instructions about how to establish encampments, confront institutions, and physically resist police also circulated, offering step-by-step guides for engaging in disruptive actions that encompassed potentially violent or illegal activities.

For example, the âDe-Arrest Primerâ published in April 2024 by the âhaters cafe,â a blog run by a collective of self-described anarchists, circulated among anti-Zionist activists and was distributed in person at campus encampments. The zine acknowledged that some of the actions it outlined âcould be considered a crime,â but nonetheless encouraged such steps be taken to âfreeâ arrested protesters.

The Escalate Network also circulated an updated version of âThe Do-It-Yourself Occupation Guide,â originally published in the early 2010s during the Occupy movement and revised in April 2024 in response to the anti-Israel student encampments. The guide instructed organizers on tactics such as breaking entering into locked buildings using bolt cutters, crowbars or other tools, âbarricading doorsâ and more.

Extreme Rhetoric Online and On-The-Ground

The escalation language promoted in publications was reiterated in various on-the-ground and online spaces.

On May 24â26, hundreds of anti-Israel activists gathered in Detroit, MI for the âPeopleâs Conference for Palestine,â where many of the anti-Zionist movementâs most influential forces gathered to assess their progress to date and strategize their path forward. As noted in ADL expertsâ assessment of the conference, a common refrain among the eventâs speakers was support for terror and a call for direct actions against Zionism â not just in Israel and Palestine, but around the world.

Similar rhetoric promulgated online, particularly in response to Israelâs military offensive against Hamas in the Gazan city of Rafah in late May. The Wisconsin-based Madison for Palestine, a radical anti-Israel group that has long engaged in âanti-normalizationâ efforts, shared a post on May 27 that stated: âWe are beyond calling for a ceasefireâ¦Resistance is the only way. The Zionist colonial entity must be fought and dismantled at all costs. ABHOLISH [sic] ISRAEL.â

A May 29 social media post shared by multiple Pennsylvania-based anti-Zionist groups declaring âIF WE BURN, YOU BURN WITH USâ and âNow is the time to escalate.â (source: Instagram)

Â 

A group of Pennsylvania-based anti-Israel groups including Lancaster Palestine Coalition, Pittsburgh Palestine Coalition, and Harrisburg Palestine Coalition shared a social media post referencing Rafah on May 29 with the message âIF WE BURN, YOU BURN WITH USâ and a caption that read, in part, ânow is the time to escalateâ¦â

Social media influencer account @key48return, which frequently posts false or misleading anti-Israel infographics on Instagram, posted a graphic on May 29 that garnered more than 280K likes. It proclaimed: âDoing the same thing for 8 months and expecting different results is insanity. Stop the one hour protests at the weekend, and make your life a protestâ¦Everything must change & we must be the ones to change it.â

Escalating Actions

In numerous cases, the calls to âescalateâ have been answered on the ground. The ADL Center on Extremism examined a sampling of these recent incidents.

Arson

On May 2, anti-Israel activists referring to themselves as Rachel Corrieâs Ghost Brigade (named after the American activist who was accidentally killed in Gaza in 2003 while protesting against Israel) broke into the Portland Police Bureau training facility in Oregon and set multiple fires, causing more than a dozen police cars to burn.

In a statement claiming responsibility published on the anarchist website Rose City Counter-Info, the group wrote: âWe call for more actions to avenge Palestinians and the brutalized students at PSU [Portland State University] and beyond! Let ten million cop cars burn!â The statement also addressed anti-Israel student protesters, telling them: âFIGHT! Defend your camps! If the frat bros come, smash their frat house windows! If the Zionist settlers come, throw fireworks at them! If the cops come donât just resist arrest, fight them! They will hate you and beat you if youâre peaceful or violent, and it is time to be violent.â

Â 

In June, Palestine Action U.S. posted about a series of arson incidents at the University of California, Berkeley. On June 1, a UC Berkeley police car was set on fire while parked on campus. Palestine Action U.S. wrote on social media that the action was done âin solidarity with the resistance axis for Palestinian life, liberation, and total decolonization of the zionist [sic] occupied lands.â

The group declared: âBlessed is the flame that burns down the settler-plantation. Blessed are the rockets that will free thousands of prisoners held captive by the zionist settler entity and US colonizer police stateâ¦Knife to the throat of zionism. Death to amerikkka. Glory to the martyrs.â

On June 13, Palestine Action U.S. commented on a âfirebombâ at the university, writing that âEVERY SINGLE BUILDING ON THE UC BERKELEY CAMPUS DESERVES TO BE INCINERATEDâ and that âUC SYSTEM MUST DIVEST FROM ISRAEL OR FACE OUR WRATH OF REVENGE.â A few days later, on June 16, Palestine Action U.S. posted about another arson incident at a construction site at UC Berkeley. They wrote: âphase two of the #Escalate movement heats up.â

On June 17, Casey Robert Goonan, a 34-year-old Oakland resident was arrested for his alleged connection to the series of UC Berkeley arsons.

Meanwhile, in Oakland, CA on June 11, protesters attempted to break the windows of the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building with rocks and throw a firebomb inside. However, their plans were partially thwarted when the windows apparently didnât fully shatter and a security guard appeared, so they instead lit the firebomb outside. Palestine Action U.S. and Indybay, the San Francisco Bay Area branch of the Independent Media Center, released a statement that the action was done âin unity with the global axis of resistanceâ and in âretaliationâ for the alleged crackdown on anti-Israel student encampment protesters.

Occupying Buildings and Vandalizing Property

Since the high-profile building takeovers at Cal Poly Humboldt and Columbia, students at many other schools have followed suit with destructive actions.

On May 14, the Oakland, CA office of University of California president Michael V. Drake was vandalized by an anonymous group of anti-Israel activists who claimed that their actions were done ââ¦in solidarity with the Palestinian Resistance.â They detailed their actions: âUsing a fire extinguisher filled with red paint we covered the facade and smashed seven windows. Then, with access to the building, we released 500 cockroaches inside and emptied a second fire extinguisher onto the interior.â

At the University of California, Berkeley, students occupied Anna Head Alumnae Hall from May 15â16, using âsticks, pry bars and bolt cuttersâ and breaking windows to enter the condemned property. They also spray painted antisemitic and violent messages on the walls, including equating a Star of David with a swastika alongside phrases like âZIONISM = NAZISM,â âMARTYRS NEVER DIE,â âA GOOD SOLDIER IS A DEAD ONE,â âKILL COPSâ and âESCALATE IN THIS BITCH.â 12 protesters were arrested after police cleared the building.

Â 

On June 5, the last day of classes of the spring semester at Stanford University in California, a group of anti-Israel student protesters barricaded themselves inside the presidentâs office. They caused âextensive damageâ according to a campus spokesperson, including spray-painting messages like âdeath 2 Israhellâ on the walls.

A group of anti-Israel protesters had previously tried to occupy a different building on Stanfordâs campus on May 20, but that group was quickly broken up by campus police. The June takeover was more coordinated, with students inside and outside the building working together to prevent law enforcement from entering for many hours and barricading doors âwith bike locks, chains, ladders and chairs and [covering] security cameras with tin foil,â according to a report in The Stanford Daily. Thirteen students were arrested for their alleged participation.

On June 12, a few dozen students barricaded themselves inside a California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) student services building. They displayed a banner renaming the building âLeila Khaled Hallâ â named in honor of the notorious Popular Front for the Liberation (PFLP)-affiliated terrorist who is infamous for hijacking two civilian airliners in 1969 and 1970 â and vandalized and stole property. University staff who were inside at the time were forced to shelter in place for two hours before security officers were able to establish âa safe exit.â

Â 

These tactics have not been limited to college campuses. On May 31, Within Our Lifetime led a large crowd of protesters in an attempt to occupy the Brooklyn Museum in New York. Dozens of individuals overwhelmed security to force their way into the museum, while hundreds more gathered outside cheering them on. Protesters used spray paint and markers to write messages like âZionism is terrorismâ and âZionism: your day is comingâ on museum windows and art installations. 34 people were arrested in connection with the protest.

Targeting Individuals

Anti-Israel protesters have regularly targeted the homes of high-profile individuals like governors and U.S. representatives, university presidents, and others since October 7. Escalating actions have expanded the targets of these types of protests.

University of Michigan regent Jordan Acker, who is Jewish, has been targeted on multiple occasions. On May 15, around 4:40 AM, an individual covering their face with a keffiyeh walked up to Ackerâs house while his family was asleep inside and attached a list of demands on the front door attributed to the âUMich Gaza Solidarity Encampment.â On June 3, multiple masked individuals vandalized Ackerâs law offices by splashing red paint on the front of the building and spray-painting anti-Israel slogans around the property.

From late May through June, anti-Israel activists affiliated with anti-Zionist group Code Pink and others have repeatedly confronted individuals and their families at their homes in Washington, D.C. This includes harassing U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller as well as CNN journalist and anchor Jake Tapper, who is Jewish. The protesters also targeted members of their families, including shouting âshame on youâ at Millerâs wife and telling Tapperâs children âyour dad is lying and killing.â

In New York on June 12, the houses of Anne Pasternak, the Jewish director of the Brooklyn Museum, and multiple members of the museumâs board were vandalized with red paint and inverted red triangles â symbols that are often used to indicate a Hamas target. The anonymous group that vandalized the directorâs house stated it was inspired by a call from Within Our Lifetime âfor sustained action against cultural institutions that materially and rhetorically support genocide.â

Â 

Anti-Israel protesters affiliated with Shut Down Elbit South Florida, Code Pink South Florida, and other local groups protested outside the home of two mid-level employees of Real-Time Laboratories in Boca Raton, FL on June 16. The protest was an escalation from the demonstratorsâ routine actions outside the Real-Time Laboratories offices.

Jewish and Israeli business owners and patrons have also been targeted. In Houston, TX, multiple businesses owned by Jewish restaurateur Ben Berg were vandalized in mid-May with red paint and antisemitic fliers.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/anti-jewish-and-anti-israel-attitudes-increased-after-october-7-four-uc,"New York, NY, July 11, 2024 â¦ Belief in classic antisemitic tropes increased on four University of California (UC) campuses after Oct. 7, 2023, as did negative sentiments toward Israel, according to a survey of students sponsored by the ADLÂ (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Antisemitism Research (CAR).

Among students surveyed at the four UC campuses (UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC Riverside, UC Merced), anti-Israel attitudes are much stronger than the general public.Â Belief in anti-Jewish tropes, however, isÂ similar to the rest of society. Both have increased with time spent at University after Hamasâ Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

Among the key findings of the UC survey:

Before Oct. 7, 15 percent of respondents believed it was appropriate for opponents of Israelâs policies to boycott Jewish -owned businesses in their communities; after Oct. 7, this number increased to 19 percent.
The antisemitic belief that, âJews donât care about what happens to anyone but other Jewsâ increased from 10 to 19 percent.
The notion that âJews are more loyal to Israel than to the United Statesâ increased from 25 to 35 percent.
Student belief in the antisemitic trope that, âJews have too much power in our countryâ increased from 8 to 13 percent.Â 

Anti-Israel sentiment also increased after Oct. 7, 2023. Notably, while before Oct. 7, 51 percent of respondents believed Israelis carried more responsibility than Palestinians for the past three years of violence, that number increased to 58 percent after the attacks. Before Oct. 7, 38 percent of respondents felt admiration or respect toward Israel, 27 percent felt the same after. And, while 78 percent of respondents agreed before Oct. 7 that âthere are no justifications for Palestinian suicide bombers targeting Israeli civilians,â this number dropped to 74 percent after the attacks.

Anti-Israel sentiments of students remain the most powerful predictors of believing traditional antisemitic views.Â Other predictors include xenophobia, political ideology, home religion and belief in conspiracies.Â 

âThis study illustrates the undeniable relationship between hatred of the Jewish people and hatred of the Jewish state,âÂ said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âJewish students, faculty, and administrators have felt increasingly isolated and threatened on campus since the Oct. 7 massacre. University leaders must protect Jews from the violence and harassment they experienced from people who act on these hateful beliefs.â

This change in attitude is happening in a broader context of dramatically increasing antisemitism across the country, especially in California, where ADL documented a record number of antisemitic incidents the 2023Â Audit of Antisemitic Incidents. ADL recorded 1,266 antisemitic incidents in California, up 144 percent from 518 incidents recorded in 2022.

âIn defiance of our expectations, antisemitic attitudes among students increased after Oct. 7 and may account for the sense of isolation and hostility that many Jewish students and faculty reported on various University of California campuses in the weeks and months after the onset of the Israel-Hamas war,â said Dr. Jeffrey Kopstein, professor of Political Science at University of California, Irvine, and CAR research partner.Â âThe data indicates that campuses mirror and magnify the problem of antisemitism in the United States today.â
Â 
To assess the relationship between anti-Jewish attitudes and anti-Israel sentiments among students, Dr. Kopstein and his team developed an original questionnaire that was sent out to a random sample of undergraduates at four University of California campuses. They collected a sample of undergraduate student emails from each universityâs Registrarâs Office, spanning across all cohorts and majors: 5,000 from UC Irvine (UCI), 5,000 from UC Los Angeles (UCLA), 4,000 from UC Riverside (UCR), and 2,000 from UC Merced (UCM). The survey was administered through Qualtrics and invitations to participate were carried out in waves, depending on when we received the random samples from each university. A significant part of this survey was fielded before Oct. 7, 2023 at UC Irvine, which allowed the researchers to assess the effect of the massacre in Israel on attitudes toward Israel and Jews.

Voting in elections is central to our democracy. Casting a vote allows people to express their point of view about issues (e.g. the economy, healthcare, voting rights, reproductive rights, immigration) that are important to them. Voting enables voters to weigh in on the candidate they believe will best represent their positions and make the changes that are important to them.Â Â 

Â 

In political elections, people vote for a variety of offices and laws. This includes local elections (e.g., Mayor, City Council person, Judge), state elections (e.g., State Senator, Governor) and national elections (e.g., U.S. House of Representatives, Senator, President).Â Â Â 

Â 

If youâve ever voted in any election, you would have likely seen and interacted with âpoll workers.â Election or poll workers help manage the voting process and help voters at local polling sites on election day. They are a key part of the election process and help ensure that elections are accessible, accurate and fair. Poll workers make elections possible and are essential to our democratic process.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-crowell-bring-suit-hold-iran-syria-and-north-korea-accountable,"New York, NY, July 1, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and Crowell & Moring LLP today filed a federal lawsuit alleging Iran, Syria and North Korea provided material support to Hamas that enabled it to commit atrocities in Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed, injured, and terrorized scores of U.S. citizens and their families, and seeking financial compensation under applicable federal and local laws. The suit names over 125 plaintiffs, including U.S. citizens who were injured or killed as a result of the October 7 attack, and immediate family members of those injured or killed.

âIran is the worldâs leading state sponsor of antisemitism and terror â along with Syria and North Korea, they must be held responsible for their roles in the largest antisemitic attack since the Holocaust. We are doing everything possible to hold Hamas terrorists and those who support them accountable, including putting all of ADLâs weight behind this effort,â saidÂ Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âIn a world in which Jewish pain and suffering is far too often erased, we hope this ground-breaking case will bring justice to some victims and create a record of Hamasâ heinous brutality perpetrated with the support of these state sponsors of terrorism.â

This case seeks to hold the state sponsors of this heinous attack liable under the Terrorism Exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Foreign countries that sponsor terrorist activities typically refuse to honor judgments against them. The victims will then need the support of the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund â a fund Congress created in 2015 to allow American victims of terrorism, such as those in this case to obtain some meaningful relief for their suffering. Since its founding, more than 18,000 American victims of state-sponsored terrorism have been deemed eligible by the Fund. Unfortunately, recently, the Fund has not been providing meaningful compensation to victims as Congress intended, requiring legislative action to ensure consistent and meaningful payments to the victims. Recently, Representatives Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., introduced bipartisan legislation in May to address this deficiency and help the victims. ADL and Crowell are simultaneously working on these legislative efforts with congressional leaders in tandem with the litigation to ensure that the American victims of the October 7th terrorist attacks will receive the compensation to which they are entitled when they obtain their judgments.

âThere is more than ample precedent for this case: U.S. courts have repeatedly held Iran, Syria and North Korea responsible for material support of terrorist attacks that harmed U.S. and dual U.S.-Israeli citizens,â said James Pasch, ADL Senior Director of National Litigation and ADLâs lead counsel on this case. âThere is also clear evidence that these state sponsors of terrorism provided material support to Hamas terrorists that enabled the terrorists to commit the atrocities on October 7. In a world in which October 7th denialism took hold almost immediately after the attack, this case will set the record straight about the horrors of what occurred on that day, who was responsible for providing material support for this heinous terrorist attack, and will ultimately provide a path for justice, accountability and redress.â

Each of the more than 100 plaintiffs in this suit is a U.S. citizen, or the family member of a U.S. citizen, and is therefore eligible to bring suit for the deaths and physical and emotional injuries Hamas caused during its barbaric rampage. The case details the horrors the victims experienced at the hands of Hamas terrorists at numerous locations, including the Nova Music Festival, Kibbutz Be'eri, Kibbutz Sa'ad, Kibbutz Kissufim, Sufa Base, Kibbutz Erez, Kibbutz Alumim, Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Ofakim, among others.

California native Adrienne Neta was murdered in the attack at Kibbutz Beâeri.

âMy mom, Adrienne Neta, was born and raised in California. Her father was an Air Force engineer, and the family lived on Navy bases for most of her childhood. In the early 80s, she made aliya and married my dad, and together,Â they built a family in KibbutzÂ Beâeri,â saidÂ plaintiff Nahar Neta.Â âWhile nothing will ever undo the unbearable pain Hamas caused our family or the brutal losses weâve suffered, we hope this case will bring some sense of justice. Itâs important for us to be able to tell our stories so the world can hear how Hamas has terrorized Israel, the Jewish people, and many American citizens.Â My mom devoted her life to caring for othersÂ regardless of race or religiousÂ beliefs. She was a peace and justice seeker who was active in many civilian efforts to bridge the gap between Jews and Arabs in Israel.â

The complaint allegesÂ how the defendants provided material supportÂ to Hamas that enabled the terrorist group to commit its atrocities â including military, tactical, and financial support.

ADL is serving as co-counsel along with Crowell & Moring, a firm with decades of experience in litigating and winning terrorism cases, including cases arising from the bombing of UTA flight 772 in 1989, the bombings of the U.S. embassy in Beirut in 1983 and 1984, and the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998, among numerous other attacks. To date, Crowell & Moring has successfully obtained billions of dollars in judgments for claims arising from international terrorism. Crowell & Moringâs Terrorism Litigation Team is led byÂ Aryeh Portnoy andÂ John Murino.

âIt is imperative to combat terrorism using whatever tools are available,â Portnoy said. âOne of those tools is the courts, and another is the U.S. Victims of State-Sponsored Terrorism Fund. We are committed to fighting for the victims and families so that they are never forgotten, and so that they may find some measure of justice for the horrors they have endured.â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/anti-israel-summer-schools-emerge-nationwide,"While the anti-Israel encampments have largely been dismantled, their architects appear determined to capitalize on what they see as their most successful organizing tactic in a decade. âSummer schoolâ is now in session, led locally and nationally by pro-Palestinian individuals and groups.Â 

These âschoolsâ â currently scheduled to run from June through August â are designed to educate and train student and community activists. Some are only open to current students. As of June 25, National Students for Justice in Palestine, SUNY BDS, UMass Amherst + Smith SJPs and San Francisco State University associate professor Rabab Abdulhadi have each provided links to register for their own programs.Â 

Curricula vary from school to school, but the teaching generally focuses on Palestinian history, political action and practical skills training.Â 

Support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement is ubiquitous among the groups organizing these sessions, which are led by seasoned anti-Israel activists, but is often seen as âthe floor, not the ceiling.â Students may learn âlessonsâ from encampments and other âdirect actionsâ alongside political theory and basic organizing skills. Participants will also likely emerge with stronger social networks, which have been critical to successful encampments.Â 

Â 

Participants must commit significant time and energy to these programs, as evidenced by the calendar information below.Â Â 

2024 Schools

UMass Amherst and Smith SJPâs âPolitical Education Summer Campâ (June 1- Aug. 31) is an encampment spin-off, focused on community building, political theory and Palestinian history. Open to all.Â 

National SJPâs âsummer schoolâ (tentatively July 1- Aug. 9) consists of 15 two-hour online sessions, with course themes such as âOur History & Path to Freedom,â âRaising Consciousness, Building Revolutionariesâ and âHow We Win.âÂ  Applications opened June 20 and are limited to undergrad and grad students who are SJP leaders, SJP members those leaders vouch for or leaders of partners organizations like MSA and JVP.

SUNY BDSâs virtual âSummer Academyâ (July 1 - 28) is focused on organizing, digital security and media/PRi Registration and courses were released on June 20. Open to all.Â 

Rahab Abduhadiâs summer school class at SFSU (June 6-July 5) will use the Teaching Palestine: Pedagogical Praxis and the Indivisibility of Justice platform, focusing on âPalestinian diasporic experiencesâ and the âPalestinian resistance movement.â Teaching Palestine is another project of Abdulhadiâs. She describes it as âan intellectual project that focuses on watershed historical moments that shape & influence the Palestinian struggle for justice, freedom and return.â The summer 2024 class is an encampment spin-off. Abdulhadi claims SFSU abruptly cancelled this as a summer course, so she is offering this class without being compensated for it. It is open to all, though students may earn independent study credits.Â 

Summer camps in previous yearsâ¯Â 

This isnât the first time these types of programs have sparked concern. In 2013, the mainstream Jewish communityÂ  voiced concerns about new anti-Israel âsummer campsâ established to teach anti-Israel historical narratives and sow hatred for the Jewish state.Â  Led by American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), American Friends Service Committe (AFSC) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), these programs taught college students how to organize BDS campaigns and weaponize the Israel-Palestine conflict against Jewish and Zionist students.Â 

Jewish summer camps have not been immune to controversies around the conflict either. In 2018, IfNotNow clashed with Conservative movement youth group Camp Ramah, over how to teach the conflict.

In a March 2018 meeting, INN demanded the camp do more to âeducateâ about what they see as Israelâs occupation. Initially, Ramah director Mitch Cohen intimated Ramah was open to the idea of discussing the creation a broader Israel curriculum with Ramah directors and senior educators, âwith the goal of providing our teens and staff members at our camps and Israel programs with a full range of opinions on the conflict.â

In the interim between that meeting, and the official start of Ramah summer sessions, INN held a training for counselors in May 2018, leading to accusations it was attempting to âinfiltrateâ the camp with its programming.

The training materials from the May 2018 session include suggestions for activities and tactics ranging from saying Kaddish for everyone, presumably including both Israelis and Palestinians, every morning after people died in/around Gaza, to bringing up occupation in casual conversation, and potentially holding a âPeulat Shabbat on Occupation.â Additionally, the Liberation Syllabus includes a reading recommendation: âMen in the Sunâ, written by former Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine spokesperson and late author Ghassan Kanafani.

Finally, in June 2018 Ramah announced it would not agree to any of INNâs suggestions, with Cohen noting, âwe made it very clear to them that while liberal pro-Israel views on the conflict can be voiced and taught at camp, we do not allow any anti-Israel, anti-Semitic or anti-Zionist education at Ramah.â

The fight over Jewish summer camps became such a flashpoint, in part due to the nostalgia many carry from their days there, as well as the prominence Ramah camps have within the Jewish community. Summer camp is also considered one of the core ways the Jewish identity as well as affinity for Israel is formed and solidified. Therefore, the content of educational materials will always be subject to intense scrutiny.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/denial-and-distortion-hamas-led-october-7-attack-overview-false-narratives,"Since October 7, extremists and conspiracy theorists have promoted mis- and disinformation narratives about the reality of Hamasâs unprecedented, multi-pronged attack on Israel, attempting to deny or minimize the tragedy and shift the blame towards victims, a majority of whom were innocent civilians.

These misleading or false claims â many of which have proliferated on mainstream social media platforms â manipulate and distort the facts of the mass assault, invalidate the pain of victims and their families, and fuel hateful rhetoric that puts Jews and Israelis at risk of real-world harm.

TheÂ ADL Center on Extremism unpacked some prominent false narratives across social media.

FALSE NARRATIVE: Israel was responsible for the October 7 attack

On social media, anti-Israel conspiracy theorists and extremists have used a variety of claims to construct the broader false narrative that Israelânot Hamasâwas responsible for the mass killing spree on October 7, despite Hamas claiming responsibility for the attack and terrorists filming themselves committing the acts.

Hours after news broke of Hamasâs incursion into southern Israel, antisemitic and white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes suggested the attack was âsuspicious,â casting doubt that the Israeli government would have been caught off guard by Hamasâs attack, and alluding to how it could garner global sympathy for Israelâs own political benefit.

Antisemitic and white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes suggests the attacks on October 7 were âsuspicious.â (Telegram)

Â 

On social media platforms like X, users shared unfounded claims that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intentionally fired on their own civilians at the Supernova music festival on October 7 via âApache helicopters,â posting aerial footage of the supposed attack. This clip was used in attempts to discredit and minimize documented images of terribly burned victims and vehicles in and around the festival.

Anti-Zionist influencer âSyrian Girlâ shares conspiracy theory about âApache helicopters.â (X)

Â 

InÂ reality, the footage in question wasÂ released by the IDF on October 9 and shows the IDF engaging inÂ airstrikesÂ on Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip on October 8. Notably, there have been other reports about civilians inadvertently injured during Israelâs military response to the Hamas attack that day; IDF representatives have indicated that they wouldÂ investigate these matters further.

However, claims that the footage shows IDF helicopters firing on Supernova attendees are false, and there is ample visual evidence and testimony of HamasÂ attacking attendees and workers at the festival on October 7.

Some have claimed that the IDF knew about the attacks ahead of time and changed the location of the festival to put âhuman shieldsâ in front of a legitimate military target (The Reâim military base is just down the road from the Nova location) or to hide that it was staged military operation. There is no evidence to back this claim, which seems to have stemmed from the fact that the festival's location was changed two days before October 7. At the time, the IDF reluctantly approved the permit for the event â although some in the military did express concerns about possible rocket attacks.

An IDF investigation concluded Hamas likely did not have prior knowledge of the music festival, and spontaneously decided to attack. Conspiracists have concluded that much of the carnage from that day was perpetrated by the IDF.

FALSE NARRATIVE: Images showing aftermath of October 7 attacks were fabricated

In the days and weeks following October 7, images and videos showing the graphic and violent aftermath of Hamasâs attacks circulated on social media. Despite an abundance of evidence, conspiracy theorists quickly cast doubt on the validity and veracity of the photos and videos in question, suggesting instead that the content was fabricated by propagandists to exaggerate the severity of the attacks.

As officialsÂ released photos of the bloodied floors and beds inside Israeli homes where families were killed, conspiracy theorists suggested that Israel âstagedâ the graphic scenes, alleging that the blood looked fake or that photos of blood did not prove the existence of âreal victimsâ in Israel.Â 

False claims like this are not uncommon following wars, shootings and other forms of mass violence. There is ample evidence including photos and videos that explicitly show Hamas murdering Israeli civilians and foreign workers and nationals; journalists have even attendedÂ screenings of this footageâsome of which was taken directly from the bodycams of Hamas terrorists.

Â 

On X, 4chan, Telegram and other platforms, users suggested that images of burnt bodies and human remains wereÂ AI-generated, claiming that âAI-detector toolsâ flagged them as such. VariousÂ experts in generative AI and disinformation continue to warn against using these tools, many of which are still in their infancy and regularly produce false positives orÂ unreliable results.

Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE: Victims of October 7 were not sexually assaulted

Extremists, conspiracy theorists and even political commentators have declared that victims of October 7 are lying about being sexually assaulted by Hamas, despite widespreadÂ evidence and witness testimony of mass sexual violence and rape. These falseÂ narratives continue to circulate both online and offline.

Many influencers and activists wrote off the reported sexual assaults as âatrocity propagandaâ by Israel, which proponents claim is a tactic to distract the public from the war and to unfairly demonize Hamas.

Â 

Left-wing influencers such as political commentator and podcaster Briahna Joy Gray have also claimed that there is no evidence to support accounts of sexual assault following October 7.Â 

In December 2023, Gray wrote on X, âBelieve all womenâ was always an absurd overreach: woman [sic] should be heard, claims should be investigated, but evidence is required. The same is true of the allegations out of Israel. But also, this isnât a âbelieve womenâ scenario bc [sic] no female victims have offered testimony.â A few months later, on June 4, 2024, Gray hosted Yarden Gonenâthe sister of 23-year-old Romi Gonen, a hostage currently being held by Hamas â on an episode of The Hillâs âRising.â When Gonen begged Gray to believe the testimonies of women who were assaulted and kidnapped, Gray rolled her eyes in response.

Two days later, Gray announced that she had been fired from The Hill.

Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE: Hamas didnât kill any civilians on October 7 because there werenât anyâor they were killed unintentionally

Conspiracy theorists have attempted to absolve Hamas of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didnât target or kill any civilians on October 7. In some cases, some have claimed that there is no such thing as an Israeli civilian.

Immediately after the attacks, Hamas spokesperson Basem Naim flatly denied that Hamas killed civilians at all. On and off social media, anti-Israel activists and protestors defended Hamasâs actions, with some echoing actual HamasÂ talking points that imply that because the IDF is a conscription army, there cannot be aÂ truly civilian population, and therefore everyone is fair game as a potential military target.Â

Â 

Others such asÂ National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) claimed that âsettlersâ are not civilians in the âsense of international law, because they are military assets.âÂ Aaron Bushnell, whoÂ self-immolated in front of the Israeli embassy in DC on February 4, 2024, said in a Reddit post before his death that âThere are no Israeli âciviliansâ; or tourists who have no part in the oppression of Palestine.â

This interpretation of international humanitarian law is so mendacious that even Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi, who has justified the October 7 attack, rejected it.

Â 

FALSE NARRATIVE: Hostages taken by Hamas on October 7 were treated well and adored their captors

In late November, 105 of the 252 hostages abducted by Hamas were released during a temporary seven-day ceasefire, which ended on December 1. Footage of their release was captured by both Hamas and by journalists in Israel. The fate of many of the remaining hostages in Gaza is stillÂ unknown, though it is suspected that a large number are dead.

Since the November release, unfortunately, many have weaponized and distorted the footage to depict Hamas as gracious hosts, suggesting that hostages âadoredâ their captors.

On TikTok, X and other platforms, users pushed the idea that one of the 105 freed hostages â Israeli teenagerÂ Maya Regev â was in love with one of her captors due to a video clip in which she waves goodbye to a Hamas operative while getting into a van. Some interpreted her body language and expression as indicators of affection, showing images of her alongside phrases like, âFind yourself a woman who looks at you like this.â Regev testified to the Knesset Committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality in April 2024, that every female captive in Gaza âgoes through sexual harassment in some form or another.â Other freed hostages have given similar accounts.Â 

Anti-Zionist influencer Benjamin Rubinstein makes a suggestive comment about an Israeli hostage and her captors. (X)

Â 

Another false narrative of exceptional treatment centered around nine-year-old former hostage Emily Hand, whose behavior has changed drastically since her return from captivity. According to anÂ interview with her sister, Emily now offers her food to others around her before eating it herself, as hostages did while in captivity.

On social media, users took this information to mean that Hamas âtaught her manners,â downplaying the gravity of Emilyâs kidnapping and time as a hostage.

In June 2024, after an intense rescue effort, Almog Meir Jan was returned to Israel, later telling Israeli outlet Kan news that his captors âcynicallyâ made him aÂ birthday cake during his time in captivity. On social media, users suggested this was a kindness on the captorsâ part, and further evidence that Hamas terrorists treated hostages well, despite testimoniesÂ from former captives that they were malnourished and abused physically and psychologically.Â

Thank you-

I join you all here this morning on behalf of ADL, the oldest anti-hate organization in the United States, alongside my good friend Marc Morial, President of the National Urban League, and our partners - Assembly members Brian Cunningham, Nily Rozic, Grace Lee, Jennifer Rajkumar and Pastor Johnnie Green. In addition.Â  We are very grateful to Dr. Hazel Dukes of the NY NAACP, an icon of the civil rights movement for lending her strong words of support to this effort â few speak truth to power like Hazel Dukes.

Â 
But we gather this morning to say with one united voice:Â 

Enough is enough.

Right now, the Jewish community is facing a crisis of exploding antisemitism that has risen to the level of a national emergency.

We are experiencing a tsunami of anti-Jewish hate so severe it is drawing the attention of those at the highest levels of our state and federal governments, and we are grateful to see momentum here, today, behind a new initiative to #UnMaskHate.

Since October 7th, acts of antisemitism have surged to levels not seen in generations.

Our houses of worship, our communities, our students on campuses like Columbia, have experienced intimidation, harassment, marginalization, threats, and violence.

And letâs be honest about the facts.

They are being targeted not because they are cheering the war in Gaza. They are not. No one is.

They are not being targeting because they are representatives of the Israeli government. They are not. None of them are.

They are not being targeted because they believe in the right of the state of Israel to exist. We call that Zionism. And the overwhelming majority of Americans hold this view.

No, these people are being targeting simply because they are Jews.

They are being targeted for no other reason other than their faith, their ethnicity, their identitiesâ¦ and this is unacceptable. It is unimaginable. It is un-American.

This is not about political speech. Donât let anyone gaslight you.

To paraphrase Van Jones, you protest a policy, not a people.Â  You protest with your voice and your heart, not with clubs and bear spray.

Dr. King. John Lewis. Gloria Steinem. Harvey Milk. These were heroes who took risks. These were activists bravely confronted people in power and stood behind their ideas despite very real risks.

Today, these arenât activists. These are antagonists who cowardly confront people without power. These are hoodlums who conceal their identities so they menace and threaten their fellow Americans with impunity â in front of a synagogue, on a subway train, in front of a memorial to murdered teenagers.

Over the last several months we have seen such hateful conduct erupt into all-out violence â on our streets, on our campuses and beyond.

And, time and again, many of those who are engaged in this behavior wear masks to conceal their identities and to terrorize their targets.

They feel emboldened. Masks give them carte blanche to assault people, to vandalize buildings, to wreak havoc and yet to avoid any consequences for conduct that crosses the line.

Our community simply cannot afford to sit idly by and pretend that these are peaceful protestors exercising their rights. Nothing could be farther from the truth.

This isnât about infringing on the right to free speech.

This isnât about undermining the right to protest.

This isnât about preventing the right to assembly.

This isnât about inhibiting anyone from wearing medical masks for health and safety reasons.

However, this is about protecting the health and ensuring the safety of the vast majority of New Yorkers and Americans because no one should be terrorized. And, look, in the past the victims were African Americans, in the present the victims are American Jews, and in the future it could be any other marginalized community.

This is about isolating those individuals and groups who think it is permissible to harass and intimidate others simply because of who they are, how they pray or where theyâre from.

This is simply abhorrent.

These individuals are employing the same tactics of hate groups throughout history, from the Ku Klux Klan to the Proud Boys to the January 6 insurrectionists to Neo Nazis marching throughout the country over the past 12 months.

ADL has a legacy of countering such tactics, and today, we are committed to supporting this vital initiative to restore and strengthen New York's masked harassment and intimidation laws.

We are grateful that so many in New York, including our partners at the National Urban League, agree and are standing united on this issue affecting BOTH of our communities.

This campaign is about keeping all of us in marginalized communities safer and preventing masked intimidation and harassment against any community, the LGBTQ+, Black, Latino, and Asian American communities, who have all experienced spikes in hate crimes and hate-filled incidents in the last several years.

We thank our leaders here today who are supporting this effort, and strongly urge all New Yorkers to join this campaign to reinstate and strengthen New Yorkâs laws and ensure that those who hide their identities to harass and intimidate others, not only Jews, but anyone anywhere,Â  will be held accountable.Â 

Letâs launch this campaign.

Let's get the strongest legislation passed and send it to Governor Hochul.

Letâs set the bar for the rest of America to follow our lead.

Letâs Unmask Hate here in New York and across the nation.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/nearly-40-respondents-j7-countries-endorse-antisemitic-tropes-adl-survey,"Nearly 40% of respondents agreed with at least 6 of 12 antisemitic tropes.

According to a survey conducted across seven countries with large Jewish communities, a majority of respondents endorse the antisemitic âdual loyaltyâ allegation, agreeing that Jews are more loyal to Israel than their home countries. In the United States, this figure stands at 51%.

New York, NY, June 27, 2024â¦ A new survey from ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) polled antisemitic and anti-Israel attitudes across the J7 task force countries, home to some of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel.

The survey revealed that nearly 40 percent of respondents agreed with at least 6 antisemitic tropes. Among the findings, 56% of all respondents in the seven countries agreed with the age-old âdual loyaltyâ trope, or the notion that Jews are more loyal to Israel than to their home country, with percentages varying from 51% of those polled in the U.S., to 64% in Argentina and Germany.

The survey also reveals that belief in the trope that, âJews are responsible for most of the worldâs warsâ has increased as well, rising to 23 percent in Argentina (up from 13 percent in 2019); 19 percent in the United States (up from 5 percent in 2015); 17 percent in France, (up from 3 in 2023); and 17 percent in Germany, (up from 4 percent in 2023). The survey also found that the highest level of antisemitism occurs among Millennials (b. 1981-1996) in these countries, while Millennials and Generation Z (b. 1997-2012) hold the least favorable views of Israel, and Baby Boomers (b. 1946-1964) and the Silent Generation (b. 1928-1945) hold the most favorable views.

âAfter years of antisemitism mostly keeping to the fringes of society, it is alarming to see the percentage of people who harbor antisemitism and anti-Israel beliefs rising both in the United States and around the world,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âThis troubling trend demands our immediate attention and unified action. We will continue to work closely with our partners in the J7 Large Communitiesâ Task Force Against Antisemitism to record incidents and trends, combat extremism, and ensure the safety and security of Jewish communities globally.â

The findings also highlight a trend that as Israel is demonized, support of Hamas is being slowly normalized. On average, over 15 percent of respondents view Hamas âveryâ or âsomewhat favorably.â The favorable view of Hamas increases to 26 percent among Generation Z.

Additional survey findings include:

Respondents from the U.K. and Canada have the lowest national averages of antisemitic beliefs, while respondents from France and Argentina have the highest.
The second-most widely accepted trope across the J7 countries is that âJews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust.â Agreement with this trope varied, from 66 percent in Argentina and 55 percent in Germany to 28 percent in the United Kingdom and 33 percent in the United States.
Conspiratorial thinking is the single largest predictor of heightened antisemitism, even stronger than Holocaust denial.
Although Holocaust denial is less than 2 percent in J7 countries, Holocaust distortion â the belief that the Holocaust happened, but the number of Jews who died was greatly exaggerated â ranged between 5 and 15 percent, with the highest levels recorded in Argentina (15%) and the U.S. (11%).
Argentina (17%), France (13%) and the U.S. (12%) have the highest level of respondents who havenât heard about the Holocaust.

ADLâs Senior Vice President for International Affairs, Amb. Marina Rosenberg said, âThe tsunami of anti-Jewish hate unleashed worldwide after the Hamas atrocities of October 7 has reached unprecedented levels, reviving age-old antisemitic tropes. While antisemitism was on the rise even before Hamasâs brutal attack, the global surge in antisemitic attitudes and incidents since October 7 is unparalleled.â

ADLâs Antisemitism Index, an analytical tool for identifying respondents who harbor antisemitic attitudes, is a set of questions used to gauge adherence to traditional antisemitic tropes and stereotypes shown to lead to hostility and violence. The J7 survey polled antisemitic and anti-Israel attitudes across the J7 countries: Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. The study was fielded between Feb. 27 and March 8, 2024, by the ADL Center for Antisemitism Research in partnership with YouGov. The sample size of the study was 1,000 respondents per country, with a total of 7,000 respondents polled. The margin of error ranges between +/-3.15 and +/-4.03.

The J7, the Large Communitiesâ Task Force Against Antisemitism, was formed in response to increasing rates of antisemitism around the world and comprises major Jewish organizations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Argentina and Australia. In addition to top-level consultations, the J7 leads working groups comprised of subject matter experts from each community to develop strategies and action plans within areas such as policy and advocacy, tech policy, security, extremism and education against antisemitism.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-statement-surgeon-generals-call-warning-label-social-media,"New York, NY, June 17, 2024 ... ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today praised the U.S. Surgeon General's call for a warning label on social media platforms, saying that it was a welcome development that health professions are working alongside researchers, policymakers and advocates in thinking creatively about helping targets of online hate and harassment.

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, issued the following statement:

""TheÂ Surgeon Generalâs callÂ for a warning on social media is right: these platforms often seem like drugs, designed to hook users, create a dependency, and alter behavior â often for the worse. A warning labelÂ would dramatically highlight that hate and harassment is rampant on social media platforms, and teens are a particularly vulnerable group.Â Itâs a welcome development that health professionals like Dr. Murthy are working alongside researchers, policymakers, and advocates in thinking creatively about helping targets of hate and harassment online.""Â Â 

A newÂ ADL surveyÂ showedÂ that 50 percent of teens experienced hate and harassment online. Additionally, 59 percent of teens are worried about being harassed, threatened or otherwise targeted online. Teens are also more likely to agree or strongly agree that content that expresses hate (76 percent) or that encourages violence against a person or group because of their identity (79 percent) should be banned.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-issues-revised-report-card-grades-following-historic-antisemitic,"New York, NY, June 18, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced that it has issued revised grades for some schools assessed in itsÂ Campus Antisemitism Report Card, an initiative that assesses campus climate and administrative policies related to countering antisemitism on college campuses.

The tool, released in a beta version this past April, examined 85 institutions and assigned grades to provide campus leadership, parents, students, alumni and other key stakeholders a mechanism to evaluate the state of antisemitism on campus and how schools across the country are responding. In the initial release, 2 schools received an âA,â 17 schools received a âB,â 29 schools received a âC,â 24 schools received a âD,â and 13 schools received an âFâ grade.

Since the release of the report card, the campus climate at colleges and universities across the country has been fraught. In recent months, students have launched hostile anti-Israel encampments, seized school buildings, and in some cases, assaulted staff. In many instances, activists engaged in antisemitic harassment, intimidation and violence.Â  To date, ADL has tracked more than 2,600 arrests.

Less than half (46%) of Jewish students reported feeling physically safe on their campuses during the first half of the fall semester of the 2023-2024 school year. Now, the surge in protests has intensified anti-Jewish hate, leaving many Jewish students feeling threatened and, in some cases, unsafe. While some college and university administrations have met the moment and implemented additional protections, many have not.

To account for this increase in hostility toward Jewish students, ADL re-assessed each of the 85 schools included in the Report Card, taking into account recent escalations, the impact on levels of antisemitism on campus, and response from university leadership.Â After the reassessment, grades changed in several instances. Accordingly, the grade distribution is now: 2 schools received an âA,â 18 schools received a âB,â 32 schools received a âC,â 24 schools received a âD,â and 9 schools received an âFâ grade.

Although their grades did not change, several schools were commended by ADL for appropriate handling of the recent spike in hostile anti-Zionist activity and the challenging situation of unauthorized encampments on campus.

On the first day of the unauthorized encampment, Arizona State University (ASU) issued numerous warnings before clearing the encampment and arresting 70+ individuals, most of whom were not students. To keep the campus community informed, ASU issued aÂ statement outlining exactly which policies had been violated and the consequences for students who had been arrested.
Following repeated calls for protestors to remove the encampment, the University of Florida called in the police, leading to the arrests of several students. The University subsequently released a decisiveÂ statement: âThe University of Florida is not a daycare, and we do not treat protesters like children. They knew the rules, they broke the rules, and theyâll face the consequences.â
At the University of Texas, AustinÂ (UT Austin), protestors at the encampment were repeatedly told to leave. Protestors also allegedly sent threats to the University. In response, UT Austin and partner law enforcement agencies quickly removed the encampment and made 79 arrests, including 45 individuals who were not affiliated with the university. Weapons confiscated from protestors reportedly included guns, mallets and chains.
At Washington University in St. Louis, the administration asked protestors to disperse multiple times on the day that the encampment was set up. When protestors didnât leave, The administration subsequently released a strongÂ  denouncing the actions of the protestors and outlining the steps taken by the university and the reasons for police involvement. Several faculty members involved in the protests have been placed on leave.
A few days after the encampment was set up, President Alivisatos of the University of Chicago published aÂ statement saying âOn Monday, I stated that we would only intervene if what might have been an exercise of free expression blocks the learning or expression of others or substantially disrupts the functioning or safety of the university. Without an agreement to end the encampment, we have reached that point.â On May 7th, President Alivisatos published anÂ op-ed outlining why the administration chose to dismantle the encampment, stating: âStudents demanded that we side against Israel, violating the core principle of institutional neutrality.â
At Emory University, an encampment was rapidly cleared by law enforcement, leading to a number of arrests, including of outside protestors. Subsequent protests led to a number of injuries to protestors and police officers. Following the de-escalation of the situation, President Fenves released aÂ statement noting: âI am saddened by what took place at Emory yesterday... As Emory community members continue to express themselves and protest, we are committed to working with students and faculty, open expression observers, and the EPD to facilitate their peaceful expression. However, we will not tolerate vandalism, violence, or any attempt to disrupt our campus through the construction of encampments. These actions are counter to our values, and they disrupt the core purpose of the university and its educational and research missions.â
At Tulane University, the New Orleans Police Department and Louisiana State Police dismantled a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus, arresting 14 protesters, including 2 students, and suspending 7 Tulane students for participating in the encampment on university property. âWe fully support the freedom of speech and assembly,â TulaneâsÂ statement said. âThese rights must be exercised, however, in a manner that does not disrupt our academic mission, compromise the safety or the free speech of others, or hinder support systems for our students.â

âWhen we released these grades last month, we did not dare to imagine how much more challenging this school year would get for Jewish students,â said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. âThe past few weeks have been marked by an alarming surge in anti-Jewish hate connected to the encampments and other on-campus protests, putting studentsâ safety at risk and even prompting some schools to cancel graduation. The end of the school year should be a joyous time for students and their families, and it is completely unacceptable that some university leaders have let the situation get this out of hand.â

This re-assessment was deemed necessary because of the extreme volatility of the current campus climate. Going forward, ADL will offer universities the opportunity to submit updated information in October if they wish to have their grades re-assessed.Â  ADL will continue to update the Report Card on an annual basis each April.

The Report Card is a vital part of ADLâs Not On My Campus campaign, calling on U.S. colleges and universities to commit to a no tolerance policy for antisemitism. The Not On My CampusÂ website provides online tools and resources for students, parents, and alumni, empowering them to demand more from college leadership, and building collective action to hold schools accountable for their inaction.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/gai-music-creation-tool-suno-has-been-weaponized-promote-hate,"Extremists and online trolls are using Suno, an increasingly influential Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) music creation tool, to make songs promoting hate speech, racist stereotypes, calls for violence and extremist rhetoric.

The tool, created by Suno AI, became popular in 2023 after the company announced a partnership with Microsoft.Â 

Today, many users employ the tool for innocuous purposes. However, the ADL Center on Extremism has discovered a vast library of disturbing songs created with Sunoâhighlighting the critical need for stronger content moderation guidelines and heightened awareness of the myriad ways in which bad actors are weaponizing GAI.Â 

How Suno Works & How Extremists Use ItÂ 

Suno generates vocal and instrumental tracks in less than a minuteâalongside âalbum artâ and a song titleâbased on user prompts of 200 characters or less.

Â 

Much like other GAI image and video tools, the technology behind GAI music creation programs like Suno is constantly improving, making it easier to produce ever-more convincing songs. This means harmful rhetoric can be quickly transformed into viral content thatâs easily and speedily disseminated.

Suno does employ some safeguards around content moderation. For example, the program refuses to respond when prompts are explicitly violent or hateful. However, problematic content still slips through the cracks, and extremists use workarounds to avoid any content limitations, which they subsequently share in online spaces favored by other extremists and trolls.

Among those âtips:â âDog whistlesâ and coded language that allow you to skirt moderation. For example, one user on the extremist-friendly Kiwi Farms forum bragged about tricking Suno into producing a song about âwhite powerââa common white supremacist termâby submitting a prompt for a song âabout a new clean energy source called âwhite power.ââ

Â 

Another example from a far-right Telegram channel shows how users exploit Suno using deliberate misspellingsâin this case, to suggest sarcastically that they canât wait to âdyeâ for Israel. This plays on the conspiracy theory that the U.S. is secretly planning to draft citizens into a world war to defend Israel against Hamas (and therefore âdieâ for Israel).

Â 

Suno users capitalize on these tips, avoiding content moderation while creating songs celebrating hateful and extremist themes and rhetoric.Â 

Antisemitism and Glorification of the Holocaust

A 4chan user shared a Suno song called âSquatting for Hitler,â with lyrics that include âthe Fuhrerâ and âthis is the white manâs nation.â Other lyrics are misogynistic and racist.

Â 

On a Telegram channel dedicated to offensive GAI content, a user shared a blatantly antisemitic song called âMy Little Chamber,â which references Holocaust death camps with lyrics about a âstriped PJ shirt,â and referring to the chamber as âa final solution to all of my woes.â

Â 

Another Suno song shared on 4chan (alongside an antisemitic and racist meme) is titled âThe ZOGââan acronym used by white supremacists and antisemites that stands for âZionist Occupied Governmentâ and alludes to their belief that the U.S. government is controlled by Jews.

Â 

Notably, the song lyrics themselves use terms like âthe kites,â âTHE SOGâ and âthe juice,â presumably as thinly veiled code for âthe kikes,â âTHE ZOGâ and âthe Jews.â The song promotes the antisemitic trope that Jews are inherently greedy and wield disproportionate global control.

Â 

White Supremacy, Racism & Xenophobia

In a Telegram chat affiliated with the antisemitic and white supremacist hate group the Goyim Defense League (GDL), one user shared a song that uses misspellings and dog whistles to trick the song into using the slurs ân*****sâ and âkikes.â

Â 

Other users deployed a similar method to make the audio say ân*****s to the left of me,â along with other racist slurs and tropes.

Â 

One 4chan user generated a German-language song opposing the presence of âforeigners,â using the xenophobic and white supremacist slogan, âDeutschland den Deutschen, AuslÃ¤nder raus!"" (""Germany for the Germans, foreigners out!"").Â 

This slogan has recently regained traction among extremists and xenophobic groups, thanks to a viral video showing Germans singing along to a song that features the phrase.

In a Telegram channel promoting GAI hate content, a user shared a song called âWuhan Blues,â which includes bigoted anti-AANHPI tropes and stereotypes about the COVID-19 pandemic.

Songs About Violence

Some songs generated by Suno celebrate or support acts of violence. In the example below, the lyrics glorify and praise the white supremacist mass shooter Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 people in 2019 during his attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Â

Policy RecommendationsÂ 

Sunoâs current terms of service highlight the following guidelines for using their tool: âYou agree to not use the Service to: generate, submit, upload, transmit or otherwise make available any Submissions or Output thatâ¦is (or is used for or in connection with any purpose, initiative, activity, product or service that is) unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, excessively violent, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable.âÂ 

While Suno effectively prevents outputs for some overt hate and violence prompts, it fails to detect the nefarious methods that either bypass existing safeguards or take advantage of the fact that some safeguards simply donât exist.

Although Sunoâs guidelines cover a broad spectrum of violative content, additional issues must be addressed to properly mitigate harmful content created with the tool.Â Â 

Policy recommendations:Â 

Create clearer and more specific terms of service violations about content related to hate, extremism and violence.Â 

Invest in in-house trust and safety personnel and violative content detection on par with other GAI platforms, like ChatGPT or DALL-E

Build behavior discouraging mechanisms into Suno (for example, songs explaining why it wonât respond to hateful prompts) and evaluate effectiveness

Collaborate with civil society and industry partners to make the model more resilient to exploitation

Making user prompts public could demystify some of the coded language in problematic lyrics

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/how-antisemites-extremists-and-conspiracy-theorists-are-exploiting-anti-vax,"While the days of lockdowns and social distancing are behind us, anti-vaccine narratives remain prevalent on social media, and extremists continue to exploit these sentiments to recruit new members, raise money and mainstream their beliefs. Many extremists view anti-vaxxers as a massive pool of potential fresh recruits and followers primed for the âred pill.âÂ Â Â 

Â 
While the mainstreaming of once-fringe anti-vaccine beliefs poses obvious risks to public health, it also endangers society more broadly. Anti-vaccine beliefs are strongly associated with lack of trust in the government, media and public healthâinstitutions that serve as bedrocks of any democracy. Extremistsâ exploitation of anti-vaccine sentiments serves to strengthen extremist networks by creating opportunities for further recruitment, radicalization and, in extreme cases, violence targeting healthcare workers and public officials.Â Â 

Â 

Extremists appear poised to exploit concerns about vaccine policies and mask mandates during the 2024 presidential election cycle â and during any surges in COVID-19, flu and respiratory virus cases. Drawing on baseless theories that the COVID-19 pandemic was âplanned,â some conspiracy theorists and extremists have alleged that âglobal elitesâ and the âDeep Stateâ are conspiring to release a new âplandemicâ known as âDisease Xâ later in 2024, timed to interfere with the presidential election.

Using anti-vax beliefs to recruit and mainstream hateÂ 

For many extremists, the COVID-19 pandemicâand relatively quick vaccine rolloutâreinforced long-standing fears about government control and efforts to âdepopulateâ the world, with some tying the vaccines into long-standing conspiracy theories about âwhite genocideâ or a New World Order. They viewed the pandemic and vaccines as tools of manipulation by âglobal elites,â the government or â in some cases â Jews to strip people of their freedoms and bodily autonomy.Â Â 

Â 

Animated by these grievances and longstanding distrust of the government, mainstream media and âbig pharma,â some extremists have attempted to find common ground with anti-vaccine activists and the broader public, exploiting anti-vaccine sentiments to recruit new members and promote antisemitic, racist and Sinophobic conspiracy theories about the virusâs origins and the âtrue purposeâ of vaccines.Â Â 

Â 

Extremists incorporating anti-vax sentiments into propagandaÂ Â 

Â 

Since 2020, various white supremacist groups have incorporated anti-vaccine and COVID-19-related messaging into their propaganda.Â Â 

Â 

The Goyim Defense League (GDL), a network of antisemitic provocateurs and white supremacists, has distributed fliers incorporating antisemitic anti-vaccine and COVID-19-related messages on at least 188 occasions since September 2021. For example, following reports that 2024 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during a July 2023 event, suggested COVID-19 had been âengineeredâ to spare Ashkenazi Jews, GDL created a flier featuring his quote along with the message, âDoes COVID-19 target Blacks and Whites?âÂ Â 

Examples of antisemitic GDL fliers related to COVID-19 and vaccines.Â 

Â 

Other white supremacist groups â such as the National Socialist Movement (NSM), Active Clubs, Patriot Front, the New Jersey European Heritage Association (NJEHA) and Hundred Handers â have also incorporated anti-vaccine and COVID-19-related messaging into their propaganda since 2020.Â Â Â

Â 

During a January 2022 demonstration in Kissimmee, Florida, NSM and GDL members displayed a banner that read âVax the Jews,â a nod to conspiracy theories that COVID-19 vaccines are being used to kill people as part of a sinister global depopulation effort. Members of GDL and NatSoc Florida (NSF) also projected âVax the Jewsâ and other antisemitic messages on buildings in Orlando, Florida, on New Yearâs Eve 2022.Â

Â 

Promoting anti-vax sentiments at rallies and conferencesÂ Â 

Â 

Seeking additional ways to inject their views into the mainstream and find potential recruits, some extremists participated in various anti-vaccine and lockdown demonstrations across the country.Â Â 

Â 

Extremists and QAnon supporters have frequently participated in far-right political conferences that prominently feature anti-vax narratives, such as the âReawaken Americaâ tour in 2023. These events allowed convicted January 6th insurrectionist Dr. Simone Gold and Ann Vandersteel, a QAnon influencer and sovereign citizen, to rub elbows, and to hobnob with elected officials, political candidates and advisors to former President Trump, like Michael Flynn and Eric Trump. The appearance of political leaders and elected officials at these types of events lends legitimacy to anti-vaccine and other conspiratorial beliefs, helping to normalize and further propel them into the mainstream.Â 

Â 

Various far-right extremists â including Three Percenters, Groypers, sovereign citizens, Proud Boys and QAnon adherents â were among the organizers and participants in the 2022 Canadian Freedom Convoy and U.S. Peopleâs Convoy, which protested COVID-19 vaccine mandates, among other anti-government grievances. The late QAnon influencer Michael âNegative48â Protzman and a group of his followers joined the Peopleâs Convoy in March 2022, teaching a fake version of numerology, or gematria, to convoy participants in hopes of attracting new people to their cause.Â Â

Â 

The January 2022 Defeat the Mandates Rally in Washington, D.C. â arguably the largest anti-vaccine demonstration in the U.S. in recent years â featured prominent Nation of Islam (NOI) member Rizza Islam as a speaker and drew members of the Proud Boys and white supremacist Groyper movement.Â Â 

Â 

Disrupting public forumsÂ 

Â 

Extremists have also promoted anti-vaccine beliefs at public forums such as city council meetings and legislative hearings, looking for opportunities to connect with like-minded citizens and harassing officials over their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and promotion of vaccines.Â Â 
Â 
On March 12, 2024, individuals associated with the Nevada county assembly, a sovereign citizen group, served members of the Nevada County, California Board of Supervisors with frivolous pseudo-legal documents demanding they vacate their positions within three days due to their promotion of the COVID-19 vaccines.Â Â 
Â 
âWe also demand that you immediately cease mandating all vaccinations, COVID-19 vaccinations, COVID-19 testing and masks to be worn and publicly broadcast your direction to the people through mass media,â the groupâs representative told members of the board.Â 

Â 

During a September 6, 2023, Marathon County, Wisconsin Health & Human Services Committee meeting, white supremacist and GDL associate Christopher Wood, who is currently running for mayor of Wausau, Wisconsin, read aloud the names of various Jewish figures who work for the CDC, Pfizer and Blackrock, implying Jews are behind the âCOVID agenda.âÂ Â 

Â 

âI think a lot of people are well aware that COVID is a scam. Well, you know, the whole practice of it, everyone understands there's disease, but the fear that they've pushed is to such a great extent to try to control and manipulate us. So, I'm going to talk about who's actually behind it because not too many people want to do that,â Wood said.Â Â

Black nationalist Ayo Kimathi, known online as âIrritated Genie,â railed against vaccines during the Washington, D.C. city councilâs June 22, 2023, meeting, accusing council members of willingly participating in âgenocide against children in the United States of America.âÂ Â 

Â 

Through viral propaganda filmsÂ 

Â 

Extremists have also used the power of film to propel anti-vaccine views into the mainstream, producing and starring in several viral vaccine misinformation films in the years since the pandemic. These films, which have garnered millions of views, presented extremists with newfound platforms and fame â and an opportunity to normalize their hateful and conspiratorial beliefs.Â Â 

Â 

The Nation of Islamâs Rizza Islam was featured in âPlandemic 3: The Great Awakening,â the third installment of Mikki Willisâ conspiratorial series about the COVID-19 pandemic, released in June 2023. Islam attended the filmâs February 2024 Santa Monica Film Festival screening and accepted its âBest Feature Documentaryâ award.Â

Â 

California-based Nation of Islam Student Minister Tony Muhammad co-produced the anti-vaccine documentary âMedical Racism: The New Apartheidâ with RFK Jr. and fellow anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Kevin Jenkins. The film, which targeted Black viewers and claimed the U.S. government sought to harm ethnic minorities through COVID-19 vaccines, had its first public showing at NOIâs Savioursâ Day weekend in February 2021, ahead of its official premiere in March 2021.Â 

Â 

Meanwhile, âDied Suddenly,â which was released by far-right conspiracy theorist and antisemite Stew Peters in 2022, promotes the false claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause healthy individuals to develop deadly blood clots, suggesting this is proof that âglobal elitesâ are using the vaccines to depopulate the planet as part of a broader conspiracy to establish a global totalitarian regime. Conspiracy theorists have promoted this claim since the virus first emerged in 2020.Â Â 

Â 

Despite being repeatedly debunked by fact checkers and medical experts, the claims promoted in âDied Suddenlyâ have gained a significant foothold. On X, formerly known as Twitter, the hashtag #DiedSuddenly has emerged as a rallying cry for anti-vaccine activists and conspiracy theorists who use it to promote baseless claims that the COVID-19 vaccine caused the deaths and illnesses of various individuals.Â 

Â 

Data compiled by the ADL Center on Extremism shows that #DiedSuddenly was mentioned over 2.4 million times between November 21, 2022, and December 31, 2023, with posts mentioning the hashtag receiving more than 4.9 million likes and 2.5 million retweets.Â 
Â 
Using anti-vax beliefs to generate revenueÂ 

Â 

Extremists and conspiracy theorists have also profited from anti-vaccine beliefs, leveraging them to sell merchandise and help people obtain religious exemptions from vaccines or alternative COVID-19 treatments.Â Â 

Â 

The Goyim Defense League sells several conspiratorial anti-vaccine and COVID-19-related t-shirts via its online shop, drawing upon antisemitic conspiracy theories that the pandemic was a âhoaxâ orchestrated by Jews and that the vaccines are dangerous.Â 

Examples of GDLâs anti-vaccine shirtsÂ 

Â 

According to Media Matters researcher Alex Kaplan, in 2021, QAnon influencer Jeffrey Pedersen, known online as âintheMatrixxxâ, collaborated with a religious ministry to help Americans obtain religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The exemption letters were $17 for individuals using Pedersenâs referral code, a nod to the QAnon conspiracy theory (Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet).Â Â 

Â 

In the early days of the pandemic, former QAnon promoter Dustin Nemos sold colloidal silver ($22.95 for one fluid ounce or $43.95 for four fluid ounces) as a supposed preventative treatment for COVID-19 via an online store; the FDA has warned that colloidal silver is not safe or effective for treating diseases and can cause serious side effects.Â Â 

Â 

Far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has also hawked a range of dietary supplements and creams as treatments to prevent and cure COVID-19. In March 2020, New York Attorney General Letitia James sent Jones a cease and desist notice, ordering him to immediately stop âselling and marketing products as a treatment or cure for the coronavirus.âÂ 
Â 

How anti-vaccine narratives inform extremist violence and criminal activityÂ 

Â 

Over the past few years, dozens of healthcare workers and public officials have been harassed, threatened and even assaulted for administering or promoting vaccines, not just in the United States, but around the globe. This activity has been driven in part by vaccine mis/disinformation and conspiracy theoriesâwhich paint vaccines as inherently dangerous.Â Â 

Â 

On February 4, 2024, Brian McGann Jr. allegedly beat his father, Brian McGann Sr., to death in a rage after learning his father had received a vaccine. He was charged with first-degree murder; a family friend told investigators that McGann Jr. was a âdelusional conspiracy theorist.âÂ Â 

Â 

In August 2022, Romana Didulo, a Canadian QAnon figure who falsely claims to be the âQueen of Canada,â and around thirty of her supporters gathered in Peterborough, Ontario, to carry out âcitizens arrestsâ on members of the Peterborough Police Service, who they claimed had committed âtreasonâ for enforcing COVID-19 mandates. Several of Diduloâs supporters were arrested during the incident, which turned violent. Diduloâs followers have also been known to harass healthcare workers and public officials on other occasions, inspired by her fake ""decrees"" ordering the military to confiscate COVID-19 vaccines and instructing followers to arrest healthcare workers for administering COVID-19 vaccines to children.

In August 2023, Tim Dever and Darris Moody were sentenced to ten years and two years in prison, respectively, on interstate threat charges for sending phony âwrits of executionâ to elected officials in North Carolina. Dever was one of the co-founders of the Peopleâs Bureau of Investigation (PBI). This QAnon-influenced sovereign citizen group sought to âexposeâ and investigate government corruption in the United States by instructing members to âserveâ fictitious writs against public officials. The fictitious writs accused government officials of various âcrimes,â such as promoting COVID-19 vaccines.Â Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/valuable-childrens-books-about-power-words,"The importance of words cannot be overstated. Words are powerful and impactful. Words matter.Â 

Â 

Biased, offensive and hateful words are used in our political discourse, in online spaces, in the streets and one-on-one conversations, in workplaces and in schools and classrooms. These words cause great hurt and harm to those targeted by them and they can bring about tension which cause the situation to escalate. On the other hand, words that are supportive, that advocate for allyship and inclusivity, that extend care and concern, have great power to help and to heal those wounds. It is also important to be mindful that the words we use do not have to be spoken out loud and not everyone speaks aloud to communicate. Communication diversity includes American Sign Language (ASL), as Derek uses in You Donât Know Everything, Jilly P., and a tablet that the boy in A Day with No Words uses to share his thoughts with others.Â 

Â 

In schools and classrooms, words are used every day that can be harmful or helpful. One way to discuss the importance of words with young people is to read a book together and talk about it. There are many relevant and compelling childrenâs books that can open the door to conversations with young people about the power of words and language. These picture and chapter books all include discussion guides for educators and families.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/levels-online-hate-and-harassment-remain-high-adl-survey-finds,"New York, NY, June 10, 2024 â¦ More than half of all Americans - 56 percent - report experiencing online hate or harassment in their lifetimes, continuing an upward trend, according to ADLâs sixth annual Survey of Online Hate and Harassment â the highest rate since 2020.

At a time whenÂ antisemitic incidents are at historic levels, 34 percent of Jewish adults who were harassed online reported being targeted because of their religion in the past 12 months. In addition, 63 percent felt less safe than they did last year, and 41 percent have changed their online behavior to avoid being recognized as Jewish.

Rates of hate and harassment were highest among transgender (63 percent), LGBTQ+ (49 percent) and Muslim (47 percent) adults. The rate of harassment experienced last year was exceptionally high among transgender people, including 45 percent who experienced severe harassment.

Harassment of teens ages 13-17 remained steady at 50 percent this past year. Additionally, 59 percent of teens are worried about being harassed, threatened or otherwise targeted online. Teens are also more likely to agree or strongly agree that content that expresses hate (76 percent vs. 68 percent a year ago)Â or that encourages violence against a person or group because of their identity (79 percentÂ vs. 72 percent) should be banned.Â  Â 

âThe hate weâre seeing online, doesnât stay online â it causes real harm and violence in peoplesâ lives. Itâs high time everyone stepped up to keep communities and marginalized groups safe from hate and harassment,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âDespite many promises made by online platforms, hate and harassment are still plaguing the internet. Policymakers and big tech companies must deliver on their commitments to address hate and harassment online.âÂ 

Of those who reported being harassed, 61 percentÂ indicated harassment took place on Facebook. Harassment remained at 27 percent on X (formerly Twitter) and rose on WhatsApp (up to 25 percent from 14 percent in 2023) and on Telegram (up to 13 percent from 7 percent in 2023).

âThe hate and harassment being reported on online platforms is horrendous; itâs getting worse, and itâs likely only the tip of the iceberg,â said Daniel Kelley, Director of Strategy and Operations and Interim Head, ADL Center for Technology and Society. âEven more concerning is the fact that this deluge of hate is happening as the platforms continue to scale back their content moderation teams and thereâs zero transparency surrounding how tech companies are enforcing their own rules.âÂ 
Â 

The survey of 2,479 individuals was conducted from January 19 through February 5, 2024, by YouGov, a leading public opinion and data analytics firm, on behalf of the ADL Center for Technology and Society. The results are weighted and representative of all Americans 18 and older. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points among the total sample.

The youth survey of 532 13â17-year-old teens was also conducted on behalf of ADL by YouGov from January 25 through February 5, 2024. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of youth is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/hate-and-harassment-are-rampant-neighborhood-facebook-pages-and-groups-new,"New York, NY, June 6, 2024 â¦Â  Researchers at the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center for Technology and Society (CTS) found that some Facebook groups in local communities have become toxic sites of harassment, particularly identity-based harassment against Jews, women, LGBTQ+ advocates, immigrants, and people of color.

Through interviews with community members, targets of the harassment and other stakeholders, combined with online observation, content analysis, and data scraping, ADL investigated hate and harassment occurring on Facebook groups or pages in three local regions. In all three cases, the harassersâoften part of the local political establishment, whether anonymous or notâexcluded those they perceived as threatening outsiders to consolidate their control over civic life.

The three communities reviewed by ADL in this study included a suburban county outside New York City, where neighbors organized against a growing Orthodox Jewish community; a town near Boston, where backlash ensued when a woman of color won a municipal election; and in small-town Ohio, where a local reproductive rights activist was harassed and hounded out of town by extremist groups while running for city council. These incidents all shared a common feature: hate-based harassment taking place on neighborhood Facebook pages and groups.

Through these case studies, ADL identified a shared pattern of harassment:

An event or series of events unfold when someone from a marginalized group gets involved in local civic life, surfacing tensions over demographic change.
These tensions erupt in existing or newly created community Facebook Pages and Groups, involving online hate and harassment, often anonymously.
Disgruntled community members pursue public actions and other forms of online and offline harassment.

Unlike other forms of online harassment, such asÂ trolling campaigns where targets donât know their perpetrators, targets of local harassment are more likely to interact with their harassers in everyday life, inhabiting the same town or region, and often know people in common, making this form ofÂ harassment even more harmful.

âHarassment on neighborhood and local groups and pages can be terribly damaging for targeted individuals and families, leading not only to emotional harm but also to potential physical violence and withdrawal from participating in civic life,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âAddressing online harassment in local communities requires concrete steps from platforms and policymakers and we are calling on all responsible parties to take action now to protect all communities.â

ADL has previously found that a majority of Americans experience harassment on Facebook, according to CTSâs 2023Â Survey of Online Hate and Harassment. Facebook is the most popular social media platform in the U.S. by number of users; even still, the number of people who report harassment there is out of proportion to its popularity: 54 percent of those polled were harassed on Facebook, twice that of X/Twitter, the next most likely platform where online harassment happens. Facebook provides very limited data access, making it understudied compared to other platforms (seeÂ ADLâs 2023 report on data accessibility for evaluations of each major platform).

In addition to interviews and qualitative analysis for the three case studies, ADL researchers analyzed the quantity of antisemitic content on Facebook communities where harassment took place, using ADLâs own antisemitism classifier. Findings supported the firsthand experiences of those interviewed: the reported Facebook communities had 5-10 times as much antisemitic content as control pages.

âYou are more likely to be harassed on Facebook than on other platforms, yet this harassment is rarely visible to researchers,â said Jordan Kraemer, Director of Policy and Research, ADL Center for Technology and Society. âFacebook has become a key platform for neighborhood news and discussion groups, serving as a new âpublic square.â However, harassment remains rampant and reporting inefficient, with the platform rarely if ever taking action to protect the targets.â

The report includes detailed recommendations for tech companies and government:

For tech companies:

Close anonymity loopholes.
Use network analysis to detect local harassment campaigns.
Provide user-friendly tools to report & prevent harassment.
Make transparency reports accessible and understandable to non-experts.
Give greater access to data for researchers and third-party auditors.

For government:

Federal legislators and other state lawmakers should follow the example of California and to enact similar policies to Californiaâs A.B. 587, a landmark bill requiring publication of aspects of platformsâ terms of services and the actions they take against content that violates those terms.Â 
Support and urge passage of current legislative efforts that aim to address important issues highlighted throughout this report
Lawmakers should enhance access to justice for victims of online abuse.

Beyond platform policies and enforcement, broader changes are needed in local communities to support targets, educate law enforcement, and build trust in public institutions. Targets need better information on how to respond to local online harassment, such as how to document it, report it to platforms and law enforcement, and how to protect their safety, such as increasing privacy protections on their social media accounts. Local law enforcement too needs to understand local laws, the nature of online harassment, and their jurisdiction, to provide meaningful help for targets.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-files-fec-complaint-against-jvps-political-action-committee-alleging,"New York, NY, June 3, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) charging Jewish Voice for Peaceâs (JVP) political fundraising arm with numerous violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act and FEC regulations. Jewish Voice for Peace is a fringe anti-Israel group dedicated to the elimination of the state of Israel as a Jewish state despite nearly half of the worldâs Jewish population residing in the country.

The complaint against JVP Action PAC (JVP PAC) and its treasurer cites numerous financial discrepancies in the political action committeeâs income and expense reports, and charges it with illegally accepting prohibited corporate contributions and donations in excess of federal limits.

âSimply put, JVP PACâs numbers do not add up, and despite repeated warnings from the FEC, the PAC has failed to correct the record,â said Steven C. Sheinberg, ADL Chief Legal Officer. âMoreover, while JVP PAC holds itself out to the public as a mechanism for supporting candidates for federal elected office, a significant majority of the PACâs spending did not go to candidates or have any apparent direct connection to a federal campaign. The public deserves to know where this money is going, and the FEC must hold JVP PAC accountable for violations of the law.â

Despite being registered with the FEC as a ânonconnectedâ committee, JVP PAC describes itself as the âelectoral wingâ of JVP Action, which itself is the 501(c)(4) affiliate ofÂ Jewish Voice for Peace, a fringe, radical anti-Israel activist group that advocates for a complete economic, cultural, and academic boycott of the state of Israel.

While JVP PAC reported $82,956 in expenditures for 2020 through 2023, only $1,775, or a little over 2 percent, was contributed to federal candidates for office. Instead, a significant portion of the spending was earmarked to paying âlegalâ and other noncampaign related costs, including a $19,656 payment for âlegal servicesâ made to an insurance firm that doesnât appear to practice law.

The PACâs financial filings show a âpattern of noncomplianceâ that has resulted in four requests for additional information from the FEC in 2022 and 2023, according to the complaint, but JVP PAC has thus far failed to respond to the FEC and has taken no steps to amend their reports.

The complaint also alleges the JVP PAC has a pattern of accepting in-kind support from JVP Action without paying for the market value of the support, potentially resulting in a prohibited in-kind corporate contribution.

âThe PACâs reports show a number of financial discrepancies, discrepancies in cash on hand from report to report, and other reporting errors,â the complaint states. JVP PAC also appears to have repeatedly accepted contributions in excess of federal limits.

ADL urged the FEC to conduct an immediate investigation and to levy appropriate sanctions for any and all violations, including civil penalties âsufficient to deter future violationsâ and an injunction prohibiting future violations.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/fight-until-victory-speakers-guests-declare-full-support-terrorism-peoples,"As the âPeopleâs Conference for Palestineâ got underway in Detroit, MI on May 24, the packed audience cheered as Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) organizer and conference MC Mohammed Nabulsi opened by offering âsalutations to our people in Palestine and to our noble, steadfast Resistance.â Nabulsi garnered further enthusiastic applause when he urged âeternal glory to our martyrsâ and called to âliberate every inch of Palestine, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.â

The conference, which took place from May 24â26, 2024 at the Huntington Place convention center and drew thousands of attendees both in person and online, was organized by many of the leading groups in the U.S. anti-Zionist movement, offering insight into the strategies and goals of the most influential forces driving a movement that has gained increasingly widespread and mainstream support as the Israel-Hamas war has dragged on.Â 

In addition to his praise for the so-called Palestinian âResistanceâ â a euphemistic reference to the various terrorist groups responsible for violent attacks against Israel â Nabulsi explained that conference organizers sought to âcraft a path forward that truly brings the Zionist state and its military and its imperialist backers to their knees.â

Nabulsiâs opening remarks set the tone for the rest of the weekendâs keynote and plenary sessions, which were rife with overt support for U.S.-designated terror groups and the Hamas-led October 7 attack, extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric including open calls for the destruction of the State of Israel, and classic antisemitic tropes. These types of extreme sentiments were the defining characteristic of the conference and echoed repeatedly throughout the weekend.Â  The event not only gave a massive platform to those who endorse violence against Israel, but fully embraced and amplified those voices.

The conference also highlighted how such rhetoric â which at one time may have been perceived as fringe or espoused only by the more extreme segments of the anti-Zionist movement â has come to represent the movement broadly and has been accepted by many mainstream critics of Israel and Zionism.

The use of increasingly extreme language, which the ADL Center on Extremism had observed among many anti-Zionist organizations before October 7, has notably progressed since the start of the war.

High-profile elected officials who spoke at the three-day event included U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib; British Member of Parliament and former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn; Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) member Mustafa Barghouti; and Dearborn, MI mayor Abdullah Hammoud. They appeared as part of a speaker lineup that also included such figures as Sanaâ Daqqa â wife of the late convicted terrorist Walid Daqqa of the U.S.-designated terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) â and PFLP-affiliated former prisoner Wisam Rafeedie.

Rep. Tlaib delivered remarks on the main stage on Saturday afternoon inside a room referred to by organizers as the âWalid Daqqa Ballroomâ â a name indicated both on the published conference schedule and on a large sign bearing his name and photograph outside the room. Tlaib, a Detroit native whose congressional district includes part of the city, told the audience: âYou will always, every single one of you fighting for the liberation of Falasteen, will always be welcome in my city.â

Terrorist and terrorist group connections

Over the course of the weekend, a central feature of the conference was the direct engagement with and veneration of individuals affiliated with U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.

This alignment with terrorism was made clear from the outset, with conference organizers choosing to name the convention center rooms hosting the event in honor of âthe martyrs of our struggle,â as one of the conference MCs highlighted in the opening session. In addition to the above-mentioned âWalid Daqqa Ballroomâ memorializing the late PFLP convicted terrorist, there was a âKhader Adnan Room,â named after the former Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) spokesperson.

On Saturday afternoon, the conference honored Walid Daqqa, his wife Sanaâ, and their daughter Milad. A representative from the U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), on behalf of the conferenceâs Steering Committee, presented Sanaâ Daqqa with a piece of artwork depicting her husband, telling her: âWe hope that you know how much we admire and love your family and honor the legacy of Walidâ¦â

Â 

Sanaâ Daqqa delivered remarks to the crowd, via a translator, denouncing âthe Zionists and their countryâ and claiming that â[Zionists] are the ones who are on the dark side of humanity. They are the human monsters of humanity.â She concluded by stating: âTo you, dear attendees, I say, continue: continue to raise your voice, to fill the streets against and demonstrate against this racist, barbaric Zionist entity. And remember that our resistance is what roots us in our struggle. That we will not capitulate. That it is either victory or death.â

Sanaâ Daqqa spoke again on Sunday, delivering a keynote address titled âThe Palestinian Prisoners' Movement & the Struggle for Liberationâ in which she praised the work of her husband Walid and others who, despite being convicted for terrorism and other charges, continued to participate in the ânational liberation struggle and resistanceâ against Israel. She commented, âwe have to be proud to be part of a people that brings out a prisoner movement like this and brings out heroes and resistance fighters like the ones we have in our prisonersâ movement.â

On Sunday, former PFLP-affiliated prisoner Wisam Rafeedie appeared virtually from the West Bank to speak on the panel âHow Do Movements Achieve Transformationââreceiving a standing ovation from those inside the convention center when he was introduced.

Â 

Speaking via a translator, Rafeedie defended Hamasâ actions on October 7 and downplayed some of the documented atrocities committed that day, commenting that âZionists lie like they breatheâ and disputing the supposed âcheap lies of their propaganda against our people and their resistance. The propaganda that speaks of sexual assaults, of killing children and beheadings.â He denounced âthe Zionist American and Western media that adopted and circulatedâ these alleged âlies.âÂ 

He further stated: âFor 76 years, the Zionists succeeded in portraying themselves as the victim and our people as the victimizers. They exploited the crime of the Nazi massacres to exploit it in their role as our victimizersâ¦They raised antisemitism even in the face of anti-Zionist Jews. They relied on the religious myth of a racist nature, of âGodâs chosen people.â And the same colonial goal of the âpromised landâ that the European white man forwarded in his projects of settler colonialism. All to build up the architecture of their propaganda.â

Garnering cheers of support from the audience, Rafeedie also stated: âThere is no longer a place for the two-state solution for any Palestinian. The only solution is one democratic Palestinian state on all Palestinian land, which will end the Zionist project in Palestine.â

Additional support for terrorism and violence against Israel

Throughout the rest of the weekend, conference organizers and panelists repeatedly expressed their support for violence against Israel and glorified U.S.-designated terror groups and their leaders, often to rousing applause from conference attendees.

Â 

During the Saturday evening plenary titled âZionism and US Imperialism,â Rabab Abdulhadi, a professor at San Francisco State University (SFSU) and the founding director of the universityâs Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas Studies Program (AMED), praised by name PFLP terrorist Mahmoud Al-Aswad. She urged attendees to support the so-called âPalestinian Resistanceâ â including explicitly naming groups like Hamas and PIJ â without reservations or qualifications.Â 

She stated: âIn Palestine, there are many groups â PFLP mostly, but there's also other groups, DFLP and so on â are participating in the Resistance along with Islamic Jihad and Hamas. But it is really mostly the Islamist groups that are leadingâ¦Is it so hard today to support and not to say, âbutâ? [Not to say,] âWe support, but.ââ

Abdulhadi praised these terrorist groups for âcoming togetherâ and defended their actions as âvery measured.â She concluded by proclaiming, âI think we need to be fully supportive with the Resistance and stand by it so we can achieve the victory we will.â

Yara Shoufani, a PYM organizer who delivered the opening keynote and also spoke on a panel later in the weekend, alluded to Hamasâs widespread network of tunnels in Gaza â the same tunnels which have been used to hold many of the hostages taken during the October 7 terrorist attack â when she praised the ability of âthe Resistance in the Gaza Stripâ¦to circumvent the military side or the military leg of imperialism through building tunnels underneath the land.â She also praised the U.S.-designated terror group Ansar Allah (the Houthis) for their actions targeting Israel in the Red Sea.

Shoufani claimed that âthe Palestinian Resistance has demonstrated to our people, to our enemy, and to the entire world, the meaning of dignity, of honor, of resilience, and of glory.â She added: âWe must be relentless in confronting Zionism and committing ourselves fully to the path of Palestinian revolutionâ¦We fight until victory.â

Â 

A plenary session titled âPalestinian Resistance and the Path to Liberationâ featured extensive commentary glorifying terrorism against Israel. Sarah Abdelshamy, a PYM organizer and the sessionâs moderator, said âthe Palestinian Resistance has proven itself to be resourceful, innovative, and most importantly, capable of confronting the enemy on all levels â militarily, politically, ideologically, and existentially.â

Panelist Abdaljawad Omar, a lecturer in the Philosophy and Cultural Studies Department at Birzeit University in the West Bank, said:

âWithout the events of October 7th, regardless of our feelings about those events, the political possibilities we now witness would not exist. The rise of the student movement in the United States and North America and Europe, the demands for divestment and boycott of academic institution [sic], the recognition of the Palestinian state, the moves by the ICC and ICJ, and the significant shifts in global opinion. None of these would have come to passâ¦No single moment has opened so many doors of political possibility.â

He emphasized that âresistance, including armed resistance, inspires â like the inspiration that we take from a bomb that is being placed at the gallows of a high-tech tank.â

Panelist Raja Abdelhaq, co-founder of Palestinian news agency Quds News Network, which has been accused of being affiliated with Hamas and PIJ, spoke about the historical development of the âAxis of Resistanceâ in Palestine and in nearby countries like Iran, Lebanon, and Yemen, praising the âamazingâ collaboration between terror groups like Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and Hezbollah. Abdelhaq criticized so-called âWestern propagandaâ which he said portray this âAxis of Resistanceâ in a negative light and instead glorified those groups involved in âregional resistance movements.â

A PYM speaker identified only by the name Ashraf also praised terror groups and individuals throughout his remarks during the session, including Udai al-Tamimi, a Palestinian terrorist who killed an Israeli soldier at a security checkpoint in 2022. He too lauded Hamasâs intricate tunnel systems in Gaza and the terror groupâs ability to âdevelop weaponryâ and engage in effective âguerilla warfareâ to target Israel.

âGaza has shown us throughout this current war and before the iron strength of the Palestinian Resistance and popular cradle,â he stated, referencing the so-called âAl-Aqsa Floodâ â Hamasâs name for their October 7 attack.

Panelist Tara Alami, an organizer with the Palestinian Feminist Collective, highlighted the actions of terrorist Ibrahim al-Nabulsi, a senior commander in theÂ U.S.-designated terror groupÂ Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades who was involved inÂ several shootings in the West Bank and later died in a firefightÂ with the Israeli military in 2022.

During a plenary session called âEvery Time the Media Lies,â Yumna Patel, the Palestine News Director for the U.S.-based anti-Zionist publication Mondoweiss, spoke about her publicationâs goal to ânormalize resistance,â including explicitly âarmed resistanceâ and âresistance fighters.â Her fellow panelist Layla, a PYM organizer and member of Writers Against the War On Gaza (WAWOG) similarly spoke about her organizationâs efforts âto normalize armed struggleâ in their programming.

During a session on Friday, Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti, secretary general and co-founder of the Palestinian National Initiative and a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), commented that the âAl Aqsa Flood, which came on the seventh of October, actually represented a continuation of a true, new kind of uprising that started in 2015.â

âThe national strategy weâve been talking about all the last years,â he declared, âis the right strategy, is the successful strategy. The strategy that is built on the four pillarsâ¦[Including] the Resistance in all its forms. Resistance is our right, resistance is our way, and resistance is our guarantee to succeed in our future.â

Antisemitic tropes and calls for confrontation with âZionismâ and âZionistsâ globally

At times, rhetoric was infused with language reminiscent of classic antisemitic conspiracy theories, in particular those accusing Jews of having corrupted political institutions. Speakers not only expressed support for violence committed by terrorist groups against Israel, but even potential direct actions targeting âZionistsâ in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Taher Herzallah of American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) shared extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric that echoed age-old antisemitic themes during a plenary session on Friday evening. He stated:

âThe long tentacles of Zionism have always reached deep into the American heartlandâ¦Zionism has penetrated the depths of American society, economics, and politics for decades.â

Herzallah further commented that ânow the gloves are off and quite frankly, anything is possible. I caution you of the days to come, because they will not be easy. There are people among us today who might not be with us next year at this conference. And this is a reality. Because the liberation struggle requires sacrifice. And I know everyone here is prepared to make that sacrifice.â

Iman Abid, director of organizing and advocacy at the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR) and the regional director of the Genesee Valley Chapter of the NYCLU, moderated the Sunday plenary titled âUncommitted Votes: Fracturing of the Two Party System,â where she alleged that âthe pro-Israel lobbying firm has entrenched itself into every facet of U.S. politics.â

Monadel Herzallah, founder and President of the Arab American Union Members Council and an organizer with USPCN and Labor For Palestine, alleged during a plenary on Saturday that âthe Zionist movement came with a purpose. They are â they want to be â in control of all resources, you know. Congress, senators and everything like that.â He concluded that âas we are witnessing, the Zionism [sic] is digging their own grave. We are going to help bury that thing.â

Sara Kershnar, co-founder of the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network (IJAN), spoke at length about her organizationâs goal to âdismantle Zionismâ and stated in no uncertain terms her support for âarmed resistanceâ during the âZionism and US Imperialismâ plenary. âIt is crucial to the future of humanity and the very survival of the planet that we dismantle Zionism,â Kershnar stated.

Kershnar further opined that âwe have to keep decentering the conversation of Jewish safetyâ and claimed that âZionism is really the most antisemitic movement.â She further alleged that âfor the Zionists, for the U.S. and its allies, it has never had anything to do with Jewish safety, has never had anything to do with valuing Jewish lifeâ and expressed her hope that âIsrael is going to fall.â

Speaking along Wisam Rafeedie on the âHow do Movements Achieve Transformation?â plenary,Â Vijay Prashad, Executive Director of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research, proclaimed thatÂ âthe Israeli Zionist project is finished. Itâs over. It has lost ideologically. Now, it will lose institutionally.â

Who were the groups officially promoting these messages?

The âPeopleâs Conference for Palestineâ was troubling not only for the extreme rhetoric that was embraced, but also the clear message it sent indicating that these extreme positions are accepted by nearly all of the major players in the anti-Zionist movement. Equally, if not even more concerning, over the past eight months, these same groups have largely been accepted by many in the mainstream for their leading role in organizing popular anti-Israel protests and encampments, providing guidance on authoring and advancing divestment resolutions, and other activities.Â

Â 

The fifteen convening organizations that served as the steering committee for the conference make up much of the backbone of the anti-Israel activist movement in the U.S. and included the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), National Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), The Peopleâs Forum, Al-Awda: The Palestine Right to Return Coalition, Palestinian Feminist Collective, ANSWER Coalition, U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR), Arab Resource and Organizing Center (AROC), International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network (IJAN), Writers Against the War on Gaza (WAWOG), National Alliance Against Racist & Political Repression (NAARPR), and others.

The conference was endorsed by more than 300 additional organizations â from anti-Zionist activist groups, to leftist political groups, to religious organizations, to university-affiliated programs.

Endorsers included Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), Samidoun, WESPAC Foundation, Code Pink, Dissenters, Friends of Sabeel North America (FOSNA), Jisoor, MPower Change, National Lawyers Guild (NLG), Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas Studies Program (AMED) at San Francisco State University (SFSU), and Department of African American Studies at Wayne State University (WSU).

Organizers solicited donations for the conference via the Palestinian Youth Movement and WESPAC.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-calls-meta-shareholders-protect-kids-antisemitism-and-cyberbullying,"New York, NY, May 28, 2024â¦ ADL (Anti-Defamation League) and JLens filed aÂ Notice of Exempt Solicitation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, calling on shareholders to vote in favor ofÂ Proposal Eleven in Meta's 2024 proxy statement. The proposal would require Meta to transparently address critical issues of hate speech and cyberbullying as well as other issues related to protecting kids.

According to aÂ 2023 survey conducted by theÂ ADL Center for Technology & Society (âCTSâ), online hate and harassment remain persistent and entrenched problems on social media platforms. The CTS survey revealed that 51 percent of teens ages 13 to 17 reported experiencing online harassment. Of those teens, more than half experienced that harassment on Facebook, more than any other platform, and 48 percent reported experiencing harassment on Instagram. For 47 percent of teens, online harassment also led to in person and offline harassment.

âAs the world's largest social media company, with billions of users across its Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms, Meta has an urgent responsibility to protect kids,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âThe implementation of Proposal Eleven would represent a significant and much-needed advancement from Meta's current policies and practices, demonstrating a commitment to combating antisemitism and online hate.â

The 2023 survey also revealed increased reports of hate and harassment across nearly all demographic groups compared to 2022. Moreover, Jewish respondents were 80 percent more likely to worry about harassment while 25 percent avoided identifying as Jewish online.

âThe unprecedented surge of antisemitism and hate online is increasingly translating into physical confrontations and violence, endangering the most vulnerable members of our communities,â said JLens Managing Director Ari Hoffnung. âA vote for Proposal Eleven will help ensure that Meta is held accountable for its child safety efforts.â

In ADLâsÂ recent report, researchers simulated algorithmic recommendations using various personas. The findings revealed that on Instagram, the most virulent and hateful antisemitic content was pushed to accounts indicating they were 14 years old. These accounts promoted, among other things, Nazi propaganda, Holocaust denial, and white supremacist symbols. This underscores the platformâs role in amplifying hate and highlights the need for better policies to protect young users.

The 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Meta Platforms, Inc. is scheduled to be held on May 29, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Meta shareholders who have not yet voted are encouraged to refer to their proxy materials or contact their bank or broker to ensure their voice is heard.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-ajhs-partner-preserve-historical-legacy-fighting-antisemitism,"New York, NY, May 28, 2024 â¦ As the U.S. celebrates Jewish American Heritage Month, the American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS) and ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced a new partnership to preserve the institutional archives that document ADLâs fight against antisemitism, hate and bigotry since its founding in 1913.

The ADL Archives Project will catalog, stabilize and digitize ADLâs collections to preserve and provide public access to important archival materials documenting ADLâs work and research. The collaboration with AJHS will safeguard more than 13,000 boxes of documents, microfilms, audiovisual recordings and photographs â a comprehensive record of hate and bigotry in the United States and ADLâs ongoing efforts to combat them.

âWith antisemitic incidents and attitudes at historic levels, itâs imperative that we preserve these invaluable records of our fight against hate for future generations,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âThis partnership with AJHS not only ensures the preservation of a critical part of Jewish and American history, but also strengthens our collective resolve to combat antisemitism and all forms of bigotry.â

At present, many of the materials remain uncatalogued and inaccessible to researchers, and many fragile items must be stabilized before they are lost. The partnership will be partially funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the philanthropist Sid Lapidus.

âPartnering with ADL allows us to safeguard unique perspectives on the evolving nature of extremism and peerless insights gathered from the frontlines of fighting hate for over a century,â said Gemma Birnbaum, Executive Director of AJHS. âWe are committed to preserving this history to ground the foundation for combating hate for generations to come.â

As part of the new partnership, ADL and AJHS recently curated an exhibition during the 2024 Never Is Now Summit in New York City, sharing highlights of ADLâs work decade by decade and contextualized by documents and multimedia from its extensive archives â from countering Henry Fordâs antisemitism in the 1920s to confronting increased antisemitism on college campuses today.

The preservation of ADLâs history of fighting antisemitism comes as antisemitic incidents in the U.S. have reached record levels. In January, ADL releasedÂ preliminary dataÂ finding a total of 3,291 antisemitic incidents between Oct. 7 and Jan. 7, a 361-percent increase over the year prior, putting 2023 on track to be the worst year since ADL started tracking this data in the late 1970s. Recently, an ADLÂ surveyÂ revealed anti-Jewish attitudes are at an all-time high, with 24-percent of Americans harboring extensive antisemitic prejudice, up from 20 percent in 2022.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/support-october-7-attack-glorification-terror-mark-2024-nakba-day-events,"Nakba Day commemorations across the United States, already charged events, were compounded this year by a sharp rise in anti-Israel activity tied to the Israel-Hamas war that was triggered by the October 7 mass terror attacks.Â Nakba Day (âcatastropheâ in Arabic) is commemorated annually on May 15 by Palestinians and their supporters worldwide to mourn the events related to theÂ creation of the State of Israel, including its impact on Palestinians, and to advocate for theÂ Right of Return for Palestinian refugees.

Historically, Nakba Day events in the U.S. haveÂ frequently been marked by antisemitic and inflammatory language. More than fifty Nakba Day events took place nationwide this year from May 11 to May 19, 2024, in person at protests and rallies and online via webinars, teach-ins and other gatherings. As in past years, this yearâs Nakba Day events again featured support for terrorism and violence against Israel, extreme anti-Zionism and significant antisemitism.

Notable trends at this yearâs Nakba Day events included theÂ glorification of prominent terrorists and terrorist group leaders âÂ Â  among them figures who were directly involved in Hamasâs October 7 terrorist attack on Israel. Protesters and speakers at Nakba Day 2024 events endorsed Hamasâs actions as âjustified,â while outrightlyÂ dismissing reports of rape and systemic sexual assault suffered by Israeli women at the hands of Hamas-led terrorists during the unprecedented assault. Other common rhetoric included the demonization ofÂ Zionism and Zionists, including by making comparisons to Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan, and by invokingÂ classic antisemitic tropes about supposed outsized Jewish power and influence.",,,

ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today condemned the U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice, for allowing external political pressureÂ to dictate its biased ruling demanding Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah.

ADL issued the following statement:

ADL condemns the ICJ for allowing external political pressureÂ to dictate its biased ruling today, and South Africa for essentially serving as Hamasâ representatives at the court. By demanding that Israel immediately halt its military operation in Rafah, the ICJ has determined that Israel has no right to retrieve its hostages or defend its citizens from terror.

The very fact that Hamas, the terrorist organization that perpetrated the October 7 massacre, congratulated the ICJ on this ruling attests to the absurdity of these proceedings. We call on members of the internationalÂ community to reject the ICJâs-biased ruling.

ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today reiterated its call for Northwestern University President Michael Schill to resign following his troubling testimony before Congress that was ârife with hypocrisy and platitudes.âÂ Â 

David Goldenberg, ADL Midwest Regional Director, issued the following statement:

""President Schillâs testimony today clarified his leadership imperils Jewish students and that he has failed at virtually every turn to take antisemitism on Northwestern Universityâs campus seriously.Â  ADL Midwest renews its call for his immediate resignation.Â 

""President Schill admitted in his opening statement that he was aware of the spike of antisemitism on campus before the encampment went up on April 25. He said he knew the encampment violated existing University rules and that encampment protestors engaged in antisemitism, including threats of violence against Jewish students. Yet he did nothing.

""President Schill testified the Deering Agreement was reached at 4am without sufficient consultation with Jewish students or leaders on campus because it was âimpractical.â Yet he somehow had time to consult select members of the Board of Trustees, but not the whole Board, and with select members of the Advisory Committee on Preventing Antisemitism and Hate, including Jessica Winegar, a leading international proponent of the BDS movement. In other words, he only asked those he knew would not push back against his capitulation to rule breakers and the obvious dangers the agreement posed to the future of Jewish students on campus.""

President Schillâs testimony was rife with hypocrisy and platitudes.Â  We learned:

He amended Northwesternâs codes of conduct specifically to address the encampment and admitted the encampment and antisemitism stemming from it were clear violations of University rules, yet he allowed the encampment to remain and refused to say if or when violators, including academic faculty, will be held accountable.Â 
Â 
He admitted he only appointed one expert on antisemitism to his Advisory Committee on Preventing Antisemitism and acted surprised it could not reach consensus on the definition of antisemitism.Â  Now, he asks for the opportunity to form a task force to address antisemitism after failing so spectacularly the first time.
Â 
He gloated about and took credit for a âpeacefulâ end to the encampment.Â  Yet he allowed the encampment to remain and rewarded the protestorsâ escalation.Â  All the while, he refused to take other common-sense measures to keep non-students out of the encampment, stop academic faculty from cancelling or relocating class to the encampment, remove antisemitic posters and flags from university fencing, and eliminate amplified sound â all apparent violations of Northwesternâs existing rules.
Â 
And President Schill claimed during testimony that he still does not know who was behind the encampment, yet he somehow reached an agreement with encampment leaders.

""President Schillâs retention in the face of these failures is likely to keep Jewish students in harmâs way and impede any possibility of meaningful dialogue on campus,"" said Goldenberg.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/federal-complaint-filed-against-pomona-occidental-colleges-severe,"Washington, D.C., May 9, 2024:Â The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under LawÂ and ADL (theÂ Anti-Defamation League)Â today announced they have filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights against two California colleges -- Occidental and Pomona -- for permitting severe discrimination and harassment of Jewish students in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Â Arnold & Porter joined the Brandeis Center and ADL in the filing against Pomona College.

Since 10/7, Jewish and Israeli students on both campuses have been verbally harassed and physically surrounded, followed, threatened, and intimidated by protestors.Â They have been shouted at, told to âgo back to the gas chambers,â and called âkike,â âf**king Jew,â âf**king Zionist,â and âmurderer.âÂ  Many have been obstructed from moving freely about campus and cannot carry out their jobs or partake in educational opportunities as a result of antisemitic bullying, and some have even been physically assaulted. Many Jewish students confine themselves to their dorm rooms orÂ refrain from participating in certain educational and/or extracurricular activities, avoiding certain dining halls or cafÃ©s, common areas on campus, and campus eventsÂ to avoid anti-Semitic harassment. Several have transferred to other schools due to persistent antisemitism.Â 

âJewish students on these campuses are hiding in their dorms and avoiding their own campus rather than risk verbal and physical attacks,â stated Kenneth L. Marcus, founder and chairman of the Brandeis Center and the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights.Â  âPomona and Occidental know full well this is happening.Â  But instead of enforcing the law and their own policies, they are caving to the anti-Semitic mob and letting them bully, harass, and intimidate Jewish students.Â  Antisemitism left unaddressed will not go away.Â  It will only snowball and escalate until the problem is faced head on as the law requires.â

âThereâs simply no excuse for the persistent and pervasive antisemitic harassment being faced by Jewish students at Occidental and Pomona colleges,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âNo student should be forced to transfer due to continual harassment. We urge the U.S. Department of Education to investigate these schools for potential civil rights violations and to take effective measures to protect Jewish students on these campuses.â

Occidental College

Occidental is fully aware of the pervasive and hostile environment for Jewish students, and has ignored and enabled it.

The complaint details how Jewish students were forced out of school-sponsored employment opportunities due to severe and pervasive antisemitic environments.Â  Many Jewish students chose to leave their jobs rather than continue to subject themselves to antisemitic attacks, Holocaust inversion, and harassment while others chose to take unsafe routes home rather than continue to be harassed.

At every turn, Occidental has put its Jewish students last, swiftly enforcing policies against its Jewish students while continuing to ignore the same or similar violations from the anti-Israel and antisemitic crowd. Jewish students are harassed and obstructed daily on campus, in their dorms, in the dining hall, and more. One particularly egregious incident occurred when antisemitic protests occupied and vandalized the central administrative building for nearly a week. Despite several warnings to the trespassing students and staff, Occidental forwent enforcing school policies and instead capitulated to the occupiersâ demands. Occidental sent a clear message â when the victims of violations are Jewish, the rules will not be enforced.

Faculty at Occidental have also played a role in encouraging the antisemitic environment.Â One professor told her students she felt âinvigoratedâ by the Hamas terrorist attack and encouraged students to share her excitement.Â  Others have participated in pro-Hamas chanting and made antisemitic statements. More than 60 faculty members sent an email denying that Hamasâ actions were terrorism.Â  The school has said nothing to condemn these antisemitic declarations, sending a green light to students that this behavior is permitted.

Pomona College

The already hostile environment for Jewish students at Pomona took a turn for the worse immediately following the October 7 terrorist attack with various student groups and members of the faculty loudly supporting the murderous Hamas attacks, blaming the Israeli victims, and creating a shrine honoring the Hamas terrorists. Pomona students blocked access to buildings, interfered with classes and school events, and harassed current and prospective students.Â  At first, the Pomona administration did very little to remedy the hostile environment. But as the situation deteriorated, President G. Gabrielle Starr eventually began to respond.Â  But despite her laudable, albeit belated efforts to address growing antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, Pomona failed to eliminate the hostile environment, in part, because the opposition from pro-Hamas students and faculty had already grown too strong.

Multiple incidents of physical violence and intimidation occurred during the numerous explicitly pro-Hamas protests that took place at Pomona.Â  For example, during one demonstration, protestors surrounded Jewish students who were putting up posters of hostages, physically preventing them from hanging the posters.Â  The protestors then followed the Jewish students and a Jewish adult staff member, obstructed their paths, verbally harassed them, and tore up at least 300 of the Jewish studentsâ pre-approved flyers.Â  Later that day a protestor saw one of the Jewish students and aggressively pushed him into a wall. The Jewish student was then tailed by other protestors who threatened and intimidated him. The school has taken no action and school security has even refused to watch security footage of the protest incident. Most Jewish students sheltered in in their dorms or left campus entirely for their safety, missing classes to avoid the physically hostile demonstrators.

Another protest was so disruptive, including loud antisemitic chants and the blocking of entrances, forcing President Starr to cancel her Family Weekend Address. During another protest, when a student tried to move past the demonstrators to attend the Harry Potter Dinner, an annual Pomona tradition, the demonstrators blocked and grabbed him. Protestors have also disrupted and harassed prospective student tours to such a degree that one prospective student started sobbing. The message was clear: Jewish families and Jewish students are not welcome at Pomona.Â  During a recent protest, President Starr had to call the police to protect herself and the Pomona community at large, resulting in nineteen arrests for criminal trespass and obstruction of justice. This conduct has ensued despite President Starrâs warnings to the Pomona community, her attempts to impose order on campus, and her efforts to offer support to the victimized Jewish and Israeli students.

""I have seen antisemitism here grow tremendously in the last 3 years,â stated Pomona student, Ayelet Kleinerman. ""I have raised it with the administration many times, but even when they had the opportunity to take it seriously, they didn't. Theyâve called the police for their own safety, but they are not doing enough to protect Jewish students.Â  From hate speech to retaliation in class and outside it to the mob that is occupying our campus and has taken over much of campus life, Jewish students are scared.""

Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination against Jews on the basis of their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding.Â  Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful.Â  UNESCO has cautioned that âJewâ and âZionistâ are often used interchangeably today in an attempt by antisemites to cloak their hate.Â  According to President Bidenâs U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, released in May 2023, âJewish students and educators are targeted for derision and exclusion on college campuses, often because of their real or perceived views about the State of Israel.Â  When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or their identity, when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism. And that is unacceptable.â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-partners-common-sense-media-film-lists-celebrating-jewish-experience,"Los Angeles, CA, May 8, 2024 â In honor of Jewish American Heritage Month, the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Media & Entertainment Institute today announced the release of two curated film lists developed in partnership with Common Sense Media: ""Movies That Illustrate and Celebrate the Jewish Experience"" and ""Movies About the Holocaust."" The initiative aims to promote understanding, appreciation, and diversity through cinema that reflects the rich tapestry of Jewish life and the profound human narratives of the Holocaust.

Coming at a time when antisemitic incidents have reached historic levels in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, these film lists serve as crucial educational tools for those curious about Jews and the Jewish world. They showcase films that aim to combat stereotypes and foster empathy through a wide range of Jewish characters and stories.

This collaboration stems from the ADL Media & Entertainment Institute's ongoing efforts to ensure nuanced, authentic, and diverse representations of Jewish stories and characters in media. Common Sense Mediaâs original Jewish film list, ""Movies That Illustrate and Celebrate the Jewish Experience"" now features 31 titles, while the ""Movies About the Holocaust"" list includes 14 titles, with plans to add more in the coming months.

âAs we face an alarming increase in antisemitic incidents, itâs more crucial than ever to harness the power of film to educate and inspire,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âWe encourage storytellers, educators, and all content creators to join us by expanding on the many beautiful, dramatic, funny, and ultimately human narratives in these collections. By doing so, we will illuminate the richness and resilience of the Jewish community, building empathy and understanding.â

âThis collaboration with ADLâs Media & Entertainment Institute ensures that Common Sense Mediaâs lists encapsulate a wide range of Jewish experiences, so that our resources can help foster understanding and combat stereotypes across diverse audiences,â said Li Lai, Senior Director of Content at Common Sense Media.

Curating a World of Jewish Stories


The selection process for the lists was meticulous, with a focus on films that:

Illustrate the great variety of Jewish backgrounds and historical experience via every genre of film, from animated classics to profound dramas.

Feature Jewish narratives as central to their plots and avoid perpetuating negative Jewish stereotypes or antisemitic tropes.

Depict the unique historical and moral significance of the Holocaust.

These films are more than entertainment: they are a gateway to understanding the complexities of Jewish life and history. For Jewish individuals, they are mirrors reflecting lived experience, and for others they are windows framing the rich vibrancy of Jewish culture.

""This is just the start of our effort to compile and share films showcasing the incredible range of experience of the Jewish people, and we will be building out these lists further in the coming months,â said Deborah Camiel, Director of the ADL Media & Entertainment Institute. âOur partnership with Common Sense Media is powerful because of their vast reach and trusted reputation among parents. Through this collaboration, we aim to share a wide range of Jewish stories that are both engaging and eye-opening.""

A Call to Action for Continued Storytelling

ADL and Common Sense Media invite everyone, from families to film enthusiasts, to explore these lists. Viewers are encouraged to share these films and engage in discussions about the Jewish experience and broader themes of difference and tolerance.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/iss-joins-adl-recommending-against-anti-israel-shareholder-proposal-amazons,"New York, NY, May 9, 2024â¦Â ADL (Anti-Defamation League)Â applauds the decision by Institutional Shareholder Services (âISSâ), a leading independent proxy advisory firm, to recommend investors vote against an anti-Israel shareholder proposal inÂ Amazon's 2024 proxy statement.

Titled âCustomer Due Diligence,âÂ Shareholder Proposal 6 seeks to end the company's involvement in Project Nimbusâa $1.2 billion cloud computing agreement with the Israeli government. This threatens to unjustly deprive Israel's essential social services and the Israel Defense Forces of crucial technologies.

While Proposal 6 ostensibly aims to uphold human rights, it singles out Israel as the sole foreign country and is supported by multiple false statements alleging that the Israeli government uses Amazon Web Services âto support the apartheid system under which Palestinians are surveilled, unlawfully detained, and tortured.â

âTheÂ accusations made against Israel are a fundamental distortion of what this country stands for, in particular equal treatment of all citizens,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âAmazon shareholders must reject the anti-Israel rhetoric of theÂ Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement by voting against Proposal 6.â

On April 12th, ADL and JLens filed aÂ Notice of Exempt Solicitation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, opposing Proposal 6. The notice was submitted because Proposal 6 contains language that was false and misleading, could embolden antisemitism in society, and seeks to delegitimize Israelâs right to exist.

âHate speech does not belong in corporate proxy statements,â said JLens Managing Director Ari Hoffnung. âWords matter and we urge shareholders to reject the hateful, false and misleading rhetoric seeking to delegitimize Israelâs right to exist by voting against Proposal 6.â

According toÂ research published by the Stanford Graduate School of Business, ISS and Glass Lewis are the largest proxy advisory firms globally in terms of the number of corporate issuers covered, proxy voting recommendations provided, and the number and size of institutional investors served.

Amazonâs Board of Directors has recommended voting against Proposal 6. The companyâs Annual Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled to be held at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. Amazon shareholders who have not yet voted are encouraged to refer to their proxy materials or contact their bank or broker to ensure their voice is heard.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/us-department-education-opens-investigation-anti-semitism-berkeley-k-12,"Washington, D.C., May 7, 2024:Â The U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced today it has opened a formal investigation into aÂ complaint that the Berkeley Unified School District (BUSD) failed to address non-stop âsevere and persistentâ bullying and harassment of Jewish students in classrooms, hallways, schools yards, and walkouts since October 7, 2023.

BUSD Superintendent Enikia Ford Morthel is also being called to testify tomorrow before the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce about BUSDâs anti-Semitism problem. This is the Committeeâs first K-12 hearing on anti-Semitism.Â  It has held two hearings on college anti-Semitism where Committee members questioned the heads of Harvard, MIT, the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination against Jews based on their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding. Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful. UNESCO has cautioned that âJewâ and âZionistâ are often used interchangeably today in an attempt by anti-Semites to cloak their hate. President Bidenâs US National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, released in May 2023, observed that âWhen Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or their identity, when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism. And that is unacceptable.â

The Title VI complaint being investigated by the Department of Education was filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under LawÂ and ADL (theÂ Anti-Defamation League), and it documentsÂ dozens of incidents such as students shouting âf--- the Jewsâ and âKKK,â graffiti stating âKill Jews,â and teachers indoctrinating students with anti-Semitic tropes and biased, one-sided anti-Israel propaganda disguised as education.Â  BUSD has not only failed to address the cascading anti-Semitism, according to the complaint, it has permitted retaliation against parents who complained.

The organizations first filed theÂ complaint in February calling on the Department of Education to intervene.Â  They documented numerous incidents includingÂ anti-Semitic comments, such as âkill the Jews,â non-Jewish students asking Jewish students what âtheir number is,â referring to numbers tattooed on Jews during the Holocaust, Jewish students being told âI donât like your peopleâ and being derided for their physical appearance, and Jewish students being blamed and demonized. The complaint also documented how students have had to endure anti-Semitic teacher rants and class activities and teacher-promoted âwalkoutsâ that praise Hamas.Â  In fact,Â during an unauthorized teacher-promoted walkout for Palestine, no teachers intervened as students shouted, âKill the Jews,â âKKK,â âKill Israel,â and âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.â

Yesterday, the organizationsÂ expanded the complaint, advising OCR that in the last three months, anti-Jewish bigotry and harassment has only escalated and the environment has become even more hostile and threatening. Some of the new incidents described in the expanded complaint include, âKill Jewsâ scrawled at Berkeley High School, âKill all Zionistsâ written at the bus stop used by many Berkeley High School students to get to and from school, children on the playground saying âJews are stupid,â a ninth-grader bullied after his parent reported anti-Semitic incidents, teachers continuing to teach one-sided anti-Israel propaganda disguised as education, and removal of posters condemning anti-Semitism and supporting Israelâs right to exist, while anti-Israel and pro-Hamas posters remain undisturbed.

Parents have repeatedly reported anti-Semitic incidents to the administration, but BUSD has done nothing to address, much less curtail, the hostile environment that has plagued BUSD since October 7, and is continuing to pick up steam. Instead of addressing teachersâ anti-Semitic behavior, BUSD officials have chosen to disrupt the Jewish studentsâ learning by moving them into new classes, further ostracizing and marginalizing them from their peers and normalizing anti-Semitic behavior.

Jewish students report being worried about mob violence, including being âjumpedâ at school. Many have said they remove their Stars of David and no longer wear Jewish camp t-shirts, and that they are learning to keep their heads down, hide their Judaism and move through their school days in fear. Some students have left the district due to the pervasive bullying.

âBerkeley would never sit idly by and allow vicious threats, harassment, and intimidation of any other minority group, yet when it comes to Jews, seven months of crickets. Â Making matters even worse, they are permitting teachers, their employees, to indoctrinate students with lesson plans chock full of anti-Semitic tropes and anti-Israel propaganda,â stated Kenneth L. Marcus, founder and chairman of the Brandeis Center and the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights for George W. Bush and Donald Trump.Â  âReprehensible is an understatement here. Â It is high time BUSD enforces federal and state law to address the dangerous anti-Semitism snowballing in front of them.â

âWe believe there's a disturbing and clear pattern of anti-Semitic intimidation and harassment in the Berkeley school system, and we are pleased the Office of Civil Rights has opened a formal civil rights investigation,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âJewish grade school students -- like all students -- deserve the ability to attend school in a climate free of prejudice, threats or bias.â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-launches-holocaust-awareness-campaign-featuring-prominent-tiktok,"TikTok videos will share testimonials, educate against denial & raise awarenessÂ 

Â 
New York, NY, May 6, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today launched a new social media campaign geared toward Gen Z consumers of social media. The campaign, with an emphasis on TikTok and other video platforms, will highlight and promote survivor testimonials and messages from several TikTok creators, with an aim to counter Holocaust denial and misinformation.Â 

Â 

The new ADL campaign is being timed to Holocaust Remembrance Day, May 5-6, and scheduled to run throughout the month of May, which is Jewish American Heritage Month. Prominent TikTok creators recruited for the effort include Ellie Zeiler, Eitan Bernath, Montana Tucker, Carly Weinstein, and Tova and Aron Friedman.Â 

Â 

A report issued last year by ADL found that social media and online game platforms are failing to effectively moderate and remove Holocaust denial content from their platforms, with no platform scoring higher than a âC+.â Recent surveys have shown that many Americans lack basic facts about the Holocaust. Holocaust denial is an antisemitic conspiracy theory claiming that Jews fabricated evidence of their own genocide for political, personal and financial gain.Â 

Â 

âAt a time when denial is rising and general knowledge about the events of the Holocaust is diminishing, particularly among young people, thereâs a need to reach this demographic with video testimonials and factual information about the murder of the six million,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âAn important focus will be on misinformation: Our creators will help young people to learn how to spot the lies, spread facts, and not repeat or share things about the Holocaust that are false.âÂ 

Â 

With the theme of âSpot Lies. Spread Facts,â the campaign is further supported with educational materials from Echoes & Reflections, a multimedia educational curriculum created by ADL, the USC Shoah Foundation and Yad Vashem. The influencer campaign is part of a larger, ongoing effort to raise awareness and understanding of the Holocaust among young people in America by targeting teachers to add student activities into their curriculum and bringing these lessons directly to teens, meeting them where they are online.Â Â 

Â 

âI saw the shootings, hangings, gassing and burnings. This is undeniable evidence of the atrocities that I witnessed in Auschwitz,â Holocaust survivor Tova Freidman states in her TikTok video, as she rolls up her sleeve to reveal her tattooed identification number. âAnd they say to my face that it never happened. This misinformation is unbearable, and the Holocaust wasnât that long ago. Help us fight the spread of misinformation. The more you know, the stronger you are.âÂ 

Â 

ADL also is supporting efforts to pass legislation at both the state and federal level that would ensure the Holocaust is taught consistently and appropriately in schools. ADL strongly advocated for the Never Again Education Act, which passed in 2020 and provides federal funding for U.S. educators to teach about the Holocaust in their classrooms. ADL is now urging bipartisan and bicameral support for the Never Again Education Reauthorization Act, the Holocaust Education and Antisemitism Lessons (HEAL) Act, and the Countering Antisemitism Act (CAA), to ensure students are accurately taught about the Holocaust.Â 

Â 

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms ofâ¯antisemitism andâ¯bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/snowballing-antisemitism-prompts-brandeis-center-and-adl-expand-civil,"Washington, D.C., May 6, 2024 ... The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under LawÂ and ADL (the Anti-Defamation League)Â today expanded their complaintÂ against the Berkeley Unified School District (BUSD), sounding the alarm that the already-hostile environment for Jewish students is taking a frightening turn for the worse.

In February, the two organizations filed aÂ complaint with the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights (OCR) against the Berkeley school district for failing to take action to end the nonstop bullying and harassment of Jewish students by peers and teachers. Incidents included calls to âkill the Jewsâ and âeliminate Israelâ and Jewish students being asked what âtheir number is,â referring to Nazi concentration camps, derided for their physical appearance, or told âI donât like your peopleâ and âOf course it was the Jews.â During an unauthorized teacher-promoted walkout for Palestine, no teachers intervened as students shouted, âKill the Jews,â âKKK,â âKill Israel,â and âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.â

The complaint documented how BUSD teachers are weaponizing disciplines such as art and history to promote anti-Semitic tropes about Israel. At Berkeley High School, a history teacher screened an anti-Zionist video and forced students to analyze Israel as an apartheid state. This teacher sharply squelched dissent, stating that materials which oppose the apartheid narrative are âlaughable.â A high school art teacher showed students violent pro-Hamas videos and displayed anti-Israel and anti-Semitic images during class, including a fist punching through a Star of David. Indoctrination attempts occur in classes for young children. In one second-grade classroom, a teacher hung a Palestinian flag in the window and encouraged students to write âStop Bombing Babiesâ on sticky notes to be posted next to the classroom of the only Jewish teacher.

At the time, Jewish students reported being worried about mob violence, including being âjumpedâ at school. Many said they removed their Stars of David and no longer wear Jewish camp t-shirts, and that they were learning to keep their heads down, hide their Judaism and move through their school days in fear. Some students left the district due to this pervasive bullying.

After three additional months of silence and inaction from Berkeley authorities, according to the Brandeis Center and ADL, the environment has become even more hostile and threatening.Â  For example, since the original complaint was filed:

âKill Jewsâ was scrawled in a Berkeley High School bathroom. BUSD did not issue a statement denouncing Jew hatred or expressing a zero-tolerance policy for threats of violence against Jewish members of the school community.
âKill all Zionistsâ was written at the bus stop used by many Berkeley High School students to get to and from school; the hateful vandalism remained for days after it was reported. Again, BUSD made no statement denouncing the violent and threatening rhetoric against the Jewish and Israeli members of the school community.
A first-grader heard older children on the playground saying âJews are stupid.â The six-year-old told his mother that he wishes he were not Jewish because people do not like Jews. Since the incident, he has not wanted to go to school. Instead of intervening, the school principal suggested the six-year-old speak with the older bullies to resolve the problem.
A ninth-grader faced bullying and taunting after his parent reported anti-Semitic incidents. On a public and widely circulated social media post, an upper-level high school student targeted the Jewish ninth-grader, calling him a âdumbassâ who is âblatantly lying cuz he loves genocide that much.â This message was then re-posted by other students and received countless views. BUSD took no discernable action in response.
The art teacher who created a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students was finally put on leave after dozens of major media outlets, including CNN, reported on the anti-Semitism in his classroom. Since then, posters have appeared tacked on walls all over the high school building with an image of the teacher and the caption âBring Mr. ____ Back.â Instead of addressing the inappropriate posters, the principal sent âshoutoutsâ to all students and faculty, praising the teacher.
During a cooking lesson on Palestinian food, a seventh-grade teacher forced her students to listen to a podcast that demonized Israel and the Jews, included false information, and presented a libelous narrative about Israelis âstealingâ land, appropriating recipes, and engaging in âethnic cleansing of Palestinians.â This type of propaganda not only demonizes and damages the Jewish and Israeli students in the class, it instills a hatred of Israel and Jews into all students, perpetuating the cycle of anti-Semitic hostility throughout the District. When parents complained, the school failed to respond.
In March, a high school teacher posted political propaganda in her classroom including a QR code for a Gaza Genocide Action Toolkit that accuses Israel of genocide, tells readers to support the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, which seeks the elimination of Israel, to âmake sure everyone knows that Israel is mass murdering Palestinian families with our tax dollars,â and to tell Congress âthey have blood on their hands.â It also characterizes the ADL as ""a right-wing organization that uses inflammatory, racist rhetoric to mislead the public, cover up Israelâs war crimes, and smear activists for Palestinian rights.â
Ethnic Studies teachers began presenting unapproved, biased, and anti-Semitic propaganda in the classroom that further marginalizes Jewish and Israeli students.Â  A vocabulary list given to students defines âAnti-Zionistâ as a person who âbelieve[s] in a future where all people on the land live in freedom, safety and equality;â Hamas as an âIslamic Resistance Movement;â and Hamasâ brutal acts of terror as âarmed resistance.â The list includes terms like âapartheid,â âethnic cleansing,â âoccupation,â and âsettler colonialism,â which are commonly used to demonize Israel.
A group of BUSD teachers wrote an inflammatory and divisive letter to the school board after the Brandeis Center/ADL complaint was filed, characterizing parents who reported incidents of anti-Semitism at BUSD as âextremeâ community members and âoppressors,â and labeling their efforts to protect their children as âpart of the Zionist playbook.âÂ  Â They also asserted that â[t]he ADL is known as âIsraelâs attack dogsâ in the US.â
A âBUSD for a Ceasefire in Palestineâ walkout, promoted by teachers, took place during school hours at Berkeley High School. School resources and facilities were used to organize the walkout and staff attended along with students.
While posters displaying anti-Israel propaganda and promoting anti-Semitism are left untouched, posters condemning anti-Semitism and supporting Israelâs right to exist are ripped down from the hallways of Berkeley High School without investigation or consequences.

âDereliction of duty doesnât even come close to describing what we are seeing in Berkeley; it is disgusting and shameful,â stated Kenneth L. Marcus, founder and chairman of the Brandeis Center and the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights for the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations. âThe Berkeley Superintendent and the School Board are either completely incompetent or they are willfully ignoring their job. If even one of these incidents was happening to any other minority group it would be promptly addressed, withÂ consequences, not ignored and permitted to snowball out of control when it comes to the safety of Jewish students.â

âThe blatant disregard by BUSD of this continuing anti-Semitic harassment, bullying and rhetoric is inexcusable,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âJewish students are hiding their identities and are afraid to go to school â this is outrageous, unacceptable, and should not be happening in 2024. The Berkeley School District must be held accountable for their inaction and seeming indifference to addressing this hostile school environment and must do more to ensure the safety of Jewish students.â

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin, including discrimination against Jews on the basis of their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding.Â  Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful. UNESCO has cautioned that âJewâ and âZionistâ are often used interchangeably today in an attempt by anti-Semites to cloak their hate. President Bidenâs U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, released in May 2023, observed that âJewish students and educators are targeted for derision and exclusion on college campuses, often because of their real or perceived views about the State of Israel.Â When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or their identity, when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism. And that is unacceptable.â

May marks Jewish American Heritage Month, a time to reflect on and celebrate the multifaceted nature of Jewish communities around the world. ADLâs Media & Entertainment Institute is thrilled to announce two vital resources developed in collaboration with Common Sense Media: ""Movies That Illustrate and Celebrate the Jewish Experience"" and ""Movies About the Holocaust."" These curated collections of films are part of our ongoing effort to ensure that the vibrance and variety of Jewish life and experience are accurately represented in media and entertainment.

Mass media significantly influences public perceptions, particularly of minority communities. With Jews comprising just 2.4% of the U.S. population and about one-third of Americans reporting no personal acquaintances with Jewish individuals1, media portrayals often serve as the primary channel through which many learn about and engage with Jewish culture and experience. This reality, coupled with findings from the ADL's 2023 Audit of Antisemitic Incidents that antisemitic incidents in the US reached a record high in 2023 â an alarming surge of 140% from the previous year â brings into sharp focus the critical role of media in shaping societal attitudes and behaviors regarding Jews.Â 

Our Partnership with Common Sense Media

ADLâs partnership with Common Sense Media began during our ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign in 2020, which highlighted our shared commitment to combatting hate through all forms of media.

Common Sense Media already had a list featuring about 20 films that explored Jewish heritage, including movies about the Holocaust. Working closely with our friends at CSM, we have refined their selections into two distinct and more comprehensive lists. ""Movies That Illustrate and Celebrate the Jewish Experience"" now includes 31 titles, while ""Movies About the Holocaust"" features 14 films. These resources will continue to grow, adding new titles in the months and years to come and reflecting the dedication of both organizations to promoting a deep, nuanced understanding of Jewish history and life through film.

Methodology Behind the Film Selection

The ADL Media & Entertainment Institute has curated these lists with several key objectives in mind:

To showcase films that cover a broad spectrum of Jewish experiences, histories, and cultures, reflecting the community's rich diversity across different periods and regions of the world.
To highlight stories in which Jewish characters and themes are integral to the narrative and that do not perpetuate stereotypes or evoke antisemitic tropes.
To maintain a separate focus on Holocaust films in view of the significance of this tragic period not just to Jews but to all people.
To select films that have garnered acclaim and a positive reception from both critics and audiences, ensuring they not only entertain, but inspire, educate, and foster empathy.
To present these films as mirrors for Jewish individuals to see their own experiences reflected and as windows for others to learn about and appreciate the diversity and richness of Jewish life and history.

Expanding and Enriching the Conversation

This initiative is about more than just identifying compelling Jewish films: It's about sparking conversations and promoting understanding. These movies will generate discussion, education, and empathy as they offer viewers insights into the complexities of Jewish life, the beauty of Jewish culture, and the broader human experiences of love, humor, achievement, pain, and resilience. By engaging with these stories, audiences can also confront and challenge negative Jewish stereotypes and antisemitism that persist today.

A Call to Action: Join Us in Telling More Jewish Stories

As these lists continue to evolve, we eagerly anticipate the addition of more films that explore new aspects and stories from the Jewish world. We call upon writers, producers, filmmakers, and all storytellers to continue contributing to this rich tapestry by telling nuanced and diverse Jewish stories. Your voices are essential in broadening the narrative and ensuring that the fascinating diversity of the Jewish community is understood, appreciated, and respected.

This Jewish American Heritage Month, let us commit to learning from these films and sharing them widely. Letâs use them as a foundation for discussions of cultural diversity, religious tolerance, and the critical importance of representation in media. Together we can help create a more inclusive and empathetic world in which every cultureâs history and contributions are honored and celebrated. Join us in this vital mission and help illuminate the rich narrative of Jewish life for audiences everywhere.",,,

From Brazil to South Africa, from Italy to Australia, from Belgium to the United States: 2023 saw an increase of dozens of percentage points in the number of antisemitic incidents in Western countries in comparison to 2022.
Most countries with large Jewish populations recorded increases in the number of incidents also in the first nine months of 2023, before the war started; ""October 7 helped spread a fire that was already out of control""
Former Canadian Justice Minister presents an emergency plan

The Annual Antisemitism Worldwide Report, published by Tel Aviv University (TAU) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), reveals that 2023 saw an increase of dozens of percentage points in the number of antisemitic incidents in Western countries in comparison to 2022. A particularly steep increase was recorded following the October 7 attacks, but the first nine months of 2023, before the war started, also witnessed a relative increase in the number of incidents in most countries with large Jewish minorities, including the United States, France, the UK, Australia, Italy, Brazil, and Mexico.

""October 7 helped spread a fire that was already out of control,"" states the Report.

Countries recording steep increases

According to the Report, in New York, theÂ city with the largest Jewish population in the world, NYPD recorded 325 anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2023 in comparison to the 261 it recorded in 2022, LAPD recorded 165 in comparison to 86, and CPD 50 in comparison to 39. The ADL recorded 7,523 incidents in 2023 compared to 3,697 in 2022 (and according to a broader definition applied, it recorded 8,873); the number of assaults increased from 111 in 2022 to 161 in 2023 and of vandalism from 1,288 to 2,106.

Other countries also saw dramatic increases in the number of antisemitic attacks, according to data collected by the Report from governmental agencies, law enforcement authorities, Jewish organizations, media, and fieldwork.

In France, the number of incidents increased from 436 in 2022 to 1,676 in 2023 (the number of physical assaults increased from 43 to 85);
Incidents in the UK rose from 1,662 to 4,103 (physical assaults from 136 to 266);
In Argentina, incidents increased from 427 to 598;
In Germany, incidents rose from 2,639 to 3,614;
In Brazil, total incidents increased from 432 to 1,774;
In South Africa total incidents went from 68 to 207;
In Mexico, incidents rose from 21 to 78;
In the Netherlands, incidents increased from 69 to 154;
In Italy, the data increased from 241 to 454;
In Austria, the total incidents rose from 719 to 1,147.
Australia recorded 622 antisemitic incidents in October and November 2023, in comparison to 79 during the same period in 2022.

Antisemitic Incidents Increased also before October 7

While the dramatic increases in comparison to 2022 largely followed October 7, the Report emphasizes that most countries with large Jewish minorities saw relative increases also in the first nine months of 2023, before the war started.

For example, in the United States, ADL data (based on the narrower definition for antisemitic incidents) point to an increase from 1,000 incidents in October-December 2022 to 3,976 in the same period in 2023, but also to an increase from 2,697 incidents between January-September 2022 to 3,547 in the same period in 2023 (NYPD registered a decrease in that period, while LAPD an increase).

In France, the number of incidents during January-September 2023 increased to 434 from 329 during the same period in 2022; in Britain â from 1,270 to 1,404. In Australia, 371 incidents were recorded between January and September 2023, compared to 363 in the same period in 2022. On the other hand, Germany and Austria, where national programs for fighting antisemitism are applied, saw decreases.

Prof. Shavit: ""Concern that the curtain will descend on Jewish life in the West""

According to Prof. Uriya Shavit, Head of ""The Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry"" and the ""Irwin Cotler Institute,"" ""The year is not 1938, not even 1933. Yet if current trends continue, the curtain will descend on the ability to lead Jewish lives in the West â to wear a Star of David, attend synagogues and community centers, send kids to Jewish schools, frequent a Jewish club on campus, or speak Hebrew.""

Shavit said: ""With bomb threats against synagogues becoming a daily occurrence, Jewish existence in the West is forced to fortify itself, and the more it does so, the more the sense of security and normalcy is undermined. What the fight against antisemitism needs now is efforts focused on the hubs of poison, and the presentation of measurable and attainable goals. Foremost, the reality in which big companies make big money by spreading big hate has to end"".

Prof. Shavit added: ""The reality is that Israel, as a state, is limited in what it can do for Jewish communities. But even the little that can be done is not done. Israel does not have a meaningful strategic plan for combatting antisemitism that is based on the needs of Jewish communities. The main contributions of the government are pompous statements and sporadic initiatives. Responsibility for combatting antisemitism should be delegated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose officials are professionals who know the Jewish communities firsthand. The Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism is redundant. A small example of just how much so: A few months ago, we noted in another report that the link provided on their website in English for reporting antisemitic incidents leads to an empty page. It made headlines in the media. And what happened? Nothing. No one bothered to fix it. It still leads to an empty page. There are no limits to the negligence and lack of professionalism.""

According to Prof. Shavit, ""one of the biggest challenges of our time is how to mobilize support for the fight against antisemitism without making it the definer of Jewish identity"".

ADL Head Greenblatt: ""A Tsunami of Hate""

ADLâs CEO and National Director, Jonathan Greenblatt, said: ""The aftermath of Hamasâs horrific attack on Israel on October 7th was followed by a tsunami of hate against Jewish communities worldwide. Unprecedented levels of antisemitism have surged globally in the streets of London, New York, Paris, Santiago, Johannesburg and beyond. This yearâs report is incredibly alarming, with documented unprecedented levels of antisemitism, including in the US, where 2023 saw the highest number of antisemitic incidents in the US ever recorded by ADL. We are proud to partner with Tel Aviv University on this important annual report which will be used to inform governments and civil society and help push back against antisemitic trends"".

In a special essay for the Report, Greenblatt wrote: ""Antisemitism isnât just an abstract issue. It is a real-life threat to Jewish life in America and Jews around the world, and our history teaches us that we do not have the luxury to be indifferent when moments like these occur. That means we need to be clear-eyed about the threats we face and have the determination to confront them.""",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/joint-statement-adl-orthodox-union-conference-presidents-major-american,"New York, NY, May 3, 2024 ... The following is a joint statement issued today from ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), Orthodox Union, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Jewish Federations of North America, Hillel International, Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, and NCJW:

Our organizations met today with Secretary of Education Cardona, White House Domestic Policy Council Director Tanden, Deputy Secretary of Education Marten, and other senior officials - as we had requested last week. It was a positive and productive meeting. We appreciate the Secretary rapidly making himself available to us at this critical moment.

As organizations who have been dedicated to defending and supporting Jewish students experiencing harassment and violence on college campuses around the country, we thank the Secretary of Education for the opportunity this afternoon to share our urgent concerns.

We directly raised our urgent concerns surrounding the current climate of antisemitism on campus and the lack thus far of effective response. In this moment of crisis, we asked the Department to be specific in their follow up and implementation of this weekâs clear statement made by President Biden and to provide universities with a clear path to effective enforcement of that statement. By sharing specific recommendations, we urged the Administration to do more to protect Jewish students and the broader student community from intimidation, harassment, and violence.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/propaganda-fun-how-extremists-use-gai-camouflage-hate,"Disturbing memes and images created using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) are polluting social media with camouflaged hate and extremist propaganda.

Innovations in AI technology, plus a wider range of tools available than ever before, have enabled the use of AI image generators for nefarious purposesâsome of which have been coordinated and crowdsourced online. In the last year, one GAI feature has emerged as a favorite among extremists: The ability to embed shapes, symbols and phrases into an otherwise innocuous image.

In certain GAI models, users can set additional conditions for a text-to-image output, allowing an image of one thing (say, clouds in the sky) to simultaneously show a different, unrelated shape within it (a bicycle, for example). The embedded content is typically best seen from a distance, or when the main image is shrunk down.Â 

In innocuous cases, this technology can hide simple shapes like checkerboards, spirals or even QR codes. However, these techniques have been weaponized by extremists and antisemitic influencers to hide hate speech, hate symbols, antisemitic memes and even calls for violence.Â 
Â 

Hate symbols and memes

For the last year, extremists and purveyors of hateful rhetoric have been sharing GAI propaganda with their networks online. On Telegram, a member of the antisemitic hate network Goyim Defense League (GDL) shared a GAI scene of a winter cabin with an embedded âTotenkopf,â a hate symbol used often by white supremacists.

Â 

GhostEzra, a former QAnon adherent who now promotes antisemitic and neo-Nazi beliefs, shared a GAI image on Gab that shows several white women posing together in a field. The image also included an embedded Sonnenrad, a symbol that is often adopted by white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

Â 

These tools arenât just used to share hate symbolsâtheyâre also used to spread false narratives and conspiracy theories.

On Gab, antisemitic influencer Lucas Gage shared a GAI image of a tunnel, which also showed an antisemitic meme known as the Happy Merchant. Gage was referencing the January 2024 discovery of passageway found beneath Chabad headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, which led to a surge in antisemitic rhetoric and conspiracy theories online.

Â 

A Telegram channel affiliated with GDL shared a GAI image which shows a large group of people walking along a highway, as well as the Happy Merchant meme. The image caption references an âinvasion,â presumably referring to migrants entering the U.S.Â 
Â

Â 

On X, antisemitic conspiracy theorist Stew Peters shared a different version of the same conceptâthis time showing the Happy Merchant meme in a GAI image of people crossing a body of water. In the post, Peters asks, âThe invasion at our southern border is getting out of hand. Who is behind this madness?â

Â 

By combining antisemitism and xenophobic content, these individuals are promoting an antisemitic variation of the âGreat Replacementâ theoryâa conspiratorial white supremacist narrative which claims that Jews are bringing non-white immigrants into to the U.S. to replace white people.Â 
Â 

Calls for violenceÂ 

In many cases, GAI image tools are used to hide violent rhetoric in seemingly benign content. One image, shared in the earlier days of the Israel-Hamas war, calls for the destruction of Israel.Â

Others are explicitly violent, hiding acronyms like âTNDââa white supremacist shorthand for âtotal n***** deathââin a cotton field, an obvious allusion to slavery.

Â 

Encouragement and coordination

Around September 2023, users started creating threads on 4chan to encourage the use of GAI for what they call âmemetic warfare,â advising users to create ""propaganda for fun.""Â 

These posts include detailed guides, instructions and links on how to create the most effective GAI memes for âred pillingâ (or radicalizing) the masses. Â Participants typically share their GAI images in the replies, resulting in dozens of new crowdsourced memes per thread. Guides also include tips on how to hide radicalizing or offensive content âin plain sightâ using specific tools and workarounds.

Â 

Not all GAI memes can be attributed to the 4chan campaign. Similar images appear on a range of platforms including X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, TikTok and Telegram. Some of these spaces have accounts and channels dedicated solely to the creation of new and hateful GAI images.

Offline use

In early 2024, extremists began using hate symbol-embedded GAI images in their offline propaganda. While not yet widespread, this practice has the potential to become a concerning âreal worldâ trend.

On April 20, 2024, the Michigan chapter of the white supremacist group White Lives Matter (WLM) rented three roadside billboards in the metro Detroit area. The displays depicted white supremacist dog whistles and commemorated Adolf Hitlerâs birthdayâa day often celebrated by white supremacist groups. One of the billboards included what appears to be a GAI rendering of a mountain range with an embedded image of Hitler.

Â 

The billboards were purchased through Billboard4Me.com. The company apologized in a public statement, explaining that the messages were âdiscreet enough to make it past the companyâs filtersâ and noting WLMâs use of âdeceptive imagery.â

Challenges and recommendations

GAI propaganda images differ from other forms of hateful imagery or memes in three key ways: Speed, scale and skill. Speed, because they are far quicker to generate than other images, scale, because they can be crowdsourced from users around the world and skill, because they require virtually no artistic training or design expertise to make.Â 

In general, mitigating harmful GAI content comes with a unique set of challenges. Open-source GAI models allow users to essentially build their own chatbots or image generators, making such systems harder to regulate than those created with closed-source models. Also, by hiding calls for violence in these images, extremists are better able to evade content moderation on social media, because embedded text in an image is traditionally more difficult to detect than actual text in a post. This also means that more direct, targeted threats may go unnoticed, and therefore uninterrupted.

With this, social media platforms must invest in robust GAI policies and moderation to prevent such images from being posted. As it currently stands, these images are likely in a liminal space where they are technically in violation of hate policies, but an explicit rule which specifically prohibits hateful GAI content might not exist yet. Companies with proprietary AI models (such as OpenAi and Google) should also invest in technology which prevents the abuse of their tools for nefarious purposes.Â 

These companies should also work with experts in terrorism and extremism, such as the ADL Center on Extremism, to model the potential threats posed by extremist abuse of their products. Companies that provide open-source models should create robust auditing methods to ensure that the AI models they are hosting are not explicitly trained to spread hate and amplify extremist ideologies.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/news/weaponization-holocaust-against-israel,"By Ken Jacobson, ADL Deputy National DirectorÂ 

This is a particularly hard Yom Hashoah commemoration because of the suffering in Israel from October 7, deemed the worst massacre of Jews since the Shoah, and because over 100 are still being held hostage by the terrorists. These events, together with the worldwide surge in antisemitism, remind us, while not comparing anything to the horror of the Shoah, that the world hasnât learned a lot since that great tragedy.

It is particularly difficult, however, in another way. The purpose of Yom Hashoah and all the activities surrounding it is to remember the millions who perished, and to commit to never again. But what we are seeing too often in the past six months is not a commitment towards avoiding a future Holocaust, but the turning of the Holocaust into a weapon against the Jewish people.

It begins with the most basic theme of hostility toward Jews: Holocaust denial. Over the years, books were written âprovingâ that the Shoah never actually happened and that it was a fantasy concocted by Jews who controlled the media and sources of information to win support for Israel and the Jewish people. It had the additional motivation of trying to restore the legitimacy of fascism, a political ideology that was widely supported in Europe before WWII, but which lost any legitimacy with the evidence of the Holocaust.

We see today such denialism popping up all over with regard to October 7. Stories on social media and in certain Islamist circles simply deny that there was a massacre or rapes by Hamas. The claim again is Jewish control of the media. And the political purpose is to present Hamas not as having committed the worst terrorism since 9-11, but as a resistance group to alleged Israeli oppression. All of this even as there is wide circulation of videos produced by Hamas to celebrate their barbarism.

Second is the quickness to accuse Israel of genocide. Here again, the irony is that the very concept of international condemnation of genocide and commitment to prevent it, grew out of the genocide of the Nazis against the Jews. It is no accident that so many are quick to attribute that unholy word to Israel, considering the history of anti-Zionism and the guilt that pervades the West over the murder of six million Jews.

Let us recall that it was in 1975 that the UN voted to deem Zionism, the liberation movement of the Jewish people in pursuit of self-determination in their ancestral homeland, to be equal to racism. This meant that the founding of Israel, which was what Zionism was about, was beyond the pale. It was in that light, with the dissemination around the world for decades of this prejudicial judgment against the Jewish state, that the most horrific attack took place. And then when Israel did what any government would have to do, defend its people, the world was set up to denounce the victims as committing genocide.

The other element in this assault on Israelâs good name, is the need to psychologically balance the sense of guilt. The more that was learned about the Shoah over the decades, the more it became evident that it never could have happened without centuries of deeply embedded anti-Jewish attitudes which had an impact on the perpetrators, the collaborators and the bystanders. Now there was an opportunity to even the score by saying âyou Jews have your genocide committers just as we had ours.â

Third, is the tendency to put Israel and Jews who support it in the oppressor class. Those who hold those views see events since October 7 as further proof that the Jewish state represents the colonialist oppression of indigenous people.

This glib pronouncement that has so much power in certain circles simply ignores three realities about the Jewish people and the state of Israel.

First, for many years, a significant proportion of the Jews of Israel were survivors of the Shoah who made it to Israel after the most harrowing experiences, including often the murder of their entire families by the Nazis. And, as time has passed and survivors pass away, it is their children who have to live with the knowledge of what their parents lived through and how arriving in Israel was their redemption from pure evil.

Second, it ignores the fact that over half the Jewish population of Israel are from the Middle East, their families have lived in the region for centuries, and they ended up in Israel when life became intolerable for them in their countries of origin.

And third, the Jewish people survived for millennia in the diaspora often under the harshest of conditions simply on the hope and aspiration of returning to their ancestral homelandÂ  as a nation, the basis for the existence and identity of the people, the land of Israel.

To deem Israel a colonialist nation is to ignore all three factors.

In sum, the effort to use the Holocaust against the Jewish people is despicable but not surprising. The worst periods of anti-Jewish hatred rely on lies and fantasies that justify their actions.Â 

For many years, the Jewish people worried that the passage of time and the passing away of survivors would lead to forgetting about the Shoah. Now there is an additional factor, the use of the Holocaust against Israeli actions in Gaza and the Jewish people, which can only play into Holocaust denial, already a growing phenomenon.

Let us all stand up against this dangerous antisemitic development.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/northern-new-jersey-jewish-communities-face-wave-israel-related-antisemitism,"âGo back to Auschwitz, bitch!â This disturbing antisemitic refrain rang out repeatedly at an anti-Israel protest held across the street from a synagogue in Fort Lee, NJ on November 5, 2023. More recently, in March and April 2024, anti-Israel protests outside of synagogues in nearby Teaneck have included protesters explicitly calling for the exclusion of âZionistsâ from the community.Â 

Â 

These incidents are part of a wave of antisemitic and extreme anti-Zionist activity in northern New Jersey that the ADL Center on Extremism has tracked in the region since early 2023 and in particular after Hamasâs October 7 terrorist attack on Israel. This trend continues to impact the local community more than six months later. Northern New Jersey has a significant Jewish population, and recent activities have served to foment tension and fear.Â Â 

The cities and towns of Teaneck, Englewood, Paterson, Clifton, Montclair, West Orange and South Orange are among those that have seen some of the most concerning antisemitic activity in the region in this period.Â Â 

Â 

These Israel-related antisemitic incidents vary in nature, including physical intimidation, in-person and online harassment, vandalism and antisemitic rhetoric during protests. These incidents have also spanned a number of location types â including synagogues, Jewish and non-Jewish schools, Jewish-owned businesses, city council and school board meetings, public areas and online.Â 

Antisemitism and anti-Israel activism in the region in the immediate aftermath of October 7Â 

Immediately after Hamasâs October 7 attack, individuals targeted synagogues and other Jewish institutions across northern New Jersey with Israel-related antisemitic harassment, both on the ground and virtually. These actions undoubtedly crossed the line from legitimate political criticism of Israel to antisemitism.Â 

Â 

For example, on October 7, an individual shouted, âLong live Hamasâ at a synagogue in Clifton during Simchat Torah celebrations. On October 11, a Jewish Community Center (JCC) in Teaneck received a phone call from an individual who stated that they wished to donate to Hamas. On October 17, a synagogue in Hoboken received an antisemitic message through their online contact form that read: âNothing nicer than seeing dead Jews littered on the concert ground like the trash you are. May Christ grant victory to the arabs [sic] to exterminate you Yiddish N-----s from the face of the earthâ¦Die you fucking heeb parasites and may all your children be raped to death.âÂ 

Â 

Anti-Israel activists also began to organize largescale protests in the region after October 7. In Teaneck, groups of both pro-Israel and anti-Israel demonstrators gathered outside of a Township Council meeting on October 17 at which local officials passed a resolution expressing support for Israel. Some of the anti-Israel protesters harassed Jewish individuals who were leaving the meeting by shouting, âGas them, you filthy Jewsâ and, âGo run you dirty Jew bitch, we will get you!â Protestors also blocked and banged on Jewish individualsâ cars as they attempted to leave.Â 

Â 

Members of the anti-Zionist group Neturei Karta and other anti-Israel protesters gather outside of the Municipal Court in Englewood, NJ during a City Council meeting on October 24, 2023.

Â 

In nearby Englewood, both pro-Israel and anti-Israel demonstrators gathered outside of a City Council meeting on October 24 after the council passed a resolution the previous week condemning Hamas. Among those present on the anti-Israel side were Rabbi Dovid Feldman and other members of Neturei Karta, a radical anti-Zionist Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jewish group based in the greater New York City area.Â Â 

Â 

Protesters burned an Israeli flag and displayed signs with messages such as, âThe Zionists ignited the fire both now and in the past.â As Jewish individuals left the meeting, a protester told them, âSderot [referencing a city in southern Israel that was targeted in the Hamas attack], October the 7, itâs going to happen again, soon.â Five of the anti-Israel protesters were arrested on charges that included rioting, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.Â 

Â 

Inside the meeting, Ricardo âRickâ Whilby â an Englewood resident who has a history of promoting conspiratorial antisemitic content â disrupted the proceedings by shouting profanities at pro-Israel Jewish community members and telling them, âYou need to go back to Germany, Europe, Belgium, wherever the fuck youâre from. Fuck outta here! Nobody gave you the land. Nobody! The Jews are in exile. Why do you have a country?âÂ 

Continued promotion of Israel-related antisemitism in public areasÂ 

Israel-related antisemitic public meeting disruptions continued to be a common occurrence in the region in the subsequent weeks and months.Â Â 

Â 

In West Orange on November 13, 2023 for example, individuals spewed anti-Zionist and antisemitic comments at a Board of Education meeting, heckling a Jewish speaker who shared that he had lost two relatives who had been killed in terror attacks in Israel. The hecklers mockingly interjected, âJust two?â In another instance, on January 16, Rick Whilby returned to the Englewood City Council meeting, saying, âThe Zionists are doing exactly what the Nazis did back then.âÂ 

Â 

In Teaneck, tension in the community increased when, on November 29, students at Teaneck High School staged a walkout to protest Israelâs actions in Gaza. Students marched from the high school to the townâs municipal building, where they gathered outside to listen to speeches. Rabbi Dovid Feldman and Rick Whilby were among the featured speakers.Â 

Â

Â 

Drawing cheers from the crowd of students and community members in attendance, Whilby stated, âItâs not that Palestine will be free from the river to the sea. It will be free from the river to the sea by any means necessary.âÂ Â 

Â 

Whilby also suggested that U.S. police brutality and related issues have been imported from Israel: âI want to talk about the Israelization of American police. If you look around you, you see these police officersâ¦Understand that they are here to occupy.âÂ 

Â 

The student walkout sparked heated debate at subsequent Teaneck Township Council and Board of Education meetings. On December 13, for example, Whilby spoke at a Teaneck Board of Education meeting and used his remarks to reference biblical passages commonly cited by antisemites to denigrate Jewish people: âYou are of your father the devilâ¦I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews but are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.â He also echoed his refrain from the student walkout in November by calling for a free Palestine âfrom the river to the sea, by any fucking means necessaryâ and, directing his comments toward the pro-Israel community members gathered in the meeting room, saying, âYou guys are wicked!âÂ 

Â 

Anti-Israel activists have also used nontraditional mediums to promote antisemitism in public areas in the region. For example, the New Jersey-based nonprofits Voice for Humanity Project and Palestinian American Community Center (PACC) have sponsored billboards and digital trucks in recent months that, in many cases, have displayed commentary and imagery that play intoâ¯classic antisemitic tropes.Â Â 

Â 

A digital billboard truck sponsored by the Voice for Humanity Project displays a conspiratorial antisemitic message about alleged Israeli organ harvesting as part of a car caravan protest in northern New Jersey on December 31, 2023.Â 

Â 

These digital billboard truck messages include conspiratorial claims about Israel allegedly âstealingâ Palestinian organs â an unfounded conspiracy theory reminiscent of the age-oldâ¯antisemitic blood libel tropeâ¯that accuses Jews of murdering non-Jewish children to use their blood to perform religious rituals.â¯Other messages include antisemitic Nazi and Holocaustâ¯comparisons, including the message: âIsrael is the New Nazi Germany.âÂ 

Â 

Car caravans are another popular tactic of anti-Israel protesters and regularly feature explicitly antisemitic messages and expressions of support for terrorism. Ongoing weekly car caravans between Paterson and Teaneck, for example, intimidate Jewish community members with their intentionally disruptive routes through both commercial and residential districts and their open support for terrorism.Â Â 

Â 

During car caravans that traversed the two towns on March 31 and April 14, multiple participants wore clothing bearing the image of Abu Obaida, spokesperson for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades â Hamasâs military wing. Car caravan participants have also recorded Jewish residents along the route and shared footage of them on social media without their permission.Â

Â 

Direct targeting of the Jewish communityÂ 

Many anti-Israel activists claim that their intent is to target and disrupt so-called âZionistâ individuals, organizations, businesses and events, but they fail to recognize or understand how Zionism is intertwined with the Jewish community, and the impact of their actions is undoubtedly antisemitic. As noted above, Jewish individuals, organizations and places of worship have been targeted with anti-Israel harassment and vandalism since the immediate aftermath of October 7, and that activity has continued since then.Â Â 

Â 

The anti-Israel protest in Fort Lee on November 5 had been called in response to a âRally for Israelâ event being held that evening by a coalition of local synagogues that included Young Israel of Fort Lee (which hosted the event), Bet Yosef Sephardic Congregation of Fort Lee, Chabad of Fort Lee, and Congregation Beth Israel of the Palisades. In addition to the âGo back to Auschwitzâ comment highlighted above, protesters also shouted, âGo back to Europe!â and chanted the antisemitic Arabic-language slogans âKhaybar, Khaybar, oh Jewsâ and âStrike, strike, Tel Avivâ â two chants which celebrate a historic Jewish military defeat and call for further violence against the modern state of Israel, respectively.Â Â 

Â 

Other incidents in November took place on the campus of Ramapo College in Mahwah, where a Jewish student was harassed by an individual who yelled, âDeath to Israel!â In Harrington Park, an individual yelled, âFucking Jewsâ and urinated on the driveway of a home displaying a pro-Israel sign. Later that month, a synagogue in Closter received a direct message on Facebook that stated, âFuck u israelll [sic].âÂ Â 

Â 

In December, an individual made anti-Israel and anti-Zionist posts on the Facebook page of the Paramus-based Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey. In Montclair, an individual stole an Israeli flag that had been displayed on a Jewish professorâs office at Montclair State University and wrote a note in its place accusing the professor of being a âgenocide loverâ and stating, âFuck Zionism and Israel.â Also in December in Maplewood, a vandal spray-painted anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian graffiti on signs on the lawn of a synagogue.Â 

Â 

Jewish-owned businesses have been targeted on multiple occasions. In November, a Jewish-owned Teaneck restaurant received harassing phone calls accusing them of âsupporting lies in the Middle Eastâ and âputting genocide and apartheid in the food.â The restaurant also received a wave of antisemitic Google reviews claiming customers found blood in the food. Also in November, posters raising awareness about Israeli hostages were torn down from a Judaica store in West Orange.Â 

Â 

Similarly, in January, vandals targeted a Teaneck kosher restaurant by covering up the Israeli hostage posters in its windows with signs reading, âMurdered by Israel.â In Tenafly, vandals targeted a Jewish community center â the Kaplen JCC on the Palisades â by defacing a sign in front of the building advertising a February 10 event titled, âStand-Up for the Arts,â featuring Jewish comedian Michael Rapaport.Â Â 

Â 

On February 27, a wine tasting event in Passaic that was hosted by the Jewish Link and exhibited various Israeli and kosher wineries was targeted by protesters who chanted slogans that included: âSay it loud, say it clear: we donât want no Zionists here,â âThere is only one solution; Intifada, revolutionâ and âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.âÂ 

Â 

In January and February, a âWe Stand with Israelâ lawn sign in a Ridgefield Park residentâs yard was repeatedly vandalized, including with red spray paint. In at least one instance, the perpetrator placed multiple baby dolls next to the sign and covered the dolls and the sign in ketchup, seemingly to simulate blood.Â 

Â 

The targeting of Jewish institutions further escalated in March and April, when anti-Israel protesters held multiple demonstrations directly outside of synagogues in Teaneck. On March 10, hundreds of anti-Israel protesters gathered outside Teaneckâs Keter Torah synagogue to protest an informational Israeli real estate event. The planned protest had received significant attention in the days leading up to it, after a video went viral online showing Teaneck resident Rich Siegel criticizing the real estate event during a Township Council meeting in late February.Â Â 

Â 

Siegel is a longtime anti-Zionist activist and self-described âex-Jewâ whose activities include frequently demonizing Judaism and Jewish people, calling for anti-Zionist protesters to increase their efforts to target synagogues, and maintaining relationships with Holocaust deniers and other notable antisemites like Gilad Atzmon and Henry Herskovitz. Siegelâs remarks at the February council meeting drew international attention and sparked allegations that Keter Torah and the town of Teaneck were potentially violating domestic and international laws by allowing the real estate event to take place.

Â 

Anti-Israel protesters march through Teaneck, NJ on their way to Keter Torah synagogue on March 10, 2024.

Â 

To protest the event, anti-Israel activists met in town and marched through a largely Jewish residential neighborhood before arriving in front of the synagogue, where they continued to chant and hold signs that included extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric and support for terror. Protesters called for the exclusion of Zionists, chanting, âSay it loud, say it clear: we donât want no Zionists hereâ and holding signs with messages that included, âZionist greed will never be satisfiedâ and âZionism = terrorism.âÂ Â 

Â 

Protesters also displayed a photograph of Leila Khaled, a longtime active leader of the US-designated terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) who is known for her role in the terrorist hijacking of two civilian airliners in 1969 and 1970.Â 

Â 

On April 1, another large anti-Israel protest took place in Teaneck outside Congregation Bnai Yeshurun. The synagogue was hosting an event in recognition of ZAKA, an Israeli organization of volunteer emergency rescue workers who were involved in recovering, cleaning and identifying the bodies of those killed in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack.Â Â 

Â 

The anti-Israel protesters repeatedly shared antisemitic and extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric, including chanting, âGo back to Europe!â at Jewish individuals. Protesters held signs with messages that included such statements as, âZionist: are the prophet killers; Zionist: are the (real) terrorists in this world; Zionist: should be destroy [sic]!âÂ 

Â 

Multiple known antisemitic and anti-Zionist agitators were present, including Rick Whilby, Rich Siegel, and Nerdeen Kiswani, the leader of the New York-based anti-Zionist group Within Our Lifetime-United for Palestine (WOL).Â Â 

Â 

Whilby used an anti-LGBTQ+ slur and shouted at pro-Israel individuals that they were âfucking Nazisâ and âdog food,â while Kiswani wore a button bearing an image of Abu Obaida. Protesters also displayed a banner bearing the name and image of Ahmad Saâadat, the imprisoned Secretary General of the PFLP.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-brandeis-center-file-title-vi-complaint-against-umass-amherst,"Complaint claims school failed to protect students, including after violent antisemitic assault

May 2, 2024 â ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law today announced that they submitted a formal complaint against the University of Massachusetts Amherst with the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights (OCR) alleging that the university has failed to address the severe discrimination and harassment of Jewish and Israeli students, which fostered a hostile antisemitic environment.

The complaint alleges that since the events on Oct. 7, Jewish students at UMass-Amherst have faced a litany of antisemitic incidents, including a violent assault. The complaint seeks remedies under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

âEven after a violent antisemitic assault on campus, UMass has done nothing to make Jewish students feel safe and, infuriatingly, this assault is the tip of the iceberg â part of a persistent pattern of enabling hate against Jews,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. âThis is a textbook example of an administration that is deliberately indifferent and negligent â the U.S. Department of Education must intervene immediately.â

In an attackÂ corroborated by multiple eyewitnesses, the Complainant, UMass-Amherst Senior Dylan Jacobs was called a âZionist s***bagâ and then punched and kicked repeatedly by another student. A small Israeli flag was ripped from his hand, stabbed and thrown in a trash can. While UMass-Amherst was quick to condemn the attack, it did little beyond that. Instead, it spent nearly six months ignoring the incident, despite requests from the victim to address the matter.

Mr. Jacobs was also bizarrely subject to a no-contact directive without any basis provided, told he must stay away from members of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), but the SJP members could still approach him. This could effectively create a situation in which Mr. Jacobs is in violation of the directive through no fault of his own. But, without explanation, the SJP members were not subjected to a no-contact order.Â UMass-Amherst failed to provide Mr. Jacobs with any information regarding the basis of said no-contact directive and effectively established a potentially dangerous dynamic.

âA Jewish student was charged at and repeatedly and violently punched and kicked for holding an Israeli flag at a Hillel Bring Them Home event, and what did the university do? They issued a statement urging âpeaceful advocacyâ and simultaneously condemned Islamophobia. Adding insult to injury, it took them five months to hold a hearing on the violent assault and they have yet to hold the attacker accountable. What kind of message does this send to the UMass community? It is no wonder anti-Semitic protestors continue to block entrances and exits to buildings, call for violence against Jews, harass and intimidate Jewish students, disrupt events and spew anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,â stated Kenneth L. Marcus, chairman of the Brandeis Center and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights for George W. Bush and Donald Trump. âFollowing the law, holding perpetrators accountable and issuing consequences is not rocket science. Itâs beyond shameful that we have to call in the Department of Education to get a school to address a violent anti-Semitic assault and ensure other students arenât similarly attacked.â

Â 

Additional specific examples of antisemitic incidents cited in the complaint includeÂ genocidal chants, antisemitic slurs, and physical threats. There were statements from UMass-Amherst student groups praising Hamasâs terrorism as justified âresistance,â and disruptive pro-Hamas protests that prevented people from physically entering or exiting buildings, working, or studying.

There was also online harassment of Jewish students in a group chat, which included derogatory, vile, and antisemitic language. This rhetoric was so egregious that a perpetratorâs account was banned from a UMass public school page.

The complaint urges OCR to compel the universityâs administration to implement a series of measures necessary to secure the safety of Jewish students at UMass, including issuing a public statement condemning antisemitic hostility and the BDS movement, urging the university to incorporate the IHRA working definition of antisemitism into its campus policies to better recognize the types of antisemitic discrimination confronting Jewish students, and providing mandatory antisemitism training to university administrators, faculty, students and staff.

In addition to ADL and the Brandeis Center, Jason Torchinsky and Erielle Davidson from Holtzman Vogel Baran Torchinsky & Josefiak PLLC and Douglas Brooks from Libby Hoopes Brooks & Mulvey, P.C. are serving as the plaintiffâs counsel in this case.

Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/coe-analysis-iran-attack-sparks-surge-online-antisemitic-threats,"A new analysis by the ADL Center on Extremism (COE) has found that online expressions of antisemitism on Telegram, a prominent messaging platform frequented by purveyors of hate speech, increased dramatically in the days following the Iranian regime's unprecedented assault on Israel on April 13, 2024. The weekend attack consisted of some 300 drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The Iranian regimeâs Lebanese proxy Hezbollah and other Tehran-backed militias based in Iraq, Syria and Yemen also fired weapons at Israel.

Â 

Overall, COEâs findings suggest that antisemitic individuals from a range of ideologies feel emboldened and inspired by the Iranian regime's attack with a noticeable uptick in online threats targeting Jews and Israelis. This surge appears to reflect concerning coalitions between groups with different antisemitic ideologies.Â 

Â 

Telegram, where content moderation is notoriously weak, boasts hundreds of millions of active users. To process the sheer number of posts, which can number in the tens of thousands per day, COE focused its Telegram monitoring efforts on approximately 2,000 extremist channels covering a wide range of ideologies, including right-wing, left-wing and Islamist extremism, as well as conspiracy theories, and anti-Israel and anti-Zionist sentiment. However, white supremacist extremist ideology makes up the majority of the channels COE monitors.Â 

Â 

To conduct its analysis, COE utilized a proprietary methodology that leverages machine learning models and various other data science techniques to find targeted threats against Jews and Israelis and eliminate irrelevant messages (such as excerpts from news articles that quote threatening language used by others but are not themselves threatening). This methodology captured most threat instances and was validated quantitatively and qualitatively by subject matter experts. In addition to using this type of machine learning to focus on the most pressing threats, COE confirmed the targets of threatening messages based on the keywords they contain, the channel in which they were posted and by qualitative expert classification.Â 

Â 

From April 1 to April 14, 2024, threatening Telegram messages specifically targeting Jews -- already at an elevated level following the October 7, 2023, attacks against Israel â rose considerably. The number of antisemitic threats mentioning Jews was up 64.1%, to 64 per day from April 1 to April 14. Meanwhile, the number of threats that mentioned âZionistsâ was up 109.1%, to 23 per day by April 14, and the number of threats that specifically mentioned âIsraelâ was up 242.5%, to 137 daily posts in that same timeframe. By April 14, nearly 16% of all threatening messages from the monitored Telegram channels targeted Israel. (These numbers are very likely undercounts, as antisemitism is often cloaked in coded speech that is more difficult to detect).Â 

Â 

These messages not only traffic in traditional antisemitic tropes and propaganda, they also include expressions of sympathy (and praise) for the Iranian regime and its allies, as well as celebrations of violence against Israelis and Jews.â¯Â 

Â 

Â 

Such expressions at times transcend typical ideological divisions: Some messages imply that individuals who are otherwise unsympathetic to the Iranian regime would take their side in a conflict with Israel.Â 

Â 

Â 

Finally, in addition to examining the content of threatening antisemitic posts, COE was able to pin down the specific channels accounting for the increase.Â  COE analyzed Telegram data from the days surrounding the Iranian regime's attack against data that preceded it to understand which channels were seeing surges.Â Â 

Â 

On many of the channels identified in the analysis, antisemitic threats and calls for violence are par for the course. However, the concentration of activity on these few toxic channels is striking. COE's analysis found the top five Telegram channels that, together, account for over 45% of the increase in threatening antisemitic posts:Â Â 

Homework Helpers 88 â Chat, a Telegram account (with a white supremacist callout in its name) associated with a network of online trolls who livestream themselves spreading antisemitic and white supremacist sentiments through online video chat websites, including monkey.app and the now-defunct Omegle.

GDL Chat 2.0, a channel where individuals associated with the antisemitic Goyim Defense League share their extremist views and activities.

Professional cyberbullying Russians, a channel where far-right pro-Ukraine users share ""pro-white"" memes and engage in networking.Â 

Global Resistance News (also known as Cultures of Resistance), an antisemitic, anti-Zionist Telegram channel which has called for âdeath and nothing but death to Zion.âÂ 

GHOSTCHAT, a channel associated with antisemitic influencer GhostEzra (aka Robert Smart of Florida), where users regularly express antisemitic, neo-Nazi and other hateful and extremist views.Â

Â 

Overall, antisemitic threats on Telegram increased since April 1, 2024, pointing to a broad coalition of antisemites united by their shared vitriol towards Jews and Israel.Â Â 

Â 

The sharp rise in antisemitic threats online after the Iranian regime's attack on Israel shows how a major world event can encourage widespread expressions of antisemitism. Our findings, which are not exhaustive, suggest a correlation between the increase in threats against Israel and a rise in threats targeting Jews and Zionists in the U.S. and elsewhere, including those with no direct connection to Israel. The Iranian regime's attack on Israel, which has undermined regional stability, may also embolden groups and individuals to act on their antisemitic beliefs.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/meaningful-picture-books-about-holidays-and-observances,"For many people, holidays and observances are important aspects of their lives. A holiday or observance is a special day or days, usually observed every year, that includes celebrating, observing, remembering and honoring something or someone meaningful or significant.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/adl-calls-immediate-action-universities-ensure-safe-conclusion,"ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) calls on universities and colleges to enforce their own codes of conduct and campus policies to restore calm and ensure students can learn, study, participate in activities and celebrate commencement and the close of the semester as they deserve â in a safe, welcoming environment.â¯ The current disruptive protests on campus have been marked by vicious antisemitic rhetoric, harassment and intimidation.â¯ This has had a serious impact on Jewish students.â¯ Indeed, all students â whether Jewish or not â are being impacted by attempts to block their passages to class and other activities and by disruptive tactics interfering with classes and other events. This is unacceptable and violative of many codes of conduct.â¯ Such violations cannot go unaddressed; there must be swift and certain consequences. Administrators must communicate clearly and immediately that the following policies are in place and will be enforced:Â 

Enforce Rules and Ensure Consequences for Disruptive, Unsanctioned Protests
Â 
Enforce time, place, manner restrictions and permitting requirements.
Enforce campus codes of conduct during protests, and ensure that there are serious consequences for violations, up to and including suspension, expulsion, and bans from participating in campus events, including commencement.
Make clear that professors and other faculty members cannot cancel class or exams for the purpose of encouraging students to attend protests; and/or offer class credit for participation in such protests.Â 
Make clear that students will not be able to make up exams or receive credit for exams or school work missed due to protests.Â 
Â 
Plan for and Protect Upcoming Commencement Events
Â 
Make a plan â follow protocols used for concerts, sporting events on campus â e.g., tickets required for entrance, clear instructions for what can and cannot be brought into graduation, clear guidelines for what graduates can and cannot display or hold during the ceremony, etc.â¯The plan should include a clear protocol for admissions, crowd control, and preventing interference with any ingress or egress; as well as a process for swiftly and safely escorting individuals from the premises if, after a clear warning, protesters persist in disruptive conduct that interferes with the ceremony.â¯
Clearly communicateâ¯these guidelines and the fact that there will be swift and certain consequences for violations â including removal from the graduation proceedings. Enforce these guidelines and ensure consequences immediately upon breach.Â 

Since the start of the 2023 Fall semester, ADL has been communicating with university and college leaders about the rise of antisemitism on campus and how leaders can respond. Â We did so based on our own research and data collection and in line with the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which called for a whole of society approach, including for action by our educational institutions. Â Since October 7, the issue has only become more acute, with a shocking rise in antisemitism, following the Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing war. Â 

On October 8, we reached out to campuses urging action to demonstrate solidarity and ensure security for Jewish students, faculty and others on campus. Â On November 7, with key partners, we launched the Campus Antisemitism Legal Line to answer the overwhelming volume of requests for legal support from students and their parents in the wake of incidents on campus. Â To date, there have been over 600 inquires received from individuals regarding more than 225 campuses.

As the fall semester concluded, we again urged action in the face of what had been a devastating time period for our students, with an open letter calling on campus leaders to use the winter break to prepare for the new semester and to commit to adopting new policies where necessary and enforcing existing codes of conduct for students and faculty. We urged campus leadership to commit to No Tolerance for Antisemitism and offered six core commitments that would create a pathway to achieving that status. Â 

In the ensuing months, we have drafted sample policies and launched the first Campus Antisemitism Report Card. We have created resources for administrators, students, parents and alumni. We have offered to be a partner in helping to solve the crisis on campus.

While some universities have adopted new policies, pledged to make changes in the next school year, or even taken some disciplinary action against students, faculty and student organizations violating rules and codes of conduct, too many others have failed to do so. The result has been another semester marked by shocking levels of antisemitic incidents on campus. Â 

And now, as graduation season is upon us, on campuses across the country, disruptive protests and encampments marked by antisemitic rhetoric, harassment, intimidation and in some cases violence are taking place.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/campus-antisemitism-surges-amid-encampments-and-related-protests-columbia-and,"Anti-Zionist student groups on more than 100 U.S. college and university campuses have established âencampmentsâ in recent days to ostensibly protest Israelâs actions in Gaza and their academic institutionsâ alleged âcomplicityâ in those actions. College campuses have been the site of many tense anti-Israel protests and antisemitic incidents since the start of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that began with Hamasâs October 7, 2023, terrorist attack. These recent encampments and related protests in support of a âPopular University for Gazaâ initiative have brought those tensions to a boiling point as protesters ramp up their activity to push universities to divest from Israel.Â 

Â 

Several protesters, including those who are participating in the encampments or have demonstrated in support of the encampments, have expressed explicit support for Hamas terrorism and urged Hamas to commit further violence against Israel. Some protesters have also directly confronted Jewish students on and near campus, at times using antisemitic rhetoric. Many protestors have called for âZionistsâ to be excluded from campus communities. The concerning actions and rhetoric that has often stemmed from the encampments only serves to further marginalize Jewish students as they already face a disturbing level of antisemitism on many of the impacted campuses.Â 

BackgroundÂ 

Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapters have played a key role in organizing many of these encampments. National SJP, the umbrella organization of these local chapters, put out a call to action on April 20, 2024, urging college students, staff and faculty to âjoin the Popular Universityâ and âtake back our institutions,â adding âwe will seize our universities and force the administration to divest.â On April 22, National SJP released the âmission statementâ of these âPopular University for Gazaâ protests, writing:Â Â 

ââ¦We as students will reclaim our power on campusâthere will be no classes or compliance with our institutions so long as their shameless profiteering off of our genocide persists. Through the student movement for a popular university, we will transform our mass mobilization into sustained, tangible powerâ¦We will seize control of our institutions, campus by campus, until Palestine is free.âÂ 

In addition to SJP, numerous other campus and community anti-Zionist groups â many of which have played key roles in organizing anti-Israel protests since October 7 â have supported calls for college encampments. These groups include the national bodies and/or local chapters of American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), Dissenters, Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), Palestine Action, Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), Samidoun, Students for Democratic Society (SDS), Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and others.

Individual influencers, such as Mohammed el-Kurd and Jenan Matari, are also supporting this call to action.Â Â

Â 

Among the early encampments were those established at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN on March 26 and at Tufts University in Medford, MA on April 7. Students at Smith College in Northampton, MA also occupied the campus administration building from March 27 to April 9. The national profile of these protests rose on April 17, when students at Columbia University in New York, NY began their encampment in the center of campus.Â Â 

Heeding calls from organizations already engaged in encampment protests, student groups at a growing number of additional colleges and universities across the country have held or announced plans to hold demonstrations in solidarity with the student encampments and the broader âPopular University for Gazaâ initiative.â¯â¯Â 

Â 

Solidarity protests were held over the weekend of April 19 on campuses such as Harvard University (Cambridge, MA); Northwestern University (Evanston, IL); Ohio State University (Columbus, OH); Princeton University (Princeton, NJ); and Temple University (Philadelphia, PA). Additional protests were then announced for the week of April 22 at more than a dozen additional colleges and counting.â¯â¯Â 

Â 

As of April 22, there had been encampments established on 13 campuses. By April 26, that number has more than quadrupled, with at least 53 encampments.â¯These encampments span 22 states and range from large, public universities to small, private colleges. They include seven of the eight Ivy League colleges.Â Â 

Â 

The full list of schools with ongoing or recent encampments is available at the end of this article.Â

Support for Terror Against Israel and Violence On CampusÂ 

Â 

Protesters at Columbia University, including students affiliated with the encampment and other individuals who have gathered at the campusâ main entrance gates in solidarity, have repeatedly expressed explicit support for violence.Â Â 

Â 

For example, there have been multiple instances of support for Hamas and their October 7 attack on Israel. On April 17, a protester yelled âWe are Hamasâ and others chanted: âAl-Qassam [in reference to the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamasâs military wing] you make us proud, kill another soldier now!â On April 20, an anti-Israel protester on Columbiaâs campus held a sign that read âAl-Qasamâs [sic] next targetsâ with an arrow pointing toward a group of pro-Israel counter-protesters standing nearby waving Israeli and American flags.Â 

Signs displayed at protests related to the encampment at Columbia University, including a sign referencing Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamasâs military wing (left) and a sign featuring an image of Ahmad Saâadat and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) logo (right).Â 

Â 

In the late evening hours of April 18, anti-Israel protesters who were gathered just outside the campus gates to support the student encampment reportedly screamed at a group ofÂ  Jewish students, repeatedly referencing Hamasâs October 7 attack on Israel. One protester stated: âRemember the 7th of October? That will happen not one more time, not five more timesâ¦but 10,000 more times.â Another added, âNever forget the 7th of Octoberâ¦The 7th of October is about to be every f***ing day for you. You ready?âÂ 

Â 

During a speech on campus at the Columbia encampment on April 20, Tai Lee, a member of Writers Against the War on Gaza (WAWOG) who has previously expressed explicit support for Hamasâs October 7 attack at anti-Israel protests in New York City, said, âLet it be known that it was the Al-Aqsa Flood [Hamasâs name for the October 7 attack] that put the global Intifada back on the table again. And it is the sacrificial spirit of the Palestinian Freedom Fighters that will guide every struggle on every corner of the earth to victory.âÂ 

Also at Columbia, a sign displayed on one of the encampment tents read: ââWhoever is in solidarity with our corpses but not our rockets is a hypocrite and not one of us.â Until Victory.âÂ 

Â 

Protesters on multiple campuses have also displayed the symbols of US-designated terror groups, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Hezbollah. For example, encampment protesters at both California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt and University of Minnesota, Twin Cities displayed flags with the PFLP logo. At Princeton University, where students launched their encampment on April 25, a protester displayed a Hezbollah flag.Â 

Flags bearing the logos of the US-designated terror groups Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Hezbollah are seen at the encampment protests at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (left) and Princeton University (right).

Â 

Protesters have also glorified figures affiliated with terror groups, such as the PFLP and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. At Columbia, protesters displayed a sign with the PFLP logo alongside an image of Ahmad Saâadat, the imprisoned general secretary of the terror group. Signs also bore the names and photographs ofâ¯convicted terrorists such as Nasser Abu Hamid, al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades; Walid Daqqa, PFLP; Leila Khaled, PFLP; Ahmad Qatamesh, PFLP; and others.â¯â¯Â 

Â 

Protesters at Yale University, who began demonstrating earlier in the week as part of a hunger strike and officially launched their encampment on April 19, similarly displayed signs with illustrations of Walid Daqqa and Leila Khaled.â¯â¯Â 

Â 

Signs displayed at the Yale University encampment honor PFLP-affiliated Walid Daqqa (left) and Leila Khaled (right).â¯

Â 

At the University of Michigan, where students began their encampment on April 22, protesters hung a banner next to their tents that read âLONG LIVE THE INTIFADA.â Intifada is a referenceâ¯to two historical periods in the late 1980s and early 2000s during which Palestinian terrorists committed indiscriminate acts of violence against Israelis, including suicide bombings, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people.Â Â 

Â 

At Columbia on April 20, protesters held signs that included such messages as âFight for worldwide Intifadaâ and chanted familiar slogans like âGlobalize the Intifadaâ and âThere is only one solution; Intifada, revolution.âÂ 

Â 

Multiple student groups â including at The New School, New York University and Emerson CollegeÂ  â advertised their encampments using inverted red triangle imagery. This symbol first gained widespread use early in the Israel-Hamas war as a way to signify, in some cases, support for violent Palestinian so-called âresistanceâ against Israel. It first appeared in propaganda videos promoted by the al-Qassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, which showed footage of Hamas terrorists attacking Israeli military targets while superimposing inverted red triangles over the heads of Israeli soldiers or other targets.Â 

Graphics circulated by student groups advertising the encampments at New York University (left) and The New School (right) utilized inverted red triangle imagery.Â 

Â 

On a Telegram channel where they provide updates on their protests, organizers of the NYU encampment encouraged their followers to join the âResistance News Networkâ channel, an antisemitic encrypted news channel that shares violent anti-Israel imagery and promotes Hamas propaganda.

Vilification and Calls for the Exclusion of ZionistsÂ 

Â 

Some of the protest slogans at the encampments have included calls to destroy Zionism and to hound Zionists. The overwhelming majority of Jews identify in some way with Zionism or with Israel, and such statements are essentially calls for the exclusion of Jews. At Columbia on April 17, a protester told the crowd: âWe will never let up and we will never let down until Palestine is free, Zionism is destroyed, and Zionists start to hide like the Nazis.âÂ Â 

Â 

Protesters also chanted slogans that demonized Zionists and Zionism, including: âSay it loud, say it clear; we donât want no Zionists hereâ and âFree our prisoners, free them all; Zionism will fall.âÂ Â 

Â 

On April 21, anti-Zionist slogans included: âZionists, youâre a liar; you set Palestine on fireâ and âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine is all youâll see.â In other footage from Columbia, protesters could be heard calling Jewish students âYehudimâ (Hebrew for âJewsâ) and telling them, âGo back to Poland.âÂ 

Â 

Students at Ohio State University held an emergency protest on April 20 in direct response to the Columbia encampment, with the announcement for their protest stating, âSupport of the courageous student activists of the Gaza Solidarity Encampmentsâ¦We stand firmly in solidarity with these student activists and amplify their demands to their university.âÂ Â 

Â 

At the Ohio State protest, demonstrators marched through campus chanting, âHey hey, ho ho; the Zionists have got to go.â",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-and-strategies/disruptions-and-encampments-campus,"University Presidents and Campus Leaders:

Over the past six months, since Hamasâs terrorist attack on Israel, we have seen an unprecedented spike in antisemitism on our college campuses â more than 900 incidents last year, a 321% increase relative to the year prior. Now, some schools are facing a full-blown crisis.

At Columbia, students have set up and maintained an unauthorized âGaza Solidarity Encampmentâ on the South Lawn, persisting even after law enforcement arrested more than 100 students who had refused to leave. Since then, the school has struggled to maintain order. Video footage has emerged of masked protesters shouting, from outside the campus gates, âGo back to Polandâ and â[October 7th] will happen not one more time, not five more times, not 10 more times, not 100 more times, not 1,000 more times, but 10,000 times!âÂ  Another video shows a small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators chanting, âF**k Israel. Israel is a b*tch,â while waving the Palestinian flag. There are reports of protesters trying to burn a Columbia studentâs Israeli flag; Jewish students being splashed with liquid; and at least one individual holding a sign pointing to Jewish students that read âAl-Qassam's next targets,â a reference to Hamas. These acts and others like them have been roundly condemned by Columbiaâs President as âintimidating and harassing behavior.â

Instead of condemning and distancing themselves from this rhetoric and conduct, national Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) has instead called on members to âtake back our universityâ in order to show support for âcomradesâ on Columbiaâs campus and elsewhere â calling their efforts supportive of a âPopular University For Gaza.âÂ Now, at least 10 schools are confronting student-led encampments on their own campuses, with student groups at other schools announcing similar planned disruptions, including walkouts and protests in the days to come.

At Columbia, the campus being taken hostage by anti-Zionist fervor has effectively pushed the school to a breaking point. Students were discouraged from coming to campus today, and all classes were made remote in an effort to âdeescalate the rancorâ and allow the school to âconsider next steps.âÂ While perhaps necessary, these actions only underscore the severity of the underlying antisemitism crisis, not just at Columbia, but on campuses across the country, and the risk that absent clear, decisive action by campus leadership, the campus climate may worsen for all members of the campus community.

As ADL has been urging for months, when students violate campus policies or the law, there must be clear and immediate consequences. Members of the campus community must understand that while speech may be protected on campus, violations of time, place and manner restrictions â restrictions that are often necessary to ensure campus safety â are not. And while speech critical of Israel and supportive of the Palestinian cause is protected, threats, intimidation and harassment are not. Schools must be able to ensure adherence to their own rules, including through clear communication and robust and consistent enforcement of their own policies.

We implore you to take steps now to prevent further escalation.Â First, ensure close coordination with your security and law enforcement teams.Â  Law enforcement must be prepared to take action when conduct becomes criminal in order to protect the safety of all students. Second, ensure that there are clear consequences when conduct on campus violates school policies â especially in the form of threats and harassment by students who are intentionally concealing their identities for that purpose. Third, review and shore up your policies and protocols now to mitigate against the risk of students interfering with the rights of others on campus â whether through disruption ofÂ commencement ceremonies and other celebratory events, or by interfering with the ability of students to study for and take their end-of-year exams. Finally, campus presidents must use their voice. Jewish students need to hear you condemn antisemitic acts to make them feel safe, and the entire campus community must hear loud and clear that such language and/or acts do not fit with the values of the university.Â  Campus-based disruptions, and whether or not a school takes immediate action to address them, will continue to be taken into account and reflected in ADLâs Campus Antisemitism Report Card.

We hope you will join us in saying, âenough.âÂ  Antisemitism has been allowed to escalate for far too long, with far too few consequences.Â  We implore you to take decisive action now to protect students on your campus, and I hope you will see ADL as a resource.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/antisemitische-vorfalle-den-usa-stiegen-im-jahr-2023-um-140-prozent-und,"Massiver Anstieg nach dem 7. Oktober; Campus-VorfÃ¤lle verdreifachten sich; Bombendrohungen gegen jÃ¼dische Einrichtungen stiegen um das Zehnfache

New York, NY, 16. April 2024 â¦ Die jÃ¼dische Gemeinde in den USA erlebte im vergangenen Jahr einen beispiellosen Anstieg antisemitischer VorfÃ¤lle, der die Zahl aller antisemitischen VorfÃ¤lle in den letzten 45 Jahren bei weitem Ã¼bertraf. Dies ist teilweise auf die massive Zunahme antisemitischer Reaktionen auf das Massaker vom 7. Oktober in Israel und den andauernden Krieg in Gaza zurÃ¼ckzufÃ¼hren.

Die ADL (die Anti-Defamation League [Anti-Diffamierungs-Liga]) hat heute die endgÃ¼ltige Statistik fÃ¼r antisemitische VorfÃ¤lle im Jahr 2023 verÃ¶ffentlicht. Demnach gab es landesweit insgesamt 8.873 VorfÃ¤lle von Ãbergriffen, BelÃ¤stigungen und Vandalismus. Insgesamt entspricht dies einem Anstieg um 140 ProzentÂ gegenÃ¼ber 2022 - einem Jahr, das bereits einen Rekord darstellt - und dem hÃ¶chsten Stand seit Beginn der Erfassung dieser Daten durch die ADL im Jahr 1979.

DasÂ ADL Audit of Antisemitic Incidents [eine Auswertung antisemitischer VorfÃ¤lle der ADL] verzeichnete auch einen dramatischen Anstieg von 5.204 antisemitischen Handlungen nach dem 7. Oktober, was globale Trends widerspiegelt, da jÃ¼dische Gemeinden weltweit als Reaktion auf das Massaker und den Konflikt mit verstÃ¤rkten Spannungen und Hass konfrontiert waren - auf dem Campus von Schulen und UniversitÃ¤ten, auf Ã¶ffentlichen PlÃ¤tzen und bei Anti-Israel-Demonstrationen. Mit diesen VorfÃ¤llen Ã¼bertraf die Gesamtzahl fÃ¼r die zwÃ¶lf Monate des Jahres 2023 die Gesamtzahl der letzten drei Jahre zusammen und lag im Durchschnitt bei etwa 24 antijÃ¼dischen VorfÃ¤llen pro Tag in den USA.

Aufgrund dieser neuen Erkenntnisse forderte die ADL heute die US Gouverneur:innene im ganzen Land dazu auf, auf US-Bundesstaatenebene ihre eigenen Versionen der bahnbrechenden National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism des WeiÃen Hauses [landesweite Strategie zur BekÃ¤mpfung von Antisemitismus] auszuarbeiten - der ersten umfassenden Anstrengung dieser Art, um Antisemitismus Ã¼ber das gesamte politische Spektrum hinweg zu bekÃ¤mpfen.

âAntisemitismus ist nichts weniger als ein nationaler Notstand, ein Brand der Alarmstufe fÃ¼nf, der immer noch im ganzen Land und in unseren lokalen Gemeinden und UniversitÃ¤ten wÃ¼tetâ, so Jonathan Greenblatt, der CEO der ADL. âJÃ¼dische Amerikaner:innen werden in der Schule, bei der Arbeit, auf der StraÃe, in jÃ¼dischen Einrichtungen und sogar zu Hause wegen ihrer IdentitÃ¤t zur Zielscheibe gemacht. Diese Krise erfordert sofortiges Handeln in allen Bereichen der Gesellschaft und in allen US-Bundesstaaten. Jede:r Gouverneur:in muss eine umfassende Strategie zur BekÃ¤mpfung des Antisemitismus entwickeln und umsetzen, so wie es die Regierung auf nationaler Ebene getan hat.â

Nach Angaben des ADL Center on Extremism, das die Audit-Forschung und -Datenerhebung leitet, haben die VorfÃ¤lle in allen drei Kategorien zugenommen: Die Zahl der BelÃ¤stigungen stieg im Vergleich zu 2022 um 184 Prozent, VandalismusvorfÃ¤lle erhÃ¶hten sich um 69 Prozent und kÃ¶rperliche Ãbergriffe um 45 Prozent. Â 

Wichtige ErgebnisseÂ 

Im Jahr 2023 zÃ¤hlte die ADL antisemitische VorfÃ¤lle in allen 50 US-Bundesstaaten und im District of Columbia. Bei der Audit werden die VorfÃ¤lle in drei Kategorien eingeteilt:Â 

Ãbergriffe: 161 VorfÃ¤lle wurden als Ãbergriffe kategorisiert, d. h. als FÃ¤lle, in denen jÃ¼dische Personen (oder Personen, die als jÃ¼disch wahrgenommen werden) mit physischer Gewalt angegriffen wurden, begleitet von Hinweisen auf antisemitische AnimositÃ¤t.Â Im Vergleich zu 2022 war dies ein Anstieg von 45 Prozent. Bei den meisten antisemitischen Ãbergriffen (141 von 161) kam keine tÃ¶dliche Waffe zum Einsatz. Auf orthodoxe JÃ¼dinnen und Juden entfielen landesweit 34 Prozent der tÃ¤tlichen Angriffe. Die 161 Ãbergriffe betrafen 196 Opfer, von denen keines zu Tode kam.Â 
Â 
BelÃ¤stigungen: 6.535 VorfÃ¤lle wurden als BelÃ¤stigung eingestuft, bei denen jÃ¼dische Personen (oder Personen, die als jÃ¼disch wahrgenommen werden) mit antisemitischen Beleidigungen, Stereotypen oder VerschwÃ¶rungstheorien belÃ¤stigt wurden. BelÃ¤stigungen haben sich um 184 Prozent erhÃ¶ht - von 2.298 VorfÃ¤llen im Jahr 2022.Â 
Â 
Vandalismus: 2.177 VorfÃ¤lle wurden als Vandalismus eingestuft â also FÃ¤lle, bei denen es zu SachschÃ¤den kam und Beweise fÃ¼r eine antisemitische Absicht vorlagen oder die eine antisemitische Wirkung auf Juden hatten. Antisemitischer Vandalismus stieg um 69 ProzentÂ gegenÃ¼ber den 1.289 im Jahr 2022 gemeldeten FÃ¤llen. Bei 1.117 dieser FÃ¤lle waren Hakenkreuze vorhanden, die allgemein als Symbole von Judenhass interpretiert werden â ein Anstieg von 41 Prozent gegenÃ¼ber dem Vorjahr.

1.987 VorfÃ¤lle richteten sich gegen jÃ¼dische Einrichtungen, wie Synagogen, jÃ¼dische Gemeindezentren und jÃ¼dische Schulen â ein Anstieg von 237 Prozent von 589 im Jahr 2022. Dieser signifikante Anstieg ist zum Teil auf die dramatische Zunahme antisemitischer Bombendrohungen zurÃ¼ckzufÃ¼hren, von denen die Ã¼berwiegende Mehrheit im Herbst Synagogen betraf. Insgesamt waren Synagogen im Jahr 2023 von 73 Prozent aller VorfÃ¤lle betroffen, die auf jÃ¼dische Einrichtungen abzielten.

Antisemitische AktivitÃ¤ten, die auf dem Campus von Colleges und UniversitÃ¤ten gemeldet wurden, nahmen gegenÃ¼ber 2022 um 321 Prozent zu. An nicht-jÃ¼dischen Schulen [Kindergarten bis 12. Schuljahr] wurden 1.162 VorfÃ¤lle gemeldet - ein Anstieg von 135 Prozent.Â 

Die Staaten mit der hÃ¶chsten Anzahl an VorfÃ¤llen waren Kalifornien (1.266), New York (1.218), New Jersey (830), Florida (463) und Massachusetts (440). Auf diese fÃ¼nf Staaten zusammen entfielen 48 Prozent aller VorfÃ¤lle.

âTrotz dieser beispiellosen Herausforderungen dÃ¼rfen die amerikanischen JÃ¼dinnen und Juden der Angst nicht die Oberhand gebenâ, sagte Greenblatt. âSelbst wÃ¤hrend wir die GeiÃel des Antisemitismus bekÃ¤mpfen, sollten wir stolz auf unsere jÃ¼dische IdentitÃ¤t sein und selbstbewusst unseren Platz in der amerikanischen Gesellschaft einnehmen. Wir haben weit mehr VerbÃ¼ndete als Feinde, auch wenn sich dies momentan vielleicht nicht so anfÃ¼hlt. Und wir appellieren an alle philanthropischen Menschen, sich mit ihren jÃ¼dischen Freund:innen und Nachbar solidarisch zu erklÃ¤ren. Wir brauchen Ihre UnterstÃ¼tzung und Ihren Beistand.â

Propaganda der weiÃen VorherrschaftÂ 

Der Bericht stellt auch eine Zunahme der AktivitÃ¤ten organisierter, der White Supremacy zugehÃ¶rigen Gruppen fest, die im vergangenen Jahr fÃ¼r 1.160 FÃ¤lle antisemitischer Propagandaverbreitung verantwortlich waren - ein Anstieg gegenÃ¼ber den 852 PropagandavorfÃ¤llen, die im Jahr 2022 weiÃen suprematistischen Gruppen zugeschrieben wurden.Â 

Bombendrohungen und SwattingÂ 

Bombendrohungen gegen jÃ¼dische Einrichtungen haben drastisch zugenommen â insgesamt wurden mit 1.009 Bombendrohungen die hÃ¶chste jemals verzeichnete Zahl und damit eine ErhÃ¶hung um mehr als 1.000 Prozent von 91 im Jahr 2022 gemeldet.Â  Â 

DarÃ¼ber hinaus wurde SwattingÂ zunehmend als Taktik verwendet, um Minderheiten einzuschÃ¼chtern und zu belÃ¤stigen, wobei 101-Swatting-VorfÃ¤lle auf jÃ¼dische Einrichtungen gerichtet waren.Â 

âDiese enorme Anzahl an VorfÃ¤llen, die wir 2023 dokumentiert haben, nahm viele Formen an, einschlieÃlich Bombendrohungen und Swatting-Kampagnen, die alle mit dem Ziel durchgefÃ¼hrt wurden, die Community zu terrorisieren, indem sie Gottesdienste und AktivitÃ¤ten in Synagogen und anderen jÃ¼dischen Einrichtungen im ganzen Land stÃ¶rtenâ, so Oren Segal, Vice President des ADL Center on Extremism. âUnsere Verfolgung eines Swatting-Netzwerks ermÃ¶glichte es der ADL, den StrafverfolgungsbehÃ¶rden wichtige Informationen zur VerfÃ¼gung zu stellen, um die TÃ¤ter:innen zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen. Gleichzeitig konnten die Zielgruppen prÃ¤ventiv gewarnt und potenzieller Schaden gemindert werden.â

Antizionismus und ZwischenfÃ¤lle bei Anti-Israel-ProtestenÂ Â 

Von den 8.873 VorfÃ¤llen im Jahr 2023 wiesen 3.162 (36 Prozent der Gesamtzahl) speziell Elemente auf, die sich auf Israel oder den Zionismus bezogen. Dies ist wesentlich hÃ¶her als die im Jahr 2022 gemeldeten 241 VorfÃ¤lle, die 6,5 Prozent der VorfÃ¤lle insgesamt ausmachten. Â 

Israelbezogene antisemitische VorfÃ¤lle fanden zumeist in Ã¶ffentlichen Bereichen statt â 1.540 VorfÃ¤lle ereigneten sich an Orten wie BÃ¼chereien, in Ã¶ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln und auf der StraÃe. Weitere 644 israelbezogene VorfÃ¤lle fanden auf dem Campus von Colleges und UniversitÃ¤ten statt. JÃ¼dische Einrichtungen waren in 377 FÃ¤llen Ziel israelbezogener VorfÃ¤lle und 156 israelbezogene VorfÃ¤lle ereigneten sich in Schulen. Â 

Unmittelbar nach dem 7. Oktober begannen viele anti-israelische Organisationen Proteste und Kampagnen in allen Teilen der Vereinigten Staaten, die sich bis Ende 2023 fortsetzten. Zu der bei diesen Kundgebungen verwendeten Rhetorik gehÃ¶rte unter anderem die FÃ¶rderung klassischer antisemitischer Tropen, die Gleichsetzung des Judentums oder des Zionismus mit dem Nationalsozialismus, die unverblÃ¼mte UnterstÃ¼tzung von Terrorismus, die Verherrlichung terroristischer Gruppen und des extremen Antizionismus. Â 

MethodikÂ 

In der ADL Audit sind strafbare und nicht strafbare Handlungen der BelÃ¤stigung und EinschÃ¼chterung enthalten, wie unter anderem die Verbreitung von Hasspropaganda, Drohungen und Beschimpfungen sowie Vandalismus und Ãbergriffe. Das Audit wurde aufgrund von Informationen von Opfern, StrafverfolgungsbehÃ¶rden und fÃ¼hrenden Personen in der Community zusammengestellt und von Fachleuten der ADL ausgewertet. Dadurch ergibt sich eine regelmÃ¤Ãige Momentaufnahme eines bestimmten Aspekts der jÃ¼disch-amerikanischen Erfahrung, wÃ¤hrend durch die gemeldeten AktivitÃ¤ten gleichzeitig mÃ¶gliche Trends identifiziert werden.

Die Zahlen des ADL-Audit 2023 enthalten 1.350 VorfÃ¤lle, die aufgrund einer Aktualisierung der Methodik nach dem 7. Oktober berÃ¼cksichtigt wurden (siehe Methodology in the Audit [Methodik beim Audit]). Ohne die im Rahmen der Methodenaktualisierung einbezogenen VorfÃ¤lle hat die ADL 7.523 VorfÃ¤lle erfasst, was einem Anstieg der antisemitischen VorfÃ¤lle um 103 Prozent gegenÃ¼ber der Gesamtzahl der VorfÃ¤lle im Jahr 2022 entspricht. Â 

Der vollstÃ¤ndige Datensatz zu antisemitischen VorfÃ¤llen fÃ¼r die Jahre 2016 bis 2023 kann auf der H.E.A.T. Map von ADL aufgerufen werden. Dies ist ein interaktives Online-Tool, wodurch Nutzer antisemitische VorfÃ¤lle und extremistische AktivitÃ¤ten geografisch darstellen kÃ¶nnen. Â 

Das Audit ist eine Momentaufnahme der Art und Weise, auf die amerikanische Juden mit Antisemitismus konfrontiert werden. FÃ¼r ein volles VerstÃ¤ndnis des Antisemitismus in den USA bedarf es jedoch auch anderer Analyseformen, wie Ã¶ffentlicher Meinungsforschung, der Auswertung von Online-Antisemitismus und Untersuchungen extremistischer AktivitÃ¤ten, die in anderen Berichten der ADL enthalten sind, wie derÂ ADL Survey of Antisemitic Attitudes in America 2024, Campus Antisemitism: A Study of Campus Climate Before and After the Hamas Terrorist Attacks, ADL Global 100, Online Hate and Harassment: The American Experience,Â Murder and Extremism undÂ White Supremacist Propaganda.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/vitriolic-reactions-arouris-killing-highlight-his-importance-iranian-regimes-axis,"The death of Saleh Al-Arouri, a leading Hamas financier and military leader on January 2, 2024, resulted in threats of retribution against Israel by Hamas, Hezbollah and other regional proxies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Similar to the killing of Qassim Soleimani, the head of Quds Force, in 2020 in Baghdad, and the killing of Seyed Razi Mousavi, a senior adviser of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps â Quds Force (IRGC-QF), in 2022 in Syria, Al-Arouri's death led to vitriol and incitement against the Jewish state.Â Â 

Â 

Al-Arouri was both a driver of Hamasâ growing capabilities and ambitions as an armed group and a key broker of its deepening alliance with Tehranâs network of regional terrorist proxies.Â 

Â 

The strength of the reaction to Al-Arouriâs death is a testament to his importance to the so-called âaxis of resistanceâ â a network of Tehran-backed Islamist terror groups in Gaza and the West Bank, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, which have united under Iranian regime support with the common aim of destroying Israel and striking Jewish targets.Â

In a speech on January 3, General Esmail Qaani, IRGC Qods Force commander, mentioned the killing of Arouri along with that of the IRGC commander in Syria, Sayyed Razi Moussavi, stating that it âshow[s] the extent of the enemy's desperation.â He continued that despite Arouriâs death, the âIslamic Republic [of Iran] will not give up on the methodology of uprooting the Zionist regime.âÂ Â 

Â 

Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Reza Ashtiani also threatened the United States over Arouriâs death, stating that ""The consequences of this terror will be felt by [the US].""Â Â 

Â 

Blaming Al-Arouriâs death on Israel, Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamasâ political bureau, called the killing a âcowardlyâ and âbarbaric aggressionâ as well as âan atrocious crimeâ by âthe Zionist enemy.â Haniyeh went on to threaten that âthe Nazi Zionist occupation bears the responsibility for its consequences.â Referring to the fact that Al-Arouri died in Lebanon, Haniyeh called the killing a âcomplete terrorist act and a violation of Lebanonâs sovereignty.âÂ Â 

Â 

Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, called Al-Arouri a âfriend and confidant,â and threatened that Al-Arouriâs death would ânot go unpunished.â Kataâib Hezbollah, an Iranian regime proxy in Iraq, called the killing a âgutless treacherous action.â The Houthis of Yemen, another Iranian regime proxy, promised that the killing would strengthen their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.Â Â 

Â 

Â 

A Life Committed to Terrorist Violence Against Jews and IsraelÂ 

Â 

Al-Arouriâs talents in terrorist financing and acquiring weapons played a key role in developing Hamasâ armed wing, the Izzedin Qassam Brigades. He was also responsible for financing and organizing terrorist cells in the West Bank, which, under his supervision, began to specialize in kidnapping Israelis. Among the most notorious of these was the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in 2014. Al-Arouri was later filmed admitting and celebrating Hamasâ responsibility for the murders.Â Â Â 

Â 

In 2009, while outwardly claiming to accept US efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israel conflict, Hamas began internally promoting some of its most militant and violent members to its leadership council. Among them was Saleh Al-Arouri.Â Â Â 

Â 

Under the threat of arrest, Al-Arouri left the West Bank for Syria in 2010, where he organized the transfer of funds to the families of Hamas terrorists.Â Â 

Â 

Later, while living openly in Turkey, Al-Arouri oversaw Hamasâ expansion and activities in the West Bank. Since Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organization, Al-Arouri used his time there to transfer funds and weapons to Hamas cells in Jordan and the West Bank, including the Qassam Brigades. This was an essential boon for Hamas at the time, since other international sources of finance â for example from networks in the United States â had become restricted by increasing law enforcement clampdowns.Â Â 

Â 

Following reconciliation talks between Turkey and Israel, as well as US pressure, Al-Arouri was expelled from Turkey in 2015 and moved to Qatar. The same year, he was named by the US Treasury as a Specially Designated International Terrorist for his role in financing and directing Hamas terror cells in the West Bank and Jordan, and facilitating the transfer of funds to Hamas more widely, including the Qassam Brigades.Â Â 

Â 

During the Gulf diplomatic crisis of 2017 in which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain accused Qatar of harboring and supporting Islamist terrorists, Al-Arouri was expelled from Qatar and settled in the Dahiya neighborhood of Beirut â a Hezbollah stronghold.Â Â Â 

Â 

From his new base in Lebanon, Al-Arouri continued his rise within Hamas, being promoted in 2017 to deputy head of Hamasâ political bureau. In this new role, Arouri helped Hamas to develop increasingly close political ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Hezbollah, which had become strained due to Hamasâ refusal to support the Syrian regime against Sunni Islamist groups in the countryâs civil war.Â Â Â 

Â 

In October 2017, Al-Arouri headed a Hamas delegation to Tehran, during which he acknowledged that the Islamic Republic of Iran was Hamasâ primary supporter âin all areasâ and that he hoped this support would continue âuntil the defeat of the occupationâ (i.e. the destruction of Israel). In November, 2017, he met with Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, to discuss the IDFâs recent destruction of a Hamas tunnel.Â Â Â 

Â 

As well as working to embed Hamas more deeply within the Islamic Republicâs âaxis of resistanceâ proxy network, Al-Arouri (who had previously plotted to overthrow Fatah in the West Bank) was also involved in talks brokered by Egypt to reconcile Hamas and Fatah. However, the head of the Shin Bet warned that this was simply the precursor for Hamas to mount another overthrow attempt. Despite this, and his exile in Lebanon, Al-Arouri continued to serve as leader of Hamas in the West Bank, where he maintained his role in financing, encouraging and overseeing terror attacks.Â Â 

Â 

In the leadup to October 7, Al-Arouri made statements which make it clear that his ambition was to escalate Hamasâ conflict with Israel significantly, with the aim of destabilizing Israeli society as a whole. In an interview with a Lebanese TV channel in August 2023, he said that Hamas wants âtotal war with Israel,â stressing that Hamas would use âunconventional warfareâ in a war that he anticipated would shut down Israelâs âairspace, seaports, electricity, water supply, and communications.âÂ Â 

Â 

His death not only weakened Hamas, but was a major setback for the network of Tehran-backed terrorist groups that includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, Kataâib Hezbollah in Iraq, and the Houthis of Yemen.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/us-antisemitic-incidents-soared-140-percent-2023-breaking-all-previous,"New York, NY, April 16, 2024 â¦ Driven in part by a massive spike in antisemitic reactions to the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza, the U.S. Jewish community last year experienced an unprecedented increase in antisemitic incidents, far exceeding any other annual tally in the past 45 years.

ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today released the final statistics for antisemitic incidents in 2023, reporting a total of 8,873 incidents of assault, harassment, and vandalism across the country. The total represents a 140-percent increaseÂ from 2022 â already a record-setting year â and the highest level recorded since ADL started tracking this data in 1979.

The ADL Audit of Antisemitic Incidents also recorded a dramatic spike of 5,204 antisemitic acts post-Oct. 7, reflecting global trends as Jewish communities worldwide faced heightened tensions and hatred in response to the massacre and conflict â on campuses, in the public square and at anti-Israel demonstrations. With those incidents, the 12-month total for 2023 surpassed the totals of all the past three years combined and averaged about 24 anti-Jewish incidents in the U.S. per day.

In response to the new findings, ADL today called on governorâs offices across the country to create their own state-level versions of the White Houseâs landmarkÂ National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, the first of its kind, comprehensive effort to address antisemitism from across the political spectrum.

âAntisemitism is nothing short of a national emergency, a five-alarm fire that is still ragingÂ across the country and in our local communities and campuses,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âJewish Americans are being targeted for who they are at school, at work, on the street, in Jewish institutions and even at home. This crisis demands immediate action from every sector of society and every state in the union. We need every governor to develop and put in place a comprehensive strategy to fight antisemitism, just as the administration has done at the national level.â

According to the ADL Center on Extremism, which leads Audit research and data collection, incidents increased in all three categories: Incidents of harassment surged by 184 percent compared to 2022; acts of vandalism rose 69 percent; and physical assaults jumped 45 percent.

Major Findings

In 2023, ADL counted antisemitic incidents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Audit classifies incidents into three categories:

Assaults: 161 incidents were categorized as assault, defined as cases where Jewish people (or people perceived to be Jewish) were targeted with physical violence accompanied by evidence of antisemitic animus. This was a 45 percent increase compared to 2022. Most antisemitic assaults (141 out of 161) were perpetrated without the use of a deadly weapon. Orthodox Jews were targeted in 34 percent of assault incidents nationally. The 161 incidents of assault targeted 196 victims, none of which were fatal.Â 
Â 
Harassment: 6,535 incidents were categorized as harassment, defined as cases where one or more Jewish people (or people perceived to be Jewish) were harassed with antisemitic slurs, stereotypes or conspiracy theories. Acts of harassment increased 184 percent, up from 2,298 incidents in 2022.
Â 
Vandalism: 2,177 incidents were categorized as vandalism, defined as cases where property was damaged along with evidence of antisemitic intent or had an antisemitic impact on Jews. Acts of antisemitic vandalism increased 69 percent from the 1,289 incidents reported in 2022. Swastikas, which are generally interpreted as symbols of antisemitic hatred, were present in 1,117 of these incidents, up 41 percent from last year.

There were 1,987 incidents targeting Jewish institutions such as synagogues, Jewish community centers and Jewish schools, an increase of 237 percent from 589 in 2022. This significant increase was in part due to the dramatic spike in antisemitic bomb threats, the vast majority of which targeted synagogues in the fall. In total, synagogues experienced 73 percent of all incidents affecting Jewish institutions in 2023.

Antisemitic activity reported on college and university campuses increased by 321 percentÂ from 2022. In non-Jewish K-12 schools, 1,162 incidents were reported, an increase of 135 percent.Â 

The states with the highest number of incidents were California (1,266), New York (1,218), New Jersey (830), Florida (463) and Massachusetts (440). Combined, these five states accounted for 48 percent of the total incidents.

âDespite these unprecedented challenges, American Jews must not give in to fear,â Greenblatt said. âEven while we fight the scourge of antisemitism, we should be proud of our Jewish identities and confident of our place in American society. It may not feel so right now, but we have many more allies than enemies. And we call on all people of good will to stand with their Jewish friends and neighbors. We need your support and your allyship.â

White Supremacist Propaganda

The report also found an increase in activity by organized white supremacist groups, who were responsible for 1,160 antisemitic propaganda distributions last year â an increase from the 852 propaganda incidents attributed to white supremacist groups in 2022.

Bomb Threats and Swatting

Bomb threats toward Jewish institutions increased dramatically, with a total of 1,009 bomb threats â the highest number ever recorded and an increase of over 1,000 percent from 91 in 2022.Â 

Additionally,Â swattingÂ was increasingly used as a tactic to intimidate and harass minority communities, with 104 swatting incidents targeting Jewish institutions.

âThe massive volume of incidents we documented in 2023 took many forms, including bomb threats and swatting campaigns, all aimed at terrorizing the community by disrupting services and activities at synagogues and other Jewish institutions across the country,â said Oren Segal, Vice President of the ADL Center on Extremism. âOur tracking of a swatting network, enabled ADL to offer crucial intelligence to law enforcement, ensuring accountability for perpetrators, while also preemptively alerting targeted communities and mitigating potential harm.â

Anti-Zionism andÂ Incidents at Anti-Israel Protests

Of the 8,873 incidents in 2023, 3,162 (36 percent of the total) specifically contained elements referencing Israel or Zionism. This is significantly higher than the 241 incidents reported in 2022, which accounted for 6.5 percent of the total incidents.Â 

Israel-related antisemitic incidents most often took place in public areas, with 1,540 incidents in locations like libraries, public transportation and on the streets. Another 644 Israel-related incidents took place on college and university campuses. Jewish institutions were targeted in Israel-related incidents on 377 occasions and 156 Israel-related incidents took place at K-12 schools.

Beginning immediately after Oct. 7, many anti-Israel organizations began protests and campaigns across the United States that continued through the end of 2023. The rhetoric used at these rallies included the promotion of classic antisemitic tropes, signage equating Judaism or Zionism with Nazism, unapologetic support for terrorism, glorification of terrorist groups and extreme anti-Zionism.Â 

Methodology

The ADL Audit includes both criminal and non-criminal acts of harassment and intimidation, including distribution of hate propaganda, threats and slurs, as well as vandalism and assault. Compiled using information provided by victims, law enforcement and community leaders, and evaluated by ADLâs professional staff, the Audit provides a regular snapshot of one specific aspect of the Jewish-American experience while identifying possible trends in the types of activity reported.

ADLâs 2023 Audit numbers contain 1,350 incidents included due to a post-October 7 methodology update (see Methodology in the Audit). Excluding incidents included under the methodology update, ADL tabulated 7,523 incidents, a 103-percent increase in antisemitic incidents from the incident total in 2022.

The complete dataset for antisemitic incidents for 2016-2023 is available on ADLâsÂ H.E.A.T. Map, an interactive online tool that allows users to geographically chart antisemitic incidents and extremist activity.Â 

The Audit offers a snapshot of one of the ways American Jews encounter antisemitism, but a full understanding of antisemitism in the U.S. requires other forms of analysis as well, including public opinion polling, assessments of online antisemitism and examinations of extremist activity, all of which ADL offers in other reports, such asÂ theÂ ADL Survey of Antisemitic Attitudes in America 2024,Â Campus Antisemitism: A Study of Campus Climate Before and After the Hamas Terrorist Attacks,Â ADL Global 100,Â Online Hate and Harassment: The American Experience,Â Murder and Extremism andÂ White Supremacist Propaganda.Â  Â 

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of antisemitism and bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adls-task-force-middle-east-minorities-condemns-islamic-republic-irans,"New York, NY, April 15, 2024... ADL's (Anti-Defamation League) Task Force on Middle East MinoritiesÂ condemns the Islamic Republic of Iranâs attack targeting Israel. This unprecedentedÂ attack not only is an unjustified act of war against Israel but also poses a great threat toÂ the region's stability.Â 
Â 
Reverend Johnnie Moore, member of ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities andÂ president of the Congress of Christian Leaders stated:Â 
Â 
âThe Ayatollahs abuse the name of God and use religion only as a weapon ofÂ terror. It is time for all people of faith to join their voices with the voices of theÂ Iranian people and say: âNot in our name!â Our political leaders need to recognizeÂ this for what it was: an unprecedented action by the Ayatollahs which needs to beÂ met with a joint reaction of the free world.âÂ 
Â 
ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities member, and a senior fellow at FoundationÂ for Defense of Democracies Behnam Ben Taleblu noted the contrast between the viewsÂ of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Iranian people:Â 
Â 
âIranâs leaders have shown that they will put their money where their mouth isÂ when they chant âDeath to Israel.â This was on full display on April 14 as theÂ Islamic Republic conducted a historic overt and direct strike from its territoryÂ against the Jewish state using drones and missiles. This attack could have killedÂ thousands in a land sacred to the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faiths. TehranâsÂ escalation was not driven by some form of domestic pressure. After all, IraniansÂ have been chanting âNot Gaza, Not Lebanon, My Life Only for Iranâ in streetÂ protests since 2009. It was instead born of the clerical regimeâs deeply unpopularÂ anti-Israel ideology and revolutionarily foreign policy.â Â 
Â 
Marjan Keypour, ADLâs Task Force on Middle East Minorities member and director ofÂ Alliance for Rights of All Minorities (ARAM), underscored:Â 
Â 
âTime and again, the people of Iran have rejected the enmity toward Israel that isÂ forced upon them. We join the people of Iran and all those affected by theseÂ hateful attacks in rejecting hate and division among all people regardless ofÂ religion and belief and recommit ourselves to promoting peace and coexistenceÂ among all people.â",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-calls-wall-street-reject-bds-proposal-rtx-maker-iron-dome-amid-recent,"New York, NY, April 15, 2024Â âÂ In response to Sundayâs unprecedented aerial attack by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on Israel, which involved over 300 drones and missiles,Â ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today urges shareholders to voteÂ againstÂ Proposal 7 outlined in the RTXâs 2024 Proxy Statement. RTX Corporation, the worldâs largest aerospace and defense company, is a producer of the Iron Dome defense system through a joint venture,Â Raytheon Rafael Area Protection Systems (R2S).Â Â 

âThis shareholder proposal is not only false and misleading but also seeks to deprive Israel of essential defensive tools, including the Iron Dome system, which was crucial in defendingÂ civiliansÂ during Sundayâs attack,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO.Â âAt a time when Israel is facing an existential threatfrom Iran and its terror proxies, shareholders of good conscience must reject the hateful anti-Israel rhetoric propagated by theÂ Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.âÂ 

In March, ADL affiliate JLens filed aÂ Notice of Exempt Solicitation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, opposing Proposal 7 in RTX's 2024 proxy statement. The notice was submitted because the proposal containsÂ languagethat could embolden hostility directed against Jews in the United States and beyond, including allegations that Raytheon's arms sales to Israel are âused to maintain the system of apartheid.âÂ 

âAntisemitism does not belong in corporate proxy statements,â said JLens Managing Director Ari Hoffnung. âWords matter, and we urge shareholders to join us in rejecting hateful rhetoric and supporting Israelâs right to exist by voting AGAINST Proposal 7.â

The J7 expresses its unwavering support for Israel and the Israeli people, and unequivocally condemns the Islamic Republic of Iran for launching this unprecedented assault against the Jewish state.Â We are immensely grateful to the governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United States, and Arab states that assisted Israeli forces in intercepting this attack, as well as to those who expressed solidarity with the Jewish State.

The firing by the Iranian regime of hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic weapons is a wholly unjustified act of war, and is further proof of the regimeâs long-held and hate-filled desire to eradicate Israel and kill as many Jews as possible.

We strongly support Israel in its efforts to defend itself against continued threats to its sovereignty posed by the Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others.

Now is the time for our countries, and the international community as a whole, to designate the regime-sponsored Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in its entirety as a terrorist entity for their continuing violent threats to the region and beyond.

The international community must stand strongly in support of Israel and do everything in its power to counter the danger posed by the Iranian regime to the region and international stability.Â  Â 

The J7, the Large Communitiesâ Task Force Against Antisemitism, was formed in response to increasing rates of antisemitism around the world and comprises major Jewish organizations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Argentina and Australia.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/anti-israel-activists-support-iran-attack-israel,"In response to Iranâs unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel on April 13, several anti-Zionist organizations and activists in the U.S. have praised Iran for its actions, alleging that authentic supporters of Palestine must support the attack.

This rhetoric is reminiscent of the language and messages expressed by some anti-Zionist activists in the aftermath of the October 7 massacre by Hamas, where the violence against Israelis was immediately glorified and justified by more radical elements.Â 

Perhaps the most notable such immediate reaction to the Iran attack occurred at a conference held by the March on the DNC coalition, cosponsored by Chicago SJP, the Palestinian Feminist Collective, US Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), Students for a Democratic Society at UIC and others. As news of the attack broke, more than a hundred activists at the event appeared exuberant upon learning of Iranâs attack, cheering and chanting âhands off Iran!â
Â 

Â 

Also at the conference, Shabbir Rizvi, a Chicago-based writer for the Iranian regimeâs PressTV, was filmed teaching attendees how to chant ""Death to Israel"" and ""Death to America"" in Persian. After the attack on Israel, he replied to a tweet from Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi defending hisÂ countryâsÂ actions: âGod bless Iran and the heroes of the IRGC.â

Â 

Other notable groups and individuals who have expressed support for Iranâs unprecedented attack include an affiliate of Students for Justice in Palestine; an official on the International Committee of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA); Professor Asad Abukhalil (CSU Stanislaus); and Mohammed Habbeh, National Development Coordinator for American Muslims for Palestine (AMP).

On the same night as Iranâs attack on Israel, the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) applauded Iran who âdared to take action to bring an end to this genocide [against Gaza].â They presented Iranâs attack as an act of self-defense against Israel. âZionismâs ultimate ambitions as a project are escalation against and destruction of not only Palestine, but our region as a wholeâ¦.Iran has a right to defend itself.â The PYM is an anti-Zionist activist organization with chapters in the United States and Canada, which has played a role in convening many of the anti-Israel rallies since October 7. Drew SJP re-posted PYMâs statement on its Instagram account.

Although they did not applaud the attack, CAIR (the Council on American Islamic Relations) issued a statement which seemed to claim that Israel provoked Iranâs attack in order to distract attention from its alleged âgenocideâ in Gaza. âWe call on the Biden administration to reject the far-right Israeli governmentâs âtransparentâ attempt to distract from the #Gaza #genocide by dragging the U.S. into a regional war and instead demand that the Israeli government de-escalate the crisis it started. #Iran #Israel.âÂ 
Â 

Â 
Jewish Voice for Peace did not applaud Iranâs attack, but they perversely blamed Israel for âintentionally escalat[ing] regional instability,â and added that Israel and the U.S. are to blame for bringing âthe entire region to the precipice of an all-out war.â Their preferred solution is for the U.S. to âhalt weapons sales to Israel immediately and end all funding of the Israeli military.â

Hours after the attack, an account affiliated with fringe anti-Zionist ultra-Orthodox Jewish groupÂ Neturei KartaÂ tweeted: âG-d BLESS IRAN,â along with a photo of what appears to be one of their representatives speaking at a protest against a backdrop of the Hezbollah and Iranian flags.
Â 

Â 
The far-left International League of Peoplesâ Struggle (ILPS) issued a statement saying that Iranâs attack on Israel was merely a response to the âbloodthirsty killing frenzy and expansionist aggressionâ that drove Israel to bomb Iranâs Syrian embassy. According to the ILPS, Iranâs response was a form of âlegitimate defense,â and they called on supporters to prepare for âmass demonstrations is all possible regions to prevent U.S. war on Iran.â

Claiming that Iran was merely defending itself, the North Carolina Green Party played into an antisemitic trope about Jewish control and alleged that Congress is sympathetic to Israel because it has been âboughtâ by pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC: âIran has a right to defend itself. Or does that only apply to Israel against anyone they want to take land from? Eyes on every member of Congress that has been bought and paid for by AIPAC.â

Freedom Road Socialist Organization, which has had a presence at several anti-Israel rallies since October 7, released a statement urging the public to side with Iran: âIran has helped the Palestinian resistance, and we should stand with Iran just as we stand with Palestine.â

In response to a post from Wisconsin Congressman Mark Pocan, who called for an end to regional aggression in the Middle East, the anti-Zionist group Madison for Palestine cheered Iran for âretaliating against genocidal Zionistsâ and berated him for calling for de-escalation. âHOW DARE YOU demand the [Palestinian] resistance to stop defending themselves against this massacre.âÂ 

Hunter College Palestine Solidarity Alliance, an affiliate of SJP, reposted a report of a drone attack from the anti-Israel account Arabs of Canada and added: âtrue solidarity.â In another post, PSA Hunter College placed a laughing emoji over a clip of Israelis allegedly running into shelters during the Iranian attack.


Professor Asad Abukhalil of California State University at Stanislaus expressed his feelings of shame âthat Iran did what all Arabs could not doâ (via Google Translate).Â 


As news of the attack broke, Mirah Wood of Democratic Socialists of Americaâs Official International Committee expressed her âfull solidarity with Iran as it retaliates against the Zionist entity.â She also pleaded for the public to âsupport Palestinian resistance.âÂ 


Also in the midst of the attack, Nerdeen Kiswani, founder and leader of NYC-based vociferous anti-Zionist group Within Our Lifetime, called on her readers to âsupport the axis of resistanceâ (usually a reference to Iran and its proxies) in order âto support Palestine.â

As reports broke of Iran launching drones at Israel, Ali Abunimah, co-founder of anti-Zionist publication The Electronic Intifada, tweeted: âIf the reports are accurate we must hope that the Iranian self-defense drones will inflict precise and devastating blows at Zionist enemy terror bases and terror infrastructure and that there are enough of them to overwhelm terrorist air defenses.âÂ 

Mohamad Habehh, a national development coordinator for American Muslims for Palestine, stated in a post that âIran has the right to self-defense.âÂ Â 


Asa Winstanley, a journalist at Electronic Intifada, tweeted: âTHANK YOU IRAN.â",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/american-muslims-palestine-amp,"Key Points

American Muslims for Palestine is at the core of the anti-Israel and anti-Zionist movement in the United States.
AMPâs leadership frequently engages in rhetoric that promotes antisemitic tropes and support for violence against Israel, such as praising Hamas for the October 7, 2023 attack which marked the deadliest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust.
A current board member of AMP was implicated in Hamas activity in the 1990s, according to an FBI memorandum.
AMP has called for a boycott of mainstream Jewish organizations such as Jewish Federations and the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC).
AMP and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) have a long-standing association and partner for rallies and other events.

Introduction

American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) is at the core of the anti-Israel and anti-Zionist movement in the United States. Established in 2006 by University of California, Berkeley, lecturer (and current AMP National Board Chairman) Hatem Bazian, AMP is based in Chicago and has at least eight active chapters nationwide.

Throughout its nearly 20-year history, AMPâs national leaders, chapter leaders and individual activists have promulgated antisemitic conspiracy theories about Jewish control of the government and expressed admiration for U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) such asÂ Hamas and Hezbollah. Its leaders have also vilified Zionism and called for the ostracization of Zionists from public life. As most Jews considerÂ Zionism â or support for Israelâs existence in its ancestral homelandâ to be an aspect of their Jewish identities, such rhetoric is effectively an attack on the Jewish community.

The organization has been an active sponsor of theÂ anti-Israel protest movement and has avidly sought to delegitimize and demonize the Jewish state through various campaigns and organized actions over the years.

Following the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led massacre, AMP has helped organize and co-sponsor numerous anti-Israel protests, rallies and marches. Some AMP-sponsored anti-Israel rallies have featuredÂ flags of terrorist groups and the glorification of individual terrorists, such as Hamas spokesmanÂ Abu Obaida; speeches and posters that containedÂ antisemitic conspiracy theories about Zionist control of the U.S. government; and incidents of harassment towards Jewish people.

AMP's organizational roots lie with the now-defunct Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP), a group once described by the U.S. government as having âdisseminated information/propagandaâ for Hamas. Though IAP officially dissolved in 2004, many of its leaders have continued their activism with AMP, including Osama Abuirshaid, AMPâs current executive director, Nihad Awad, the executive director of theÂ Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Rafeeq Jaber, a former president of IAP who has spoken at AMP events, former AMP Executive Director Abdelbaset Hamayel who also previously served as IAP executive director and secretary general, Kifah Mustafa, formerly with IAP in Illinois and Raeed Tayeh, a former IAP member in Chicago.

History and Ideology

AMP was initially founded as a volunteer activist organization that provides anti-Zionist training and education to students and Muslim community organizations in the country. It later registered a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization through which to draw tax-deductible donations under the name Americans for Justice in Palestine (AJP) Educational Foundation Inc., which acts as AMPâs fiscal sponsor.

AMP focused much of its early years on student outreach at universities and colleges nationwide and has a long association with anti-Zionist campus organization Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which Bazian also helped establish in the 1990s.

AMP promotes extreme anti-Israel and anti-Zionist views and offers educational events that are open to the public, media and activism guidebooks, factsheets and reports on a variety of issues related to Israel and the Palestinian territories.

It has at times provided a platform for antisemitism under the guise of a stated primary goal to âeducate the public and media about Israelâs occupation of Palestine.â For example, a brochure still available on AMPâs website directs readers to the website of If Americans Knew, an antisemitic group led by Alison Weir.

In 2021, AMPâs New Jersey chapter held a protest that hosted Rich Siegel, a leader with the anti-Israel group Deir Yassin Remembered which has been marred by antisemitic rhetoric including the promotion of Holocaust denial. Siegel has aÂ history of problematic rhetoric and actions including aÂ protest outside a synagogue in Teaneck, NJ in May 2021.

For at least a decade, AMP has expressed a position that Israel is an apartheid state and a âsettler-colonialâ venture that should be boycotted. Its programs also often promote the view that Zionism is an inherently discriminatory ideology that must be opposed. The group does not take a position on a two-state solution to the conflict and strongly supports and promotes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.

Over the years, AMP has grown its influence.Â In 2015, it launched its first-ever Palestine Advocacy Days, during which members spent several days in advocacy training and meetings with members of Congress, a sign of the groupâs increasing organizing capabilities.

AMP events also periodically feature political leaders, including members of Congress such as U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Rep. Betty McCollum and Rep. Andre Carson.

In 2021, AMP set up an affiliate 501(c)(4) organization, Americans for Justice in Palestine Action (AJP Action), to take over the Palestine Advocacy Days events, and further expand its lobbying capabilities and political pull.

AMP and SJP

Through Bazianâs involvement in setting up both SJP and AMP, the two organizations have long-standing links. Starting in 2006 when AMP was founded, the organization placed a heavy emphasis on supporting and helping coordinate the activities of SJP, assisting in its development as one of the primary organizers of anti-Israel campaigns and events on campus over the years.

AMP described SJP as part of a âsignature projectâ to âorganize and unify the work for Palestine on campuses in the United States,â according to a 2010 brochure.

AMP leaders worked very closely with the organization, frequently advising and training students on anti-Israel activism and organizing.Â Â In October 2011, AMP supported SJPâs inaugural National Conference at Columbia University, drawing the participation of over 350 students from more than 100 schools. Sessions focused on how to strengthen anti-Israel activism on campus and how to âcombat the myths of Zionism.â AMPâs former media director Kristin Szremski conducted training at the conference as well.

AMP has advocated for SJP and other anti-Israel student groups to refrain from collaborating with Jewish or pro-Israel groups on campus initiatives, keeping in line with AMPâs âanti-normalizationâ policies with groups they view as âZionist.â In practice, this has meant a boycott of mainstream Jewish campus and national organizations. For example, AMP released a report in 2021 encouraging people to distance themselves from âZionist institutions,â listing student organizations such as Hillel (the premier Jewish college student organization in the U.S.) as well as community organizations such as JCRC, Jewish Federations and the American Jewish Committee (AJC).

Over the years, National SJP and its chapters have grown much more independent, though AMPâs support likely contributed to SJPâs rise to prominence. In 2024, SJP was a central organizing node for theÂ student encampments and anti-Israel rallies that proliferated across American universities and colleges in the spring and summer, amid a surge in antisemitic activity and sentiment on U.S. college campuses.

Since October 7, Bazian has appeared at multiple encampments on college campuses in the U.S. and abroad, offering words of encouragement to student activistsâÂ disruptiveÂ tactics.

There are also some financial links. In an April 2024 statement to the Daily Mail, AMP lawyer Christina Jump confirmed that the organization gives money to on-campus groups like SJP and fellow anti-Zionist organization Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), between $500 and $2,000 for âtangible expenses for specified events, such as food or copying costs for specifically identified gatherings.â

National AMP Leaders Repeatedly Express Support for Terror, Antisemitic Themes

On both social media and at public events, AMPâs leaders have articulated anti-Zionist and anti-Israel views that have repeatedly crossed into offensive antisemitic tropes, as well as rhetoric sympathetic to Hamas.

AMP Executive Director Dr. Osama AbuirshaidÂ gave a speech at a protest on December 1, 2023 at the Israeli Embassy in D.C. in which he denied the tragedies of October 7, including the mass killings and documented sexual assaults. âMost of the civilians were killed by their own army... They killed their own civilians... There were no rapes, that's what they told us. And they still lie to us, why?âÂ said Abuirshaid, an academic and activist who has appeared on news shows and written for several publications on Mideast issues. He also previously served as the editor of al-Zaytouna,Â a bi-weekly publication distributed by IAP,Â the now-dissolved group that disseminated Hamas propaganda.

On a separate occasion, Abuirshaid claimed that Israeli civilians were taken hostage âby mistakeâ during the October 7 invasion by Hamas terrorists, during which over 250 were abducted including an infant and elderly people.

Â 

Abuirshaid has a history of espousing language that plays into age-old antisemitic tropes of dehumanization, Jewish duplicitousness, and power.

In September 2024, at an AMP Press Conference, he accused Israel of sending âtheir embassies across the world, including the Israeli Embassy in Washington to reach out to Jewish organizations, American Jewish organizations, to apply pressure into members of Congress to go after free speech in America.â

Three years prior, in September 2021, Abuirshaid gave an interview to Jordanâs Yarmouk TV in which he stated that âIsrael today is a case of a parasite living off the American body.â In 2016, during a MAS-ICNA (Muslim American Society â Islamic Circle of North America) Convention speech, Abuirshaid referred to ââ¦the Zionist figures who hold an American passport and American citizenship but who suffer from a syndrome called double loyalty, where they put the Israeli agenda, the Israeli interests ahead of the American agenda.â

The AMP executive director has also promulgated theÂ antisemitic Khazar conspiracy theory which falsely posits that modern-day Jews are not descendants of the ancient Israelites -- rather they're descendants of the Khazars, a group of non-Jewish Eastern Europeans who converted to Judaism in the 8th century -- and therefore do not have a historical, indigenous connection to the Land of Israel.

In a February 2018 lecture at the Islamic Center of South Florida, Abuirshaid claimed, âZionism falsified history to invent what is called Israeli people today, based on religionâ and that the âoverwhelming majorityâ of âJewish people today are not the descendants of the ancient Israelites. Theyâre from the Jews of Khazaria, south of Russiaâ

At that same conference, he attacked Zionism as a âforged ideology...that hijacked a religion, an ideology that politicized the religion, an ideology that injected racism into a religionâ and claimed, âour issue is not with Judaism.â In a May 2016 tweet, he claimed that âZionism is a form of âanti-Semitismâ as it claims the âJews against the rest.ââ

Abuirshaid has also strongly implied support for the strategies and tactics of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. At the AMP annual conference in 2023, not long after the October 7 attack, he appeared to equivocate about the U.S.-designated terror organization, stating that it did not matter whether ""the U.S. rightly or wrongly designated Hamas as a terrorist organization.â

Â 

In a December 2014 Facebook post, Abuirshaid appeared to praise Hamas on its 27th anniversary, writing that it has ârejuvenated itself by adhering to its principles based on liberationâ while the rival Fatah party led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had âgrown old after deviating from the doctrine of liberation and resistance on which it was founded.â

âA distinction is made... between those who form an army for liberation, and those who prepare battalions of agents [for Israel]... a difference between those who avenge the blood of their martyrs, and those who pour [that blood] into Israeli wine glasses,"" he wrote, accusing Fatah and the PA of collaborating with Israel.

AMP founder and Board Chairman Hatem Bazian also has a long history of engaging in antisemitic conspiracy theories, sanitizing terrorism and promulgating myths of Jewish power in the U.S. government.Â In addition to his roles as founder of AMP, chairman of its board and having helped establish SJP, Bazian is a lecturer in Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies in the Department of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley and co-founder of Zaytuna College in Berkeley, where he is an assistant professor.Â Bazian has appeared on news channels such as Al Jazeera as well as the Iranian-state-controlled Press TV, which wasÂ sanctioned by the U.S. in September 2023.

Â 

In November 2024, Bazian took to X (formerly Twitter) to denigrate âinterfaith dialogueâ or what he terms âfaith washingâ and accuse any Muslim organizations or individuals participating in such events with mainstream Jewish organizations of ""getting funding & suckling on the metaphorical philanthropic golden goose of Jewish and Zionist institutions,â playing intoÂ antisemitic tropes of Jewish money and power. In the long X post, he also alleged that mainstream Jewish organizations have âtaken holdâ of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives to âcenter Zionism and Israel.â

Â 

Over the past decade, he has madeÂ orÂ shared several posts with antisemitic elements:

In July 2017, Bazian re-tweeted an antisemitic meme â for which he later apologized -- depicting an Orthodox Jewish man raising his hands in the air with text reading: âMom, look! I is chosen! I can now kill, rape, smuggle organs & steal the land of Palestinians yay #Ashke-Nazi.â
In July 2015, Bazian compared the situation in Gaza to the Holocaust, calling Gaza âan epistemic Warsaw Ghetto but only different Semites are locked up this time around.â
In January 2015, Bazian tweeted a link to an article by the Islamic Human Rights Commission which claimed: âThe Europeans who fought Nazism with arms were labeled âterroristâ by Hitler. Hamas is fighting against the occupation of Palestinian lands and is labeled âterrorist.ââ
In December 2014, Bazian played into the antisemitic trope that Jews control the U.S. government in his speech at the Muslim American Society (MAS)-Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) convention, saying, âAmerica has the best Congress that money can buy, but we also say that our Congress is an Israeli-occupied territory because Israel can get its way time and time again.â

Another prominent AMP leader is Director of Outreach & Grassroots Organizing Taher HerzallahÂ whoÂ catapulted into theÂ national spotlight in February 2010, when he and ten other students heckled then-Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren as he delivered remarks at University of California, Irvine. Herzallah and the other students were escorted out of the room and later taken to court and convicted on misdemeanor charges (except one student who settled before the conviction).

Â 

In June 2024, Herzallah spoke on a panel at the United National Antiwar Coalition (UNAC) Conference where he venerated âthe resistanceâ following the October 7 attack, referencing U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, andÂ The Houthis. Some excerpts from his comments included:

â...the events of October 7th, definitely shook the state of Israel, that's undoubtedâ¦ within a span of several hours, young men, most of whom were orphans, unraveled a security regime that had taken 75 years to build.â
âWhat the Yemenis are doing today, the Lebanese are doing today, what the Iraqis are doing today, what the Palestinians have been doing for decades, showing the world that [at] the end of the day... What matters is what happens on the ground, because nobody... could have ever told you that after 180 days, Palestinian resistance is still whooping Israel's butt.â

At theÂ May 2024 Peopleâs Conference for Palestine in Detroit, MI, which AMP endorsed, Herzallah shared extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric that echoed age-old antisemitic themes during a plenary session, saying: âThe long tentacles of Zionism have always reached deep into the American heartlandâ¦Zionism has penetrated the depths of American society, economics, and politics for decades.â

Herzallah made additional comments at that event that could be interpreted as an endorsement of audience members traveling overseas to fight Israel: âI caution you of the days to come, because they will not be easy. There are people among us today who might not be with us next year at this conference. And this is a reality. Because the liberation struggle requires sacrifice. And I know everyone here is prepared to make that sacrifice.â

Additional problematic comments from Herzallah over the years included:

December 2023: During a talk at the Islamic Center of San Diego, Herzallah described the terrorists of October 7 as âpoor, under-resourced, devastated starving peopleâ who âhave destroyed the veneer of superiority that the West and the colonizers have fed us for generations.â He further asserted that in this current political climate, it is time âto make Zionists feel very uncomfortable on campus.â
March 2023: Speaking at an event sponsored by Interfaith Communities United for Justice and Peace, Herzallah called the Holocaust movie âSchindlerâs Listâ a pro-Israel âpropaganda piece.â
March 2021: Discussing Saladinâs conquering of Jerusalem from the Crusaders during aÂ webinar with the UK-based Friends of Al-Aqsa, Herzallah suggested that the audience should view Israel as Saladin viewed the Crusaders, stating that âthe parallels between then and now are unbelievably similarâ and expressed hope that people would ârise to the occasion to defeat Zionism.â
January 2021: In a Facebook post commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Egyptian revolution, Herzallah described the 2011 violent takeover of the Israeli embassy in Cairo, during which Israeli personnel had to be rescued and airlifted to safety, as âtoo good to be true.â
March 2017: As a guest of George Mason Universityâs Muslim-Jewish Alliance, Herzallah stated that âany Muslim-Jewish partnershipâ must include âa disavowal of Zionism.â
December 2014: At AMPâs annual conference, Herzallah told the audience that âIsraelis have to be bombed, they are a threat to the legitimacy of Palestine, and it is wrong to maintain the State of Israel. It is an illegitimate creation born from colonialism and racism.â

AMP Board Member and Convention Chairman Salah Sarsour, based in Milwaukee, is the one representative who has been reportedly directly implicated in Hamas activity in the West Bank in the 1990s.

According to a 2001 FBI memorandum, Jamil Sarsour was arrested in 1998 for funding Hamas and told Israeli investigators that his brother Salah Sarsour was involved in funding Hamas through his fundraising for theÂ Holy Land Foundation (HLF).

Â 

In 1995, Salah Sarsour was arrested and imprisoned by Israel for eight months for supporting Hamas. According to his brother, while in prison, Salah became close to the West Bank commander of Hamasâs al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas.

In addition to his position with AMP, according to Wisconsin state records, from 2005 to 2016, Sarsour was the registered agent of the Muslim American Society (MAS) in Milwaukee, a non-profit educational and religious organization that defended the HLF case.

AMP Activities: Anti-Israel Rallies and Protests Post October 7

Since October 7, 2023, AMP hasÂ co-sponsored over 300 anti-Israel rallies. The tone was set just a day after the Hamas attack, when AMP NJ posted about a rally to âdefend Palestinian resistanceâ that included an image of a bulldozer breaking through Gaza-Israel border fence on October 7.

On April 1, 2024, AMPâs New Jersey chapter co-sponsored a protest with radical anti-Zionist organizationÂ Within Our Lifetime (WOL) outside of a synagogue in Teaneck, NJ that was honoring ZAKA, an Israeli organization of volunteer emergency rescue workers who were involved in recovering, cleaning and identifying the bodies of those killed in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. ProtestersÂ shared antisemitic and extreme anti-Zionist rhetoric, including chanting, âGo back to Europe!â at Jewish individuals and holding signs with messages saying that Zionists âshould be destroy [sic].â

Â 

Other AMP-sponsored and co-sponsored protests with problematic or antisemitic elements included:

October 2024, Minneapolis, MN: A rally to mark âOne Year of Genocide, One Year of Resistanceâ included a sign reading: âWhere is your pride and sovereignty America? Free America from the Zionist Lobby.â
August 2024, Chicago, IL: At least one protestor wore a Hamas headband at a rally outside the Democratic National Convention.
October 2023, Chicago, IL: A sign depicted dollar billsÂ in the shape of a snake, bloody handprints and the message âZionism is racismâ with the letter âsâ stylized as a dollar sign.

AMP Chapter Leaders and Activists Espouse Rhetoric That Sanitizes Terrorism, Engage in Far-Right Conspiracy Theories

In addition to egregious rhetoric from AMPâs national leadership, AMP chapter leaders and members across the country also regularly express antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media, engage in inflammatory language about Zionism and the Jewish community and praise FTOs such as Hamas.

In one instance, an AMP employee appeared on a panel that was sponsored byÂ Samidoun, an extreme anti-Zionist group that was sanctioned by the U.S. government in October 2024 for fundraising forÂ The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), an FTO.

Zarefah Baroud, AMPâs digital media associate, also appeared at an event hosted by Samidoun in April 2024. In October 2024, Baroud was a keynote speaker with her father, anti-Israel journalist and editor-in-chief of theÂ Palestine ChronicleÂ Ramzy Baroud, at an event titled âPulse of Palestine: Resistance and Prisonersâ in Olympia, Washington. She referred to October 7 as the âAl Aqsa Flood,â which is the name chosen by Hamas for their âoperationâ on that horrific day.

Â 

Neveen Ayesh, the government relations coordinator for AMP Missouri, has shared videos from Hamasâs military wing and of its spokesman, Abu Obaida, on X in addition to praising Hamas as âan ideology for freedomâ and lionizing the late arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar.

In addition to praising terrorists, Ayesh has also spread antisemitic conspiracy theories. On January 1, 2024, she posted about theÂ tunnels under Chabad Headquarters in New York City and suggested such tunnels were being built across the country: âTunnels in New York, United States of America. Ask them about this theyâll respond by asking whether or not you condemn Hamas.Â I need the same folks talking about the southern border being open, looking underground. When are we going to start having honest conversations?â

Â 

Ayesh has also expressed support for antisemitic right-wing commentator Candace Owens. On August 24, 2024, she tweeted in response to Owens complaining about the FBI and âZionist organizationsâ saying she wants to âapplaud this woman for her bravery bc [sic] a lot of us have been paying a heavy price for just being honest. The manipulation and defamation is crazy. The fbi [sic] reports, the Zionists taking their terror to mainstream media bc [sic] they canât cancel you on social media.â

Sayel Kayed, vice chair of AMP New Jersey, has retweeted antisemitic and problematic accounts like far-right commentator and influencer Jackson Hinkle, an anti-LGBTQ post from self-described misogynistÂ Andrew Tate and content from antisemitic conspiracy theorist Jake Shields. In May 2024, Kayed encouraged his Facebook followers to rally at a synagogueâs Yom HaZikaron event commemorating fallen Israeli soldiers and victims of terror.

Funding

AMPâs fiscal sponsor is the Americans for Justice in Palestine (AJP) Educational Foundation. Its funding is quite opaque though some insights can be gleaned from 990 filings.

In the fiscal year ending in December 2023, AJP Educational Foundation reported revenue of $2,260,531, an increase from $1,556,567 in 2020. According toÂ tax records from that same year, the Yoosufani Family Foundation, based in Austin, TX, gave $55,000 to AJP Educational Foundation and $55,000 earmarked for AMP.

Minneapolis-based Headwaters Foundation for Justice, a community foundation that focuses on funding groups ""led by and for Black people, Indigenous people, and people of colorâ in Minnesota, said in a December 2023 grant announcement it had made rapid-response grants of $25,000 in 2023 to American Muslims for Palestine â Minnesota.

In 2022, AMP received $5,300 from Fidelity Investments Charitable Gift Fund. In 2021, it received $36,657 from the Network For Good, and $10,548 from the American Online Giving Foundation in 2020.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-colleges-and-universities-are-failing-fight-antisemitism-campus,"New York, NY, April 11, 2024 â¦ Today, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) released its firstÂ Campus Antisemitism Report Card assessing incidents, Jewish life on campus and university policies and administrative actions related to combatting antisemitism and protecting Jewish students.

The Report Card reviewed 85 schools and assigned grades from A through F, to give campus leadership, parents, students, alumni and stakeholders a mechanism to evaluate the state of antisemitism on campus and how schools across the country are responding.Â Two schools received an âA,â 17 schools received a âB,â 29 schools received a âC,â 24 schools received a âD,â and 13 schools received an âFâ grade.

âEvery campus should get an A â thatâs not grade inflation, thatâs the minimum that every group on every campus expects. Like all students, Jewish students deserve to feel safe and supported on campus. They deserve a learning environment free from antisemitism and hate. But that hasnât been the experience with antisemitism running rampant on campus since even before October 7,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âAt a time when antisemitic incidents on campus are at historic levels, administrators need to adopt new policies to address this scourge and have the willingness to enforce existing codes of conduct to ensure all students are safe.â

Â 

The Report Card reveals that colleges must develop strong policies and procedures to address conduct that creates a hostile environment, while also swiftly enforcingÂ those policies fairly when students, staff or faculty violate them.

Examples of better performing schools include:

Brandeis University (A) was the first private university to revoke official recognition of its Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter due to the groupâs activity on campus in the wake of the October 7 attacks. Brandeis also made clear that antisemitic phrases such as âFrom the River to the Seaâ are hate speech and are contrary to the universityâs principles.
Â 
Elon University (A) provided opportunities for the community to learn more about the Oct. 7 attack and encouraged occasions for dialogue, including an event entitled âContextualizing the Conflict: Conversations about the Middle East,â which was attended by over 200 students, faculty and staff.Â Â 
Â 
University of Miami (B) President Julio Frenk released a statement âIn Solidarity with Israelâ on Oct. 9, 2023. The University has recently publicly condemned antisemitic incidents.
Â 
University of Maryland (B) President Darryl Pines issued two statements after Oct. 7, the first immediately condemning the Hamas attack and the second ensuring the safety of Jewish students on campus and condemning acts of discrimination and all forms of hate. The school also increased campus safety measures and created a task force to provide recommendations on a strategy to confront antisemitism.
Â 
University of Texas, Austin (B) has spoken out repeatedly against antisemitic vandalism on campus. Additionally, the university issued a strong statement in the wake of October 7.
Â 
Washington University in St. Louis (B) Chancellor Andrew Martin issued a statement condemning antisemitism, writing that he was âdeeply disturbed to learn that during gatherings on campus in the past week, antisemitic phrases were chanted and written on signs.â The University mandated antisemitism education for its campus community.Â 

Many campuses across the country are not doing as well in responding to antisemitism. University of Hartford, Indiana University and University of Colorado at Boulder received a grade of C.Â D-rated schools include Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania, Ohio State University, University of California at Berkeley, and Rice University.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Tufts University and University of North Carolina â Chapel Hill are among the schools receiving a failing F grade.Â 

âAs I travel the country, Iâm constantly hearing from Jewish families agonizing over where they will send their kids to college,â said Greenblatt. âSchool leadership must make serious changes to support Jewish communities on their campus; we expect nothing less.Â Along with the Report Card, weâre providing guidelines and resources for how schools can improve campus climate and therefore improve their grades, and we look forward to working with them and other partners to achieve that reasonable goal.âÂ 

ADL consulted with a panel of experts that included Rabbi Kevin Fried, Managing Director at the Jewish Graduate Student Initiative, Sally Mason, former president of the University of Iowa and Dr. William âBritâ Kirwan, Chancellor Emeritus of the University System of Maryland, among others, talked with campus administrators, and also looked at what the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism recommended to draw up a list of 21 criteria for assessment, categorized into: administrative action and policies, incidents on campus, and Jewish student life on campus.

The 85 schools selected reflect the top national and liberal arts schools, as well as schools with the highest proportion of Jewish students. ADL provided each school with a questionnaire to self-report which of the criteria they fulfilled or pledged to fulfill in 2024, ultimately receiving input from 84% of assessed campuses. ADL also conducted research to assess which of the criteria each campus fulfilled and to gather additional information, such as pending Title VI investigations, on each campus.

âItâs time for campuses to step up and protect our children from the hate and antisemitism that has proliferated on college campuses across the country this year,â said Emma Law-Oppman of Mothers Against College Antisemitism. âIt is our hope that ADLâs Report Card serves as a much-needed wakeup call for schools to prioritize creating a safe and welcoming environment for all students. At M.A.C.A., our members are fully prepared and energized to demand a massive change from school leadership across the country.â

In a collaborative statement from the Jewish and Jewish Heritage Greek organizations: Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Delta Tau, and Zeta Beta Tau, Bonnie Wunsch, Executive Director of Alpha Epsilon Phi said, âWe welcome ADLâs new Campus Report Card to assess the state of antisemitism on campus and policies to combat it. This tool provides critical information to answer the questions we are regularly fielding from students and their families. Not only is the moment for this now, but ADL is the right organization to do it.â

TheÂ Report Card website has a comparison tool to allow users to select up to three colleges for side-by-side comparison, enabling them to simultaneously view the grades and the fulfillment of criteria for all three.

The Report Card is part of ADLâs recently launched NotÂ On My Campus campaign, calling on U.S. colleges and universities to commit to no tolerance for antisemitism. This campaign is a direct response to the significant rise of antisemitic incidents since October 7, with less than half (46 percent) of Jewish studentsÂ surveyed feeling physically safe on their campuses during the fall semester of the 2023-2024 school year.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/dearborn-nyc-quds-day-protesters-praise-terrorists-denounce-us-and-call,"Over the weekend of April 5, 2024, anti-Israel activists in the US and around the world marked Al Quds Day (âJerusalem Dayâ) with protests and other events against Zionism and the state of Israel. This annual event, originallyâ¯conceivedâ¯by the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, serves as a platform for support for terrorism and other violence against Israel and regularly includes virulent antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric.Â Â 

Â 

This yearâs Quds Day protests â which came nearly six months into the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas that was triggered by the Palestinian terror groupâs October 7, 2023 attack on Israel â were no different.Â Â 

Â 

As they have done consistently over the last six months, anti-Israel protesters at Quds Day events across the US repeatedly characterized the violent actions of Hamas and other US-designated terrorist groups likeâ¯Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and theâ¯Houthis (Ansar Allah) not as condemnable terrorism, but as admirable so-called âresistance.â In their speeches, chants, and signs, protestors called for Israelâs destruction and an end to Zionism. By engaging in this rhetoric, protesters also effectively vilified the vast majority of American Jews who view a connection to Israel as an important part of their Jewish identity.Â 

Â 

Al Quds protests in Dearborn, MI and New York, NY were particularly notable for their size and the concerning, violent nature of the rhetoric used by speakers and attendees. Protesters in numerous other cities also expressed similarly problematic sentiments.Â 

Â 

Dearborn Protesters Sing the Praises of Terrorists and Call for âDeathâ to Israel and AmericaÂ 

Â 

At a Quds Day demonstration that attracted hundreds of attendees outside the Henry Ford Centennial Library in Dearborn, MI on April 5, protesters chanted, in Arabic, âDeath to Israelâ and âDeath to America.â A protester proudly displayed an image of Iranâs Ayatollah Khomeini while others held signs with messages that included âThe Zionist entity has no right to existâ and âFrom the river to the sea! Expel all occupiers.âÂ 

Â 

Activist Tarek Bazzi began the event by asking the crowd to pray for âthe victory of the resistanceâ and referred to âthe resistance fighters [who] engage in battle with this godless, satanic cancer that is called Israel.â Bazzi also stated that âthe chant, âdeath to Israel,â has become the most logical chant shouted across the world today.â He urged the crowd to use the occasion of Quds Day and the current Israel-Hamas war to âturn back to the real Islamâ¦That Islam that taught the resistance to prepare whatever strength and whatever weaponry it can in order to confront and to deter the enemies of Allah.âÂ Â 

Â 

Shaykh Usama Abdulghani â a Dearborn-based imam and Islamic scholar who has a history of praising groups like HamasÂ  and figures such as former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Qassim Soleimani â also spoke during the protest. Abdulghani proudly declared that âthe Zionists are no match for the men of the resistanceâ and that âthe resistance dismantled the myth of Israeli invincibility.âÂ 

Shaykh Usama Abdulghani speaks at the Al Quds Day protest in Dearborn, MI on April 5, 2024.

Â 

He further equated Israel with Nazis and praised not just Palestinian so-called âresistance,â but terrorist forces in other countries as well, for âdoing the moral responsibilityâ of actively supporting Palestine and âpushing back against those monsters [Israel].â Abdulghani expanded on this sentiment later in his remarks when he explicitly named a number of recognized terrorist groups and their leaders:Â Â 

âWe want to thank the resistance in Palestine. We want to thank Abu Obaida [spokesperson for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas], Abu Hamza [spokesperson for the Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)] and the Palestinian resistanceâ¦We kiss the hands of the Palestinian people who resisted and made this possibleâ¦We thank our brothers and sisters in Yemen â both Ansar Allah [aka the Houthis] and the leader of the resistance, Sayyid Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi [leader of the Houthis]. We thank all of them for doing their responsibility, their moral duty. We thank Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah [secretary-general of Hezbollah], we thank Hezbollahâ¦We thank the Husayn of our time, Imam Khamenei [the current Supreme Leader of Iran]â¦Bless all of the martyrs, those who went recently and those who helped arm the resistance so that they'd be able to defend themselves and their families, like Haj' Qassem [aka Qassim Soleimani].âÂ 

Later at the Dearborn Quds Day protest, speaker Hassan Al-Thani told the crowd that âPalestinians have the full right to fight back and resist against their colonizersâ¦Using any means necessary,â emphasizing that this âincludes armed resistance.â Al-Thani added that âPalestinian liberation will happen through resistance, not through the UN [United Nations] or the polls or the ICJ [International Court of Justice]. Victory will be achieved through a resistance as God commands.â He also instructed those in the crowd to âbe part of it and resist in any way that we can,â adding, âwe must do whatever God has put at our disposal towards His cause, whether it's armed resistance or blocking off sea routes or halting oil exports, cutting ties, providing financial aid,â or taking other actions.Â 

Â 

Support for Terrorism Also Marks Quds Day Protest in New York CityÂ 

Â 

Another significant protest took place in New York, NY on April 5, beginning with speeches in Times Square and the repeated, open celebration of terrorism against Israel. The individual leading the protest opened her remarks by explaining the history of Al Quds Day, and the theme for this yearâs demonstrations. Throughout her speech, she referenced the October 7 terrorist attack against Israel using the Hamas-designated name, âAl Aqsa Floodâ:Â 

â[Al Quds Day] is a day to specifically highlight the united resistance front that spans across the broader region. From Iran to Iraq, to Lebanon, to Yemen, to Syriaâ¦The official theme of Al Quds Day 2024 isâ¦âThe Flood of Freedom.â The theme flood of freedom honors the ongoing Al Aqsa Flood which has truly changed the equation on the ground forever and has hastened the termination date of the Zionist entityâ¦One that has not only flooded the goals of the Zionist entity, but a flood that has rejuvenated the love of resistance and the remembrance of the martyrs in our hearts. This flood of liberation and freedom that spans across the entire resistance axis is what we honor during this Al Quds Day and throughout the rest of our existence.âÂ 

A speaker with the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) who also spoke at the New York demonstration stated: âToday on Al Quds Day, here and around the world, we affirm that we stand firmly with Palestine and with the resistance!â¦They are giving their lives to fight the evils of US imperialism and Zionism.â The PYM speaker added that, âGaza is standing up for the world because they know what all of us should know by now: that there is no place in this world for the evil of Zionism and imperialism! There is no place in this world for the genocidal Israeli stateâ¦The Zionist entity will not survive.âÂ

Â 

Another speaker, representing the ANSWER Coalition, praised the âunfathomable braveryâ and âfortitudeâ of the so-called âresistance,â while a speaker affiliated with the Bronx Anti-War Coalition stated: âPalestine will not be liberated by Western courts and institutions, but by revolutionary armed struggle and disruptive acts of international solidarity. So, only the Palestinian resistance and the axis of resistance can build a legitimate path towards total liberation of Palestine. And that is why we say: Long live the resistance!â Another speaker openly praised a US-designated terror group by name, stating: âWe salute Hezbollah!âÂ 

Â 

In between speakers and later while marching through midtown Manhattan, the protesters repeatedly chanted: âFlood of Aqsa, Flood of Aqsa; We are with the Intifadaâ â referring in the first part of the chant to the Hamas-designated name for the October 7 attack on Israel, and in the second partÂ  to two historical periods in the late 1980s and early 2000s in which Palestinian terrorists committed indiscriminate acts of violence against Israelis. Other chants heard throughout the protest included: âSmash the settler Zionist stateâ; âZionists youâll remain no longer; Resistance is growing strongerâ; âOn the streets, we will flood; Honoring the martyrsâ bloodâ; and âResistance is the only way.âÂ 

Â 

Other Quds Day Protests NationwideÂ 

Â 

Beyond Dearborn and New York, other Quds Day protests in the US saw similar expressions of overt support for terror and extreme anti-Zionist and anti-Israel rhetoric.Â 

A protester holds a sign that reads âEnd of Zionism = end of terrorism = peaceâ at the Al Quds Day protest in Dallas, TX on April 5, 2024.

Â 

In both Dallas, TX and Houston, TX on April 5, protesters held signs that vilified and called for an end to Zionism. These messages included: âDown with Zionismâ; âEnd of Zionism = end of terrorism = peaceâ; âZionism = genocide of babies, racism, apartheid, occupation, oppressionâ; and âZionism and Jews are opposites; respect the Jews, oppose Zionists.â Also in Houston, a speaker characterized Zionism as a âcancerous tumorâ and predicted that ""it will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed.âÂ Â 

Â 

Another individual at the Houston protest stated that â[Al Quds Day] comes on the backdrop of the Al-Aqsa Flood from October 7, which effectively exposed the fallacy of the Zionist security and intelligence.â He lauded the âlong, meticulously planned operation by the Gaza-based resistance group that crafted a new path in the Palestinian struggle for freedom from Zionist settler colonialism.â The speaker also praised the âformidableâ actions by the âresistance movementâ in other countries, alluding to both Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, commenting: âThis captures what Quds Day is all about. It is a global movement from the west to the east for the people of Palestine.âÂ 

Â 

In Chicago, IL on April 5, a speaker affiliated with the Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) celebrated âthe heroic Palestinian people and the axis of resistance,â stating that âthey are blazing a new future. They are defeating the Zionists!â Drawing cheers from the crowd, the speaker added: âLet us all thank the Palestinian resistance for launching the Al Aqsa Flood. Liberation is at hand!âÂ 

Â 

At that same protest, a speaker affiliated with a local Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter similarly praised how âthe axis of resistance has gained as much strength as it has.â A speaker affiliated with ANSWER Coalition stated: âThe last six months have proven that the Palestinian resistance cannot and will not be defeated!âÂ 

Social media graphics posted by event organizers advertising the Al Quds Day protest in Boston, MA on April 5, 2024 call for the exclusion of Zionists and use the popular inverted red triangle symbol.

Â 

In Boston, MA on April 5, anti-Israel protesters used the occasion of Quds Day to target a touring performance by the Israeli-based dance company Vertigo at the Shubert Theatre. Posts advertising the protest declared: âZIONISM IS NOT WELCOME HERE!â¦We send a clear message of rejection of Zionism! There is no space for Zionism in dance. There is no space for Zionism in Bostonâ and âAs we honor Al Quds day, it is our duty to reject ALL forms of normalisation [sic] with the Zionist entity.â The protest was co-sponsored by groups that included the local chapters of the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), ANSWER Coalition, as well as BDS Boston and various Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapters from local universities.Â Â 

Â 

Protesters picketed outside the venue before the performance, with one of the protesters declaring over a megaphone: âWe are not just protesting normalization, but we are also honoring our lands, and Al Quds, and all of our martyrs. Glory to the martyrs and glory to the Palestinian resistance!âÂ Â 

Â 

Another protester waved a flag and wore a headband bearing the logo of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a US-designated terrorist group. Others carried signs with messages that included âResistance is the future; Down with âIsraelââ and âCeasefire isnât enough; Palestine needs victory.âÂ 

Â 

At the Washington, DC Al Quds Day protest on April 6, a speaker from the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) claimed: âNever has it been more clear that Zionism is a disgusting, depraved, genocidal ideology and movement.â She added: âIsrael is a failed project; no matter what they do, we will all bear witness to its inevitable demise.âÂ 

Â 

Al Quds Day protests also took place in Atlanta, GA; Paterson, NJ; Providence, RI; San Diego, CA; Seattle, WA and other cities.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/coe-investigation-reveals-key-perpetrators-107-sexual-assault-denial-x,"CW: This piece contains reference to rape and sexual assault

In the wake of the October 7 terror attack in Israel, horrific details began to emerge of Hamas assailants brutalizing Israeli women and girls, parading their broken bodies through the streets, and concertgoers being raped and murdered in front of their friends. By November, videos and eyewitness testimony were widely available to the public, showing and describing Hamas terrorists using rape as a weapon of war.Â Â 

Â 

Despite evidence of widespread sexual assault by Hamas, there was no global outcry. Some journalists even wrote off the rape testimony as âIsraeli propagandaâ being used to distract from the war. As more evidence emerged, prominent international womenâs groups like UN Women refused for weeks to condemn or acknowledge the devastating impact of Hamasâs misogynist rampage.Â 

The staggering hypocrisy of this gutless silence from international âfeministâ organizations and âfeministsâ around the world reflects a broader issue, highlighted by the âMe Too Unless Youâre a Jewâ campaign: the rules are different for Israeli and Jewish women. Dehumanizing Israeli women by writing off their lived experiences is antisemitic.Â 

In March 2024, nearly six months after the terror attacks on Israel, the denial of sexual assault by Hamas continues across social media platforms and beyond.Â  The trend has been particularly glaring on X (formerly Twitter), where denialists have significant audiences.Â Â 
Â 

An analysis by the ADL Center on Extremism identifies five X influencers responsible for sharing the widest-reaching posts supporting sexual assault denial since October 7, finding that while these users span the political spectrum, they all have a history of promoting an anti-Zionist and anti-Israel agenda.Â Â 
Â Â 
Data analysis on XÂ 
Â 
From October 7, 2023, to March 19, 2024, five key influencers played a prominent role in spreading the narrative denying sexual assault against victims of October 7. The following five examples are the highest-reaching conspiratorial posts from each influencer promoting this narrative. These five posts alone garnered over 193 thousand likes and over 80 thousand reposts, with a combined estimated reach of 45 million. On X, the âreachâ metric indicates how many users are estimated to have seen a given post based on a combination of factors, including follower count, engagement and approximate view counts.Â

Â 

Jackson Hinkle is a far-right influencer and commentator who has heavily engaged in anti-Israel and antisemitic rhetoric in recent months in addition to spreading false narratives about the Israel-Hamas war, as tracked by the ADL Center on Extremism. Hinkle is just one of many influential accounts on the âanti-Israel far-right,â which include Stew Peters, Lucas Gage and Tristan Tate, the brother of misogynist influencer Andrew Tate.Â Â Â 
Â 

In his post, Hinkle claims, âThere is NO evidence Hamas raped Israelis,â followed by other alleged actions by Hamas that have been the source of public debate. However, his assertion that there is no proof of rape is false based on a growing body of evidence, including eyewitness reports and videos.

Â 

Aaron MatÃ©, a writer for The Grayzone, a fringe far-left blog site, not only implies in this post that the rape allegations are unsubstantiated, but - by saying that â... âstoriesâ like this are only starting to âsurfaceâ now. It seems clear that this is yet another fabrication in the service of genocideâ - he also claims that these testimonies are emerging during the Israel-Hamas war to serve as an Israeli propaganda tool. By deeming Israeli rape victimsâ testimonies as mere âstories,â MatÃ© diminishes their pain and suffering, effectively dehumanizing them.Â

Briahna Joy Gray is a political commentator, podcaster, former Politico journalist and former Press Secretary for Bernie Sandersâ 2020 presidential campaign. In recent months, Gray has been increasingly vocal about her stance against Zionism and continues to promote conspiratorial claims about the Israel-Hamas war.Â Â 
Â 
In the post, Gray argues, ââBelieve all womenâ was always an absurd overreach: woman [sic] should be heard, claims should be investigated, but evidence is required. The same is true of the allegations out of Israel. But also, this isnât a âbelieve womenâ scenario bc no female victims have offered testimony.âÂ Â 
Â 
By promoting these falsehoods, Gray is essentially undermining the credibility of female rape victims everywhere, while ignoring how many of the rape victims from October 7 are believed to have been murdered and therefore cannot offer testimony.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-praises-members-congress-introduction-historic-countering-antisemitism,"New York, NY, April 10, 2024 â¦Â ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today welcomed the introduction of the Countering Antisemitism Actâthe most comprehensive antisemitism initiative to be introduced in Congressâwhich will implement the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and make permanent its critical policies and infrastructure.

âThe U.S. Jewish community is facing the worst crisis of antisemitism that we have seen in a generation. The Countering Antisemitism Act offers a smart, innovative whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to combating this hatred and protecting Jews around the country,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âThis historic bill is the most far-reaching antisemitism initiative ever to be introduced in Congress. We applaud the Countering Antisemitism Act and its efforts to implement the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and make it permanent.â

In the aftermath of Hamasâs deadly attack on Oct. 7, ADL hasÂ tracked a dramatic surge of antisemitic incidents. ADL is proud to be working closely with Sens. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and James Lankford (R-OK) and Reps. Kathy Manning (D-NC) and Chris Smith (R-NJ), Co-Chairs of the House and Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism to ensure that the whole of government is meeting this moment with effective and thoughtful policy.Â ADL will launch a grassroots advocacy campaign pushing for Congressional support and timely passage of the Countering Antisemitism Act.Â Â 

The Countering Antisemitism Act will create lasting executive structures to prioritize fighting antisemitism, including a domestic National Coordinator to Counter Antisemitism and a dedicated Task Force that meets regularly to coordinate efforts to fight antisemitism across agencies.

It will also promote Holocaust education, address the scourge of antisemitism on college and university campuses across the country, support the life-saving Nonprofit Security Grant Program, celebrate Jewish life by declaring May âJewish American Heritage Month,â and more.

âThe U.S. government must pursue policies and create the necessary infrastructure to fight antisemitism today and well into the future, and these efforts must endure beyond any single administration or 12-month timeline,â said Greenblatt. âThank you, Sens. Jacky Rosen and James Lankford and Reps. Kathy Manning and Chris Smith, Co-Chairs of the House and Senate Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism, for leading this critical, timely bipartisan initiative.â

Following years of ADL advocacy, in May 2023, the White House published the historicÂ U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which for the first time elevated the fight against antisemitism to a federal priority.Â ADL actively assisted in the development of the White House strategy, contributing more than 30 distinct policy recommendations, andÂ has maintained an online tracker of its progress to date.

ADL also organized grassroots advocates to urge Congress and the Biden Administration to develop a unified national strategy to monitor and combat antisemitism. The foundations for these policies were set in part by ADLâsÂ COMBAT Plan, a proposed set of government initiatives to fight antisemitism, which ADL originally released in June 2022. The COMBAT Plan articulated several of the key policies that were ultimately included in the national strategy, such as efforts around education, community safety, hate crimes, and online hate.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/community-church-chesterland-files-federal-lawsuit-against-members-ohio,"New York, NY, April 10, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and Jones Day today filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against members of a White Lives Matter chapter in Ohio seeking compensatory and punitive damages for their involvement in a hate crime attack targeting the Community Church of Chesterland and three individual plaintiffs in March 2023.Â 

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleges that members of the local White Lives Matter (WLM) chapter conspired to violate and deprive the church of its civil and property rights by throwing a Molotov cocktail at the church building âwith the intent to burn it to the ground.âÂ Â 

âUsing photos and evidence from their own statements, social media messages and hate literature, the complaint we filed today meticulously documents how members of a local White Lives Matter chapter conspired to deprive members of the Community Church of Chesterland of their church property,â said James Pasch, ADL Senior Director of National Litigation. âTheir resultant actions in targeting a community church with a hate crime are not just morally abhorrent, they are a clear violation of federal civil rights and property law.â

âAs alleged in the complaint, our clients represent a community of faith that is open and welcoming to all, especially those that have felt marginalized or excluded from other religious activities,â said Justin Herdman, a partner in Jones Dayâs Cleveland Office and former United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. âThis faith community was violently attacked by White Lives Matter simply because the churchâs inclusivity conflicts with the WLM movementâs objective of establishing a 99% White population by forcibly eliminating anyone not meeting their stated desired racial, ethnic, religious, gender or sexual orientation demographics for the country.â

Names of defendants include Aimenn D. Penny â who was convicted of federal offenses stemming from the arson attack against the Community ChurchÂ on March 25, 2023 â as well as other members of White Lives Matter. Aimenn Penny, 20,Â is currently serving an 18-year federal prison sentence after pleading guilty last year to federal hate crime and arson offenses.Â 

The suit alleges the defendants conspired to interfere with the civil rights of church members by damaging religious property âbecause of their discriminatory animus toward Community Churchâs religious beliefs and practices,â culminating with the intentional vandalism of church property with a Molotov cocktail, which caused damage to the exterior walls of the church building and a banner hung on the churchâs exterior.Â Â 

Defendant Penny, in expressing his vile hate, had previously stated to law enforcement officials that âhe believed African Americans were solely responsible for the high crime rate across the countryâ and he âlooks forward to the civil war coming between races.â Defendant Penny âexpressed his belief that the United States will not prosper until all the other races, or âweaknessesâ as he called them, are gone.â Shortly before the attack at Community Church, WLM members attended a rally âcarrying swastika flags and shouting racial and homophobic slurs and âHeil Hitler.ââ On March 24, 2023, Community Church received a voicemail with direct threats of violence directed at the Church due to the communityâs support for LGBTQIA rights.

According to the ADL Center on Extremism, WLM Ohio is part of a white supremacist network of individuals who advocate for and promote white supremacy, white racial consciousness and the perceived interests of white children.Â 

WLM was responsible for 160 incidents of spreading racist propaganda in 2023, according to ADL, ranging from âWhite Lives Matterâ stickers to spreading messages about the antisemitic and racist âgreat replacement conspiracy theory.Â 

The lawsuit seeks a jury trial on five counts, including conspiracy to interfere with civil rights; conspiracy to prevent freedom of access to a place of religious worship; civil liability for vandalism, desecration, or ethnic intimidation; trespass to land; and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â Â 

â(The) defendants intentionally caused emotional distress to Community Church, its members and its clergy by threatening to protest outside of Community Churchâs Drag Storytime event and by throwing Molotov cocktailsâ at the church, the suit states. ââ¦ Community Church is entitled to compensatory damages, punitive damages and damages for costs and reasonable attorneysâ fees.âÂ 

The suit was filed on behalf of Community Church of Chesterland, by attorneys at Jones Day and ADL.Â Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/standwithus-adl-brandeis-center-file-title-vi-complaint-against-ohio-state,"New York, NY, April 9, 2024 â¦ Three Jewish defense organizations today submitted a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office for Civil Rights (OCR) against Ohio State University, alleging that the university has failed to address the severe discrimination and harassment of Jewish and Israeli students following the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, which fostered âa hostile antisemitic environment that is now pervasiveâ at Ohio State.

The complaint, filed jointly by StandWithUs, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, alleges that since the events on Oct. 7, Jewish students at OSU have faced a litany of antisemitic incidents, verbal taunts and threats and threatening graffiti in classrooms and university facilities, as well as the removal of posters and photos of kidnapped Israelis and the outright physical assault of Jewish students. The complaint seeks remedies under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

âSince October 7, Jewish students on campuses nationwideÂ have faced unprecedented antisemitic harassment and discrimination,âÂ said Roz Rothstein, StandWithUs CEO.Â âOhio State University is no exception. Antisemitism is expressed openly; blatant verbal and physical threats and attacks on Jewish students often go unaddressed by the administration. By filing this Title VI federal complaint, we aim to hold the administration accountable.â

âWe believe all the evidence shows that despite a pattern of escalating harassment and intimidation, Ohio State University administrators, faculty and staff repeatedly failed in their duty to protect Jewish and Israeli students from such attacks,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âWe urge the U.S. Department of Education to investigate these incidents and compel the university to take immediate action to address the pervasively hostile environment for Jewish and Israelis on OSUâs campus.â

âThere is a clear, direct, and indisputable correlation between lack of accountability and rising levels of antisemitism,â stated Kenneth L. Marcus, chairman of the Brandeis Center and the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights. âSchools must act immediately to address incidents and hold violators accountable. Unfortunately schools like Ohio State that continue to sweep incidents under the rug are getting worse by the day. Â The problem cannot be ignored. Â Schools must uphold the law and address each and every incident of antisemitic discrimination and harassment or the problem will continue to snowball.â

The complaint alleges that the university failed to meaningfully address a long list of incidents affecting Jewish and Israeli students, constituting a violation of Title VI.

Some specific examples cited in the complaint include:

In early November, a group of five Jewish students walking to an OSU Sorority House were accosted by two men who shouted, âFree Palestine.â When the two men caught up to the group of five Jewish students, one of them saw that a person in the group was wearing a Hebrew-lettering Chai necklace and called him a âZionist kike.â He pointed at that Jewish student and asked, âAre you a Jew?â He then proceeded to ask all five of them if they were Jews. The student wearing the Chai necklace acknowledged that they were Jewish, and then seconds later, one of the two men punched one of the Jewish students in the face and threw him into the street. The other individual punched another of the Jewish students across the face just seconds later. The attackers fled the scene. The Jewish students suffered a broken nose and a broken jaw.Â 
After arriving at the OSU Medical Center, only the one student who was bleeding profusely and needed immediate medical care was seen, and he was allowed only one guest. The other Jewish students, including the other student who had been violently assaulted, were made to wait outside in the freezing cold for over five hours. The Jewish students were denied entrance into their own universityâs hospital waiting room and the building, and werenât even allowed to charge their cell phones so that they could contact friends and family. Even after subsequent complaints were made about this mistreatment, no one from the University hospital has contacted the students to let them know why they were treated in this manner or to identify any policies or procedures that would be changed to ensure that such mistreatment is not repeated.
On December 9, 2023, a Jewish student wearing a sweatshirt bearing the words âAm Yisrael Chaiâ in the shape of a Jewish star was confronted on the way to his final exam by another student who told him to âtake that f-ing shirt off now.â
On January 26, 2024, a Jewish student living in off-campus housing found that their mezuzah (a symbol of their Jewish identity) had been torn from their doorpost and thrown on the ground, and that on February 23, 2024, a Jewish studentâs dorm room door was vandalized with graffiti reading, âFree Palestine.â
On February 2, 2024, Jewish students eating Shabbat dinner at the campus Hillel were interrupted by students banging on the Hillel windows and shouting, âFree Palestine.â
On February 15, 2024, Jewish students at the Ohio Union trying to gather signatures on a petition against antisemitism were confronted by a man saying he would not sign because he wants to âkill Jews.â The following day, someone stole an Israeli flag from the Ohio Union after a multicultural event there and proceeded to flash a âwhite powerâ sign and harass Jewish students.

The complaint urges OCR to compel the universityâs administration to implement a series of measures necessary to secure the safety of Jewish and Israeli students at OSU, including by issuing a public statement condemning antisemitic hostility on campus and devoting more resources and increasing security measure to deter future attacks. The complaint also urges the university to incorporate the IHRA working definition of antisemitism into its campus policies concerning discrimination to better recognize the types of antisemitic discrimination confronting Jewish students, and to provide mandatory antisemitism training to university administrators, faculty, students and staff.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-masa-israel-journey-collaborate-fight-antisemitism,"Jerusalem/ New York, NY, April 9, 2024 â¦ The Masa Israel Journey, a leading provider of immersive travel experiences, and ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced a new partnership to combat antisemitism in Jewish communities. This partnership will launch at an event in Jerusalem for Masa gap year program fellows, during which ADL will lead sessions to help fellows prepare to manage antisemitism on college campuses.Â 

Â 

Through the partnership, ADL will provide Masa Israel resources, specialized training for staff and interns, educational opportunities in Israel, enhanced reporting resources for fellows and alumni, and co-facilitated webinars for alumni.Â Â 

Â 

""Joining forces with Masa Israel Journey represents a powerful alliance in our fight against antisemitism,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âBy equipping Masa fellows and alumni with the necessary tools and resources to counter antisemitism, we are empowering the next generation of Jewish leaders to stand up against hate, protecting Jewish communities worldwide.âÂ 

Â 

This partnership comes as antisemitic incidents are skyrocketing. Recently, an ADL survey revealed anti-Jewish attitudes are at an all-time high, with 24-percent of Americans harboring extensive antisemitic prejudice, up from 20 percent in 2022. In January, ADL released preliminary data finding a total of 3,291 antisemitic incidents between Oct. 7 and Jan. 7, a 361-percent increase over the year prior, putting 2023 on track to be the worst year since ADL started tracking this data in the late 1970s.Â 

Â 

âThis partnership between Masa and the ADL is very important, especially now,â said Yael Sahar Rubinstein, Acting CEO of Masa Israel Journey. âADL has a lot of knowledge and experience to share with our fellows. This partnership is a crucial step for Jewish communities around the world. It will help to build an even stronger community of leaders and it will encourage Jews to stand up for themselves and for what is right. Now more than ever, our fellows and alum need the skills to fight antisemitism in their next stages of life, and this partnership will greatly help them attain those tools.âÂ Â 

Â 

Masa alumni often become Jewish professionals, activists, and community leaders. A study [link] conducted by Impact:NPO found that 62 percent of Masa alumni describe themselves as active members of local Jewish communities, and one-in-five work in the Jewish world.Â Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-scn-urge-expanded-vigilance-preparation-us-while-encouraging-jewish,"Chicago, IL, April 5, 2024Â â In response to Israel's Foreign Ministry placing Israeli foreign missions around the world on high alert due to potential attacks against Jewish targets by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terrorist proxies, ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) and the Secure Community Network (SCN) today urged the American Jewish community to expand its vigilance and preparation to prevent attacks.

The importance of this heightened alert level was further evidenced by the repeated threats voiced by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and leaders of Tehranâs terrorist proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah.Â 

In response to these recent developments, ADL and SCN issued a joint statement:

âIn this moment of escalating international tension, the lights are blinking bright red, and they are blinking fast. The Jewish community across North America is facing unprecedented antisemitism and a heightened threat landscape and we must increase our vigilance to protect the community. We have a dual imperative to prioritize safety and security while continuing to live our lives as proud Jews. Absent actionable information provided by law enforcement or public safety partners concerning a specific facility, we are urging Jewish institutions to remain open and operational while those in charge of security, community leaders, and indeed all members of the community should heighten awareness and security measures across organizations and in daily activities. We must not allow those who seek to spread fear to win. We will never abandon what makes us Jewish in the face of those who wish us harm.â

ADL and SCN have tracked record levels of antisemitism, hate, and violence in the wake of the October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel.

As the situation continues to develop, the ADL and SCN will provide timely updates, guidance, and support to the Jewish community. Community members are urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement immediately. We also urge law enforcement authorities to be vigilant against any potential threats and act in a proactive way to thwart any potential attacks.

Hrag Vartanian
Editor and CEO
Hyperallergic

Dear Mr. Vartanian:

We were horrified and outraged by your cover story, âIsrael Flattens Neighboring Pavilions at Venice Biennale,â (April 1). While labeled in fine print as an âApril Foolsâ satire on your website, the piece has been flagged to us by many readers who found the article deeply insensitive and offensive. We agree with those readers â satire label notwithstanding, the article is little more than a gratuitous and underhanded swipe at Israel at a time when the country is still recovering from the trauma of a massive terrorist attack and when hundreds of its hostages are still unaccounted for in Gaza.

Whatâs more, your April 1 edition also featured a second âstoryâ taking pot-shots at Israel, âBerlin Museum Removes All Artwork Depicting Rivers or Seas,â which, by inference, took an extremely jaundiced view of Germanyâs longstanding support for Israel. There were no satirical articles taking a similar swipe at the terrorist group Hamas or their violent actions, which provoked the current crisis. And we also noted that your publication has run a number of news articles on the war itself, almost entirely from the pro-Palestinian perspective.

At ADL, we believe in giving leeway to satire, even when it plays on racial or ethnic stereotypes that are intended to provoke a response. But considering the still-raw trauma of the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7 for Israelis â with hundreds of hostages still unaccounted for and families still mourning the dead, as well as the growing loss of civilian life and increasingly desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza â this satire was ill-timed, the subject poorly chosen and deeply insensitive and offensive.

At a time when antisemitism is soaring around the world and Israel is facing a serious existential threat from various regional actors in the Middle East â Hezbollah, Hamas and Iran among others â and when civilian lives are being lost both in Israel and Gaza, we would hope that the editors and writers of Hyperallergic would exercise greater caution and better judgment.Â  I hope youâll agree this satire was a mistake and pull these âstoriesâ from circulation immediately.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Greenblatt

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/daniel-haqiqatjou-what-you-need-know,"Daniel Haqiqatjou is an antisemite and conspiracy theorist who also spreads anti-LGBTQ+ and misogynistic rhetoric. He is the founder, editor-in-chief and contributor at the Muslim Skeptic, an online magazine that frequently elevates antisemitic tropes and antisemitic conspiracy theories under the guise of legitimate criticism of Israel or Jewish law.Â Â 

Â 

Haqiqatjou has praised Hamas and its October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel across his social media profiles and shared age-old antisemitic tropes about Jewish and Israeli influence over global politics, including the belief that âJews manipulate [Evangelical Christians] into serving the Zionist cause.â He has promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories, suggesting that Israel and the Mossad were behind the attacks.Â Â 
Â 
Haqiqatjou has broad exposure on social media, with more than 128,000 followers on X, 147,000 connections on Facebook and more than 30,000 subscribers to his Telegram channel. He appears in multiple videos uploaded to the Muslim Skepticâs YouTube and Rumble channels, which combined have more than 387,000 subscribers. Haqiqatjou regularly engages in debates about religion with Muslim and non-Muslim figures and is occasionally invited to speak on campuses and in mosques in the U.S. and around the world.Â Â 
Â 
Haqiqatjou describes himself as a defender of Muslims and Islam, but by manipulating scripture and out-of-context quotes by religious figures, he vilifies other religions, particularly Judaism and Hinduism. Further, he depicts Judaism as an adversary, asserting that ""no religion on earth is as hostile to Christianity and Islam as Judaism.â

In His Own Words

Reactions to the October 7 Massacre in Israel:

Haqiqatjou is a proud supporter of the 10/7 âal-Aqsa Floodâ massacre. The day after October 7, Haqiqatjou praised the attack by posting a picture of a paraglider on his social media âreferencing Hamasâs use of paragliders to infiltrate Israel and attack civilians. He also posted on his Telegram channel that supporting the massacre was a matter of religious obligation, saying, âA Muslim who condemns Oct 7 is a hypocrite and a traitor to Islam.â He argued that âif one were to criticize Hamas for anything, it would be for an overly soft and forgiving attitude towards genocide perpetrators.âÂ Â 

Screenshot: FacebookÂ 

Â 

In his efforts to legitimize the October 7 attacks and to promote vile conspiracy theories, Haqiqatjou denied rape accusations made by Israeli victims. He also denied that the Nova Festival massacre ever took place. On his X account, Haqiqatjou asserted that these two claims are a hoax perpetrated by the âUS-Israeli empireâ with the aim of promoting anti-Muslim hate: ""The U.S-Israeli empire constantly produces hoaxes and lies to generate hatred against the Muslim world (e.g, ...rape of Israeli ravers)."" In another instance, he posted a picture of Nova Festival attendees in hiding and wrote, ""They really expect people to believe this.""Â 

Haqiqatjou claims that âIsrael and its policy of apartheid and genocide"" is ""legitimized"" by ""racist and violent teachings in the Jewish religion,â specifically the Talmud. The Talmud is one of Judaismâs most sacred texts; antisemites frequently quote the text out of context to advance their antisemitic beliefs.Â Â 

Pushing Antisemitic Conspiracies:

Haqiqatjou promotes classic antisemitic tropes, which he disguises as criticism of the state of Israel and Zionism. Some of his posts claim that Israel and the Mossad are behind psychological warfare operations that are meant to serve the interests of Israel, including:Â Â 

Explicitly claiming that the Jewish financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein âworked for Israeli Mossad to videotape powerful figures raping children to create blackmail material, ensuring those figures acted in accordance w/ Israeli interests.âÂ Â 

Stating that the Islamic State terror organization was created by the Israeli intelligence to serve Israeli interests.Â Â 

Suggesting multiple times that Israel was behind the 9/11 attacks.Â Â 

Screenshot: TelegramÂ 

Â 

Haqiqatjou highlights individual cases of Jewish rabbis engaged in child molestation to allege that this phenomenon is intrinsic to Judaism. He argues that Jewish perpetrators get away with these actions because of their alleged influence. For example, in January 2024, in reaction to the antisemitic conspiracies circulating about the passageways located under the Chabad Headquarters in Brooklyn, NY, he posted: âThis is what some NYC Jews are doing in full view and approval of city officials [referring to the performance of the controversial metzitzah bâpeh ritual]. I wonder what they were doing that had to be hidden in secret tunnels.âÂ Â 

Misogynist Rhetoric:Â 

Haqiqatjou vehemently opposes feminism, which he blames for convincing women to beautify themselves for âstrange men,â an act that, in his view, âcauses literal pain for their husbands, fathers, sons, and other male family members.âÂ 

Screenshot: XÂ 

Â 

On his Telegram channel, he describes âthe modern womanâ as stupid and unaware of the putative societal rules that define her attractiveness, arguing that a womanâs attractiveness âdecreases with age;â âdecreases with the number of sexual partners sheâs had;â âdecreases if she has children from previous relationships;â âdoes not increase the more degrees she has or the higher her job title.âÂ Â 

Anti-LBGTQ Hate:Â 

Haqiqatjou wages a campaign on social media against the LGBTQ+ community, which he often refers to as âQawm Lutâ (translates from Arabic to âPeople of Lotââa derogatory term that originates from the story of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, who, according to some interpretations of religious scripture, engaged in homosexual acts). On his social media accounts, Haqiqatjou has spoken out against individuals he calls the âpro-LGBT degenerate[s],â who he believes are working against Islam.Â Â 

According to Haqiqatjou, the âtrans agenda,â being promoted by companies such as Starbucks, targets fathers with the goal of emasculating them. He elaborated on this viewpoint in a post shared on his Telegram channel: âNotice how this ad attacks the older fathers. They put the most pressure on the older father generation because that's who stands against such degeneracy. The goal is to transform all those fathers into simp cucks.""Â This he warns, is what happened to the American Muslim community: âMany religious Muslim men in the older generation (not liberals) have been brainwashed.â",,,

Chief Executive OfficerÂ 
TikTok Inc.Â Â 
5800 Bristol ParkwayÂ 
Culver City, California 90230
Â 

Dear Mr. Chew:

Since the October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel, social media platformsâ contributions to the proliferation of antisemitism and anti-Israel misinformation online have been deeply concerning.Â  Jewish content creators on TikTok and other platforms have been inundated with antisemitic comments, many to the point of leaving platforms entirely.

ADLâs most recent investigation found that bad actors are circumventing TikTokâ content moderation safeguards to spread vile and obvious antisemitism and to connect with their heinous fellow travelers on the platform.

Despite ADLâs research showing that harassment on TikTok has more than doubled since 2021, TikTok remains, for many, a black box. In 2021, ADL rated TikTokâ data accessibility an F - the worst among all platforms. While TikTok has introduced a tool allowing academic researchers to access data to understand the platform, at this moment more is required.

We, the undersigned individuals and organizations, demand TikTok take immediate action on these urgent issues of antisemitism on the platform by:

Submitting to an independent Antisemitism Audit by external experts on antisemitism
Implementing policy and design changes to better support targets of antisemitism and hate on the platform.
Expanding resources and training for TikTokâs Trust and Safety team around antisemitism

Below are the details of these actions.

1) Submit to an independent Antisemitism Audit by external experts on antisemitism

In 2018, Meta (then Facebook) brought in external parties to perform a Civil Rights Audit of the Facebook platform, which was released in 2020 following pressure brought to bear on the company from the Stop Hate for Profit coalition in a time of unprecedented racial unrest in the United States.

In this momentâwhen antisemitism is surging both in the United States and globally and there are many questions on TikTokâs role--the platform must similarly step up and be more transparent and accountable for how it is handling this surge as well as the experiences of its Jewish users. It is time for an independent Antisemitism Audit of TikTok.

The Audit would consist of a multi-faceted evaluation of TikTokâs content moderation practices around antisemitism including policy, enforcement, product and personnel support for targets of antisemitism by the foremost world experts on antisemitism, social media policy, and content moderation enforcement.

2) Support for Targets of Online Hate:

Many Jewish TikTok creators have been targeted with unrelenting antisemitism since October 7.Â  Earlier this year, the ADL Center for Tech and Society evaluated nine tech platforms on how they are supporting targets of online hate.Â  ADL rated TikTok a CÂ for their efforts to support targets.

For TikTok specifically to improve their support for targets of hate they must improve their efforts around communicating with targets of harassment, supporting users experiencing networked harassment campaigns, and muting features.

To improve support for targets of hate, TikTok should take these concrete steps:

Implement a reporting portal/ticketing system to keep targets of hate apprised of the status of their report to TikTok
Create a feature to allow trusted allies to be given delegate access to help moderate content for a particular user
Create a user-friendly way to allow users to easy mute other users who they may not want to see in their timeline
Provide real time support for targets of severe harassment on the platform

3) Expand resources and training to TikTokâs Trust and Safety team around antisemitism

The past year has shown social media companies on the retreat in terms of investment in their trust and safety teams. While TikTok has not conducted significant layoffs, they should further lean into resourcing their trust and safety teams, especially around antisemitism.

Make permanent the surged resources that TikTok announced as part of their response to the attacks on October 7. This would include the command center with key members of their safety teams and increased Hebrew and Arabic speaking moderators.
Expand the staffing and other resourcing of their trust and safety teams. Currently TikTok has 40,000 safety professionals and 1.7 billion monthly active users, making the ratio of staff to users 42,500 users to 1 safety staff. TikTok should resource to reduce this ratio significantly.
TikTok should expand its training programs to include modules on antisemitism from credible experts, so that all safety staff and moderators are conducting their work with an accurate and operational understanding of antisemitism.

The stakes are too high, and the public deserves to know how TikTok is protecting Jewish users and ensuring that antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiments are not being further inflamed, further endangering Jews around the world. TikTok must act now.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/israel-isis-and-other-lies-about-crocus-city-hall-terror-attack,"Conspiracy theories and antisemitic narratives have flooded social media in the wake of an Islamic State-claimed terror attack at a music venue outside Moscow.Â 

On March 22, 2024, four gunmen attacked concertgoers at Crocus City Hall, shooting into the crowd and using explosives to set the building on fire, killing at least 130 people and injuring at least 140 others.Â 

Hours after the attack, the Amaq News Agency, a propaganda arm of the Islamic State (IS or ISIS), claimed responsibility for the massacre on its Telegram channel. The post did not identify a specific IS cell, but U.S. officials believe it may be linked to the Islamic StateâKhorasan Province , often referred to as ISIS-K or just IS-K.Â 

Extremists and conspiracy theorists are denying IS carried out the attack, despite the groupâs claim of responsibility, the available evidence and their history of targeting and making threats against Russia. Instead, mis- and disinformation about the attack have run rampant, accusing a range of entities such as Jews, Israel, the CIA and Ukraine.Â 

Blaming JewsÂ Â 

Despite the preponderance of evidence that IS was responsible for the Moscow attack, extremists and conspiracy theorists have tried to claim that Jews are responsible for the deadly assault, echoing false narratives created in the wake of other significant terrorist attacks, as well as tropes that Jews have the power to manipulate global events.Â Â 

On X, antisemitic conspiracy theorist Daniel Haqiqatjou suggested a link between the timing of the attack and the Jewish holiday Purim, falsely stating it celebrates the mass murder of the âenemies of the Jews.â

Â 

On multiple white supremacist Telegram channels, members exchanged the conspiratorial belief that IS is secretly run by the CIA, and that the CIA is controlled by the Jews. These theories therefore imply that IS is a product of Jewish control.

Â 

A popular antisemitic influencer on X shared an offensive cartoon that incorporates the antisemitic âHappy Merchantâ to promote the false claim that Jews were actually responsible for the actions of IS in Moscow.

Â 

Blaming Israel or Mossad

Many alleged that IS is a direct product of Israel, sometimes weaponizing the acronym to call it the âIsraeli secret intelligence service.â In fact, from March 22 - March 24, 2024, there were over 59,000 mentions of the phrases âIsraeli secret intelligence serviceâ or âIsrael is ISISâ on X.

An X account called âSuppressed Voice,â which routinely amplifies Hamas propaganda and glorifies terrorism as a form of âresistance,â posted these conspiratorial sentiments alongside the false claim that Mossad is also an IS-affiliate.

Shortly after IS claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack, antisemitic influencer Lucas GageÂ  simply concluded, âSo it was Israelâ on X. Gage is a regular promoter of antisemitic, anti-Zionist and anti-Israel conspiracy theories.

Jake Shields, another popular antisemitic conspiracy theorist on X, also shared the statement âIsrael is ISIS,â using headlines that suggest past IS members were actually working with Mossad. Theories that Mossad created or backed IS are not new and are popular among promoters of anti-Israel disinformation.

Blaming the CIA

ConspiratorialÂ  far-right commentator Jackson Hinkle shared a variety of theories about the attack on his show, eventually concluding: âWe all know whoâs responsible for this terror attack. You can say Ukraine, you can say ISIS, you can say whoever, but we know itâs the CIA whoâs doing this stuff.â

Â 

On Telegram, social media influencer and QAnon promoter Jordan Sather shared a conspiracy theory that the attack âwas set up by rogue CIA elements.â Sather claimed the timing of the event was too âcoincidentalâ because it happened days after former President Barack Obama met with United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and because the date of the attack was ânumerologically significant.â Sather has a long history of promoting outlandish narratives and âfalse flagâ claims, including those about school shootings.

Â 

Blaming Ukraine

Many users incorporated pro-Russia/anti-Ukraine sentiments into their narratives, suggesting Ukraine was a co-conspirator working with IS, Israel and the CIA to carry out the Crocus City Hall attack.

A video shared by Lord Bebo, a popular X account known for promoting false and misleading content to over 358,000 followers, alleged that IS is a âCIA creation.â Lord Bebo also suggested the IS admission was âa cover up to deflect blame from Ukraine.â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/45th-anniversary-israel-egypt-peace-marks-critical-juncture-israel-arab,"The post-Oct. 7 Israel-Hamas war placed Arab normalization with Israel at a critical juncture like never before, risking past achievements, recent progress and future prospects.

First, the Oct. 7 massacre perpetrated by Hamas wasnât just an outburst of antisemitic hate by an Islamist terror organization seeking to exterminate Jews. It also served as a warning sign of the lengths to which the Islamic Republic of Iran and its proxies would go in order to thwart the prospects of Israeli normalization efforts, including with Saudi Arabia for which the basic framework was, according to senior US officials, in the works right before the Hamas attack.

Emboldened by the Iranian regime, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis of Yemen are now united in their efforts to form a strategic stranglehold around Israel to block any new moderate alliances from forming in the region.

Second, the current war has had a corrosive effect on Israelâs longstanding peace treaties with both Egypt and Jordan.

The mass flight of Gazans to Egyptâs border and the impending Israeli military action in Rafah has Egypt concerned at the Â specter of Palestinian evacuees fleeing into Egypt and violating its sovereignty.

While these peace treaties have not generated a strong people-to-people (p2p) engagement, they have been a stabilizing element for the region. The above mentioned developments â along with the already rampant anti-Israel sentiment in both Egypt and Jordan â pose a concrete threat to the monumental achievements Israelâs peace treaties with its Arab neighbors represent.

Third, the raging antisemitism worldwide, including featured in Arab media, as well as attempts by Muslim world leaders to fan the flames of hatred, all risk rolling back the incremental progress made in recent years, mainly in the form of the Abraham Accords. Anti-Israel rallies have already taken place in Bahrain and in Morocco, an unusal occurance in those countries.

This perfect storm necessitates responsible leadership, moral clarity and diplomatic prudence on the part of Israel, its Arab allies and the international community as a whole.

As Israel exercises its right to self-defense in the aftermath of Oct. 7, it must continue to work to safeguard its existing peace treaties as the strategic assets they are. Notably, the UAE and Bahrain both remain committed to the Accords, and indications are that Saudi Arabia might be open to normalizing ties with Israel under certain conditions.

On their part, Jordan and Egypt would be wise to view their alliance with Israel as the key to any moderate coalition against the aggression of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its proxies, and be fully cognizant of the benefits their peace with Israel entail for them. Â 

Finally, both those countries shouldnât suffice with a so-called âcold peaceâ with Israel, but rather look to countries like the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco, where a warmer, p2p focused peace, has become a staple of the relationship. One example of this was last yearâs establishment the Manara Center in Abu Dhabi (of which ADL is a flagship partner), which works to promote coexistence initiatives across the region. While governmental level engagement and security cooperation are certainly important, Egyptian and Jordanian ties with Israel would also benefit from this type of p2p engagement, Â leading to warmer and more meaningful cross-societal relationships.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-demands-action-following-antisemitic-incidents-university-michigan,"New York, NY, March 26th, 2024: The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today wrote a letter to the University of Michigan President, Santa J. Ono, Ph.D., condemning two recent antisemitic incidents on University of Michiganâs Ann ArborÂ campus. ADL is calling for immediate action to address violations of the student code of conduct and ensure that future University events can proceed without disruption.Â Â 

In the first incident on Friday, March 22,Â a University of Michigan student stated on Instagram,Â âUntil my last breath I will utter death to every single individual who supports the Zionist state. Death and more. Death and worse.âÂ The University, understanding the severity of the threat to the Jewish community, increased security patrols on campus.Â Â Yet it appears that no further action has been taken and this student is still part of the campus community.Â Â Â 

In a separate incident on Sunday, March 24, the Universityâs Honors Convocation was abruptly ended due to disturbances by anti-Israel protestors. The ceremony, honoring hundreds of students with their families in attendance, was halted during President Onoâs remarks. While similar incidents have warranted removal of disruptive parties by security, the UniversityÂ instead abruptly ended the ceremony.Â Â 

These episodes are just the latest in a string of unanswered incidents of antisemitism on the University of Michiganâs Ann Arbor campus.Â Over the past few months, students on campus â in some instances led byÂ the University of MichiganâsÂ SJP chapter, SAFE UMichÂ â have stormed the administration building, run for student government on platforms of intense anti-ZionismÂ and disrupted classes in the Ross Business School multiple times.Â Â 

âWhat should have been a joyous moment for families and students to celebrate academicÂ achievements was instead turned into a stomach-churning display ofÂ anti-Zionist fervor, enabled by the Universityâs inaction,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âAt a time when antisemitismÂ is snowballing on campus, colleges and universities have an obligation to protect Jewish students from intimidation,Â harassment, and violence. The University of Michigan has failed to do so over the last few months, with the event on Sunday impacting Jewish and non-Jewish families alike. They mustÂ act immediately to prevent further disruption andÂ harmto the entire campus community.âÂ 

Since October 7, ADL has recorded a surge ofÂ antisemitic incidents on college and university campuses. In addition,Â 73% of Jewish college students surveyed have experienced or witnessed some form of antisemitism since the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year alone. A plurality of Jewish college students reported that they do not feel physically safe on campus after October 7th, and even fewer feel emotionally safe. In an effort to protect the safety, wellbeing and civil rights of Jewish students, ADL launched theÂ Not On My Campus campaign to demand that U.S. colleges and universities commit to No Tolerance for Antisemitism. The Not On My Campus campaign offers a clear call to action for university and college leaders to commit to NoÂ Tolerance for antisemitism on their campuses and meet their moral and legal obligations to provide safe, inclusive and equitable learning environments for all students.Â 

This campaign is the latest action ADL has taken to make colleges and universities safer for Jewish students. In November, ADL, Hillel International, the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and Gibson and Dunn & Crutcher LLP announced the launch of theÂ Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL), a free legal protection helpline for students, family, faculty, and staff members to report incidents of antisemitic discrimination, intimidation, harassment, vandalism, or violence that may necessitate legal action.Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/us-white-supremacist-propaganda-incidents-reach-historic-levels-2023,"New York, NY, March 26, 2024 â¦ White supremacist propaganda distribution reached historic levels across the United States in 2023, with a total of 7,567 incidents, a 12-percent increase from 2022, according to the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Center on Extremismâs annual assessment. With an average of about 20 incidents per day, 2023 marked the highest level of incidents since ADL began tracking such data in 2017. This was the second consecutive year that ADL has recorded record-breaking propaganda numbers, illustrating a troubling trend that coincides with other data showing that antisemitism and other forms of hate are on the rise.

Specifically, antisemitic propaganda increased by 30 percent in 2023, rising to 1,112 incidents in 2023 from 852 in 2022. This increase was largely due to the white supremacist groupÂ Patriot Front reincorporating antisemitic phrases into their propaganda. It was also buoyed by online reactions to the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, asÂ white supremacist leaders applauded the terrorist group and violence against Israelis.

Additionally, anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda by white supremacists saw a massive 141-percent increase, jumping from 68 incidents in 2022 to 164 in 2023.

âAt a time when antisemitic sentiment and incidents are at historic levels, white supremacists are increasingly resorting to hate propaganda to spread pernicious ideas against Jews and other marginalized groups,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âHardly a day goes by without communities being targeted by this odious rhetoric that terrorizes and harasses people at increasingly disturbing rates. This growing threat reminds us we must stay committed to the fight against all forms of hate.â

The ADL Center on Extremism data includes the distribution of racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBTQ+ fliers, stickers, banners, graffiti, posters and laser projections by members of various white supremacist groups. While more than 50 different white supremacist groups and networks distributed propaganda, three of them âÂ Patriot Front,Â National Justice Party (NJP) andÂ Goyim Defense League (GDL)Â Â â were responsible for 92 percent of the activity.

In 2023, white supremacist propaganda was reported in the District of Columbia and every U.S. state except Hawaii and Alaska, with the highest levels of activity (from most to least active) in Virginia, Texas, California, New York, Massachusetts, Missouri, Tennessee, Michigan, Maryland and North Carolina. This yearâs assessment includes a citizenâs toolkit for responding to hate propaganda, which provides information and guidance for responding to any encounters with hate propaganda in a safe and positive way.

There were 282 documented white supremacist events in 2023, a 63-percent increase from the 173 recorded in 2022. Events took place in 40 states, with the most activity (from most to least active) in Texas, Ohio, Washington, Florida, California, Michigan and Tennessee.

Key findings from ADLâs 2023 assessment include:Â 

White supremacists sharply focused their hate on the LGBTQ+ community in 2023. More than 20 percent of white supremacist events included some element of anti-LGBTQ+ hate. On at least 39 occasions, white supremacists demonstrated outside LGBTQ+ event venues including drag shows and Pride festivals.
For the fourth straight year, the number of overall propaganda incidents on college campuses dropped, from 219 to 59, the lowest since ADL began tracking campus incidents in 2017.
For the fifth year in a row, Texas-basedÂ Patriot Front was responsible for the vast majority â 60 percent â of the propaganda distributions in 2023. The group distributed propaganda in every state except Alaska, Delaware and Hawaii, but was most active (from most to least active) in Virginia, Massachusetts, Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri.
Not previously known for distributing propaganda, the virulently antisemiticÂ National Justice Party (NJP) launched an aggressive propaganda campaign in 2023, and was responsible for at least 1,924 propaganda incidents, roughly 25 percent of the total propaganda activity nationwide.
TheÂ Goyim Defense League (GDL), an antisemitic network with significant crossover with other white supremacist groups and movements, was responsible for at least 511 propaganda incidents in 2023, representing roughly 7 percent of the total propaganda nationwide and 46 percent of the yearâs antisemitic propaganda incidents. This is a slight increase from the 492 GDL propaganda incidents recorded in 2022.

""ADL has been documenting incidents of white supremacist propaganda in the United States since 2017 and we have never before seen such levels of activity,"" said Oren Segal, Vice President for the Center on Extremism. ""In addition - the hateful messages pushed by such propaganda are as diverse as their targets. That's why our citizen's toolkit, Responding to Hate Propaganda: What You Need to Know, includes step-by-step instructions on what to do when you see hateful propaganda in your hometown, so you can safely document these incidents and help protect your community.""

The incidents referenced in this report and other extremist activity across the country are detailed in theÂ ADL H.E.A.T. Map, which tracks incidents of hate and violence nationwide.

All young people should be able to feel safe, included and respected in their classrooms and schools. Unfortunately, many do not. A recent study of high school students found that nearly four in ten students experienced identity-based bullying or bullying related to an aspect of their identity such as race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or physical appearance.Â Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/adl-guidance-public-officials-ceasefire-resolutions,"Since the horrific Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 and the ensuing war in Gaza with a large humanitarian toll, there are intensifying calls for an immediate ceasefire.

We are supportive of ongoing diplomatic efforts, led by the U.S. and regional leaders, to negotiate a mutually agreed-to pause in fighting that would include the release of all the hostages, humanitarian assistance for the civilians of Gaza, and the end to the threat posed by Hamas to the people of Israel and Gaza. Â All of this, we hope, will ultimately create conditions that could lead to a sustainable resolution to the conflict with peace, security and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians alike. Â 

At the same time, we have seen many highly problematic ceasefire resolutions considered by city councils, legislatures and other bodies. Â Specifically, many of these resolutions:
Downplay, fail to condemn or even mention Hamasâs atrocities on October 7, including murder, brutalization, sexual violence and kidnapping;
Diminish the plight of the hostages being held in Gaza or fail to call for the immediate release of all hostages, including the bodies being held by Hamas;Â 
Place the entire onus of this current war, and the entirety of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, on Israel;
Utilizing demonizing language about Israel and Zionism, and include false and incendiary accusations about Israel;
Ignoring the ongoing threats posed by Hamas to Israel, as well as Hamasâ track-record of breaking ceasefire agreements.Â 

Another concern is that many hearings and public comments on these resolutions across the country have featured shocking antisemitic rhetoric directed at Jews and Zionists, creating a hostile environment surrounding these actions, including for many in attendance at the hearings. This is happening at a time when Jews in the United States and around the world, are confronting an unprecedented level of antisemitism.

The reality is this war, and the humanitarian crisis confronting Gazan civilians, could end today were Hamas to release all hostages, disarm and disband, end its rule of Gaza and free the civilians it purposefully puts in danger. Â 

We urge public officials to keep these concerns in mind as they consider such resolutions.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/men-going-their-own-way-mgtow-what-you-need-know,"Part of the ADL Center on Extremismâs coverage of the misogynist manosphere and its subcultures, each of which impacts womenâs experiences of safety and equity â online and offline.â¯Â 

Â 

Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) is a distinct faction of the âmanosphere,â the broad set of male supremacist, anti-feminist, misogynist and sometimes violent extremist movements that exist largely online. The MGTOW movement began online in the early 2000s when bloggers drafted manifestos outlining their desire for men to separate themselves from women and form a single-gender society.Â Â 

Â 

MGTOWs isolate themselves from all women as well as anyone else who advocates for or defends feminism. The primary threat posed by MGTOWs comes from their dangerous and disingenuous antifeminist rhetoric, including lies about the nature & consequences of feminism, the reality of discrimination faced by women and the impact of cultural feminism on men. This vitriolic and separatist position reinforces men's existing misogynist beliefs, which contributes to existing cultures of misogyny and jeopardizes womenâs safety.Â Â 
Â 

For decades, social scientists have studied the ways in which deviants and deviant subcultures respond to changes in social norms. One of the most popular frameworks used to evaluate and categorize subcultures is Robert Mertonâs typology of deviance, first published in 1938, which recognizes separatist movements like MGTOWs as a deviant response by a subculture whose values are fundamentally incompatible with the central (existing) culture.Â 

Core Beliefs of the MGTOW MovementÂ 

The core tenets of the MGTOW subculture have been a popular object of study for social scientists since their emergence into the public consciousness in the mid 2010âs. Scholars like Shawn Van Valkenburgh have focused their research careers on all elements of the manosphere, including MGTOWs, whereas other teams of researchers, such as the team led by Scott Wright, focused their efforts exclusively on understanding the MGTOW phenomenon. Their findings, and those of scholars like them, are summarized below:Â 

MGTOWs believe modern âWesternâ society has been corrupted by feminism. MGTOWs especially blame third-wave feminism, which is characterized by its attention to the intersectionality of misogyny, sex and body positivity, and its focus on redefining traditional gender roles for both men and women.

MGTOWs argue that feminism ensures that men are either actively subjected to (or at serious risk of) discrimination, because modern society is too focused on women (versus men). Their âproofâ is what they term double standards evident in the workplace, legal rulings and dating.Â 

In response to this perceived societal demise, MGTOWs advocate for men to withdraw completely from society, to minimally interact with women, men who do not share their positions, and any culture they perceive as feminist.

MGTOWs perceive all people and cultures as feminist until proven otherwise- their separatist behaviors stem from a paranoid, defensive posture in which everyone who isnât with them is against them, and everyone who is against them poses a direct threat.Â Â 

Stages and Degrees of SeparatismÂ 

Â 

Individuals may adopt the MGTOW ideology for any number of reasons, but several common precursors include being rejected by women, being subjected to perceived discrimination or unrealistic male beauty standards and shifting cultural norms. Those who embrace MGTOW culture often have increased anxiety around what they see as ever-changing ârulesâ around so-called âpolitical correctnessâ or âwokeâ behaviors, which may be reinforced when they are reprimanded, shamed or otherwise punished for their misogynistic behaviors and/or comments.Â 

MGTOW separation ideology is categorized into four distinct levels:Â 

The first level, known as ""the red pill,"" signifies awareness of feminist âcorruptionâ without necessarily changing one's opinions or behaviors.Â 

The second level, referred to as ""the purple pill,"" involves rejecting relationships, cohabitation, and marriage with women while still participating in shorter-term relationships.

The third level encompasses a complete rejection of all forms of social interactions with women.

The final level involves complete detachment from society, including employment and all social interactions with non-MGTOWs.Â 

Movement Growth and PopularityÂ 

Â 

MGTOW groups experienced substantial growth in the early to mid-2010s, driven largely by the proliferation of memes and testimonials by members, who criticized perceived âfeminist corruption.âÂ 

Â 

In 2014, prominent political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos wrote an article for Breitbart describing the behaviors associated with MGTOWs- individual men retreating from society and embracing digital socialization, substance abuse, video games, and internet pornography instead of culturally accepted pastimes and pursuits. Following the publication of the article, Google Trends data for terms like âMGTOWsâ, âMen Going Their Own Wayâ and âSexodusâ shows a strong correlation between the Breitbart piece and the rise in popularity of these terms online â leading to increased visibility and popularity of the MGTOW movement. Dr. Angela Nagleâs 2017 book, âKill All Normiesâ, which explored the digital emergence of the alt right, cites the Breitbart article as an example of how a popular alt-right figure (Yiannopoulos) exposed a broad readership to a range of misogynist beliefs.Â 

Â 

Simultaneously, social scientists in the 2010s began writing about MGTOW movements as part of broader academic exploration into the manosphere. By 2020, numerous academic papers had been published on MGTOWs and the manosphere, highlighting MGTOWsâ presence on platforms like Reddit and as influencers on social media sites. Some of these communities and individuals were banned from these platforms, including the subreddit r/MGTOW, which was removed in 2021.Â 

Â 

Current StateÂ 

Despite these bans and the disappearance of many MGTOW websites and communities, a few continue to operate today, including the imageboard known as Wizardchan, where MGTOWs discuss their ideology, mental health, hobbies and more. Users in these communities frequently employ misogynistic language, including the use of derogatory terms to describe women, and engage in other forms of hate, including racism and homophobia.

MGTOW Violence and Plots (North America, Europe and New Zealand)

April 2025 â Owen âOzâ Lawrence, Headingsley, Leeds, England

On April 26, 2025, Owen âOzâ Lawrence carried out an attack using a BB gun and a crossbow in the Headingley suburb of Leeds, England, that injured two women. Following his assault, Lawrence died due to complications from a self-inflicted injury.

About an hour before the attack, Lawrence posted detailed plans, targets, and inspirations for his action on Facebook. Earlier, in February 2025, he self-identified online as a MGTOW. Lawrence also made Facebook posts detailing feminist concepts & ideas he disliked/hated, which included âgender equality,â âfeminists of all four waves,â âfeminoids,â and âfemale empowerment.â

Â 

InfluencersÂ Â 

Â 

While there is no singular voice representing MGTOWs on the internet, several alt-right and manosphere influencers produce content that promotes MGTOW ideology, including H. Pearl Davis, 21 Studios, SandmanMGTOW and ManospherePodcast. These creators wield significant influence, reaching millions of viewers and shaping public perceptions of feminism and the MGTOW ideology.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/tiktok-ban-feared-antisemitic-conspiracy-theories-follow,"On March 13, 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that could potentially lead to a nationwide ban of the popular social media platform TikTok.

According to the bill, the issue stems from TikTok being owned by a âforeign adversary,â which poses a national security threat. TikTokâs China-owned parent company ByteDance would be required to find another buyer within six months to avoid the app being pulled from app stores in the US. While the bill has not yet made its way through the Senate, President Biden said that he intends to sign it if it lands on his desk.

Soon after the news broke about the House passage, influencers and extremists from across the political spectrum began framing the bill as an outright ban and speculating that the bill is a product of Jewish or Zionist influence, calling it an effort to infringe on free speech by limiting the reach of pro-Palestinian content.

Conspiratorial claims about Jewish influence in the media are nothing new, dating back to the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, one of the most notorious and egregious antisemitic texts of the early 20th century. Allegations of Zionist media control are also widespread on both the far-right and the far-left, on social media and at demonstrationsâmost recently, at protests against the Israel-Hamas war. In the wake of the TikTok bill, these narratives have resurfaced to focus on three targets: Jews, Israel and Zionist organizations.

Claims targeting JewsÂ 

Antisemites and extremists are claiming that the TikTok bill is further evidence of powerful Jews silencing dissenting voices, invoking a classic trope about Jewish control.Â 
Â 
On Gab, antisemitic influencer Lucas Gageâwho has recently capitalized on the Israel-Hamas war to spread conspiracy theories about Jews and Zionismâargued that âJews are getting desperate,â and that their âopen war on Tik Tok is only increasing awareness of their power.â

Â 

Claims targeting IsraelÂ 

A popular claim from both the left and right is that Israel is exercising its allegedly disproportionate power by trying to ban TikTok and limiting the proliferation of pro-Palestine content.

Influencer and streamer Haz Al-Din, also known as âInfrared,â claimed on X that banning TikTok is not about China, but rather about giving âcontrol to Israel in the interest of âthe Zionist lobby.ââ

Â 

Others have alleged that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is also responsible for the proposed ban. This narrative surfaced after some users cited OpenSecrets data that listed AIPAC donations to Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), who spearheaded the bill. A popular conspiracy theorist on TikTok used this claim to suggest that Israel and Mossad are influencing the governmentâs decisions about TikTok, highlighting that the bill was introduced by a man whose âtop contributions are coming from Zionists.""

Â 

There is no evidence that AIPAC was involved with the creation of the bill itself. Also, AIPACâs recent congressional summit on Capitol Hill discussed a range of lobbying effortsânone of which had to do with the TikTok bill. At the time of this writing, AIPAC has not yet commented publicly on the potential TikTok ban.Â 
Â 
Claims targeting Zionist organizations

Antisemites and anti-Zionist influencers have cited organizations who call out TikTok for antisemitism on its platform as âevidenceâ that Zionist organizations control the narrative about the Israel/Palestine conflict on social media. This includes the Jewish Federations of North America, who publicly lauded the passage of the recent TikTok bill.Â 
Â 
ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) has condemned antisemitic and anti-Zionist content on TikTok in the past. Promoters have falsely claimed that this public criticism, including statements from ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, confirms that the organization is complicit in trying to get the platform banned.Â 
Â 
On his show, antisemitic conspiracy theorist Stew Peters used the claim to support a bigoted, nonsensical rant about Jewish control, arguing that âZionist shakedown crews like the ADLâ are promoting legislation against TikTok because the platform âallows its users to question Israel.â

Â 

Others have cited what they call âleaked audioâ of Greenblatt, who was noting the proliferation of anti-Zionist rhetoric among younger generations on platforms like TikTok. In fact, Greenblatt made those remarksÂ  during a public zoom call that was later posted online by the Tehran Times, an Iranian regime mouthpiece, which mischaracterized the remarks as private and âleaked.â

Notably, ADL regularly points out gaps in content moderation practices on social media platforms, including but not limited to TikTok, and works to provide insight and recommendations on how to address them. In a March 13 statement, ADL encouraged legislation and action to help curb hate on TikTok and called for the platform to allow more accessibility to researchers.Â 

Greenblatt has also publicly acknowledged the significance of TikTok as a news outlet for young people on social media, urging the platformâs owners and stakeholders to âtake actionâ in making meaningful improvements. These calls-to-action have not included an outright ban of the platform.",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-unveils-new-online-antisemitism-course-middle-and-high-school-students,"New York, NY, March 19, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today unveiled an innovative and comprehensive new online learning experience on antisemitism for middle and high school student groups. The course,Â Awareness to Action: Challenging AntisemitismÂ is designed to unravel the complexities of antisemitism and to empower the next generation to challenge bias in all forms.

The four-part digital course, which is available free of charge to schools, includes four learning modules that can each be completed in 30 minutes or less. The individual modules include âExploring Jewish Identity,â âRecognizing Antisemitism,â âChallenging Antisemitismâ and âChampioning Justice.â

âNow more than ever, our nationâs students need to be equipped with the tools to recognize and challenge antisemitism when faced with it online, in their schools and in their communities,â said Clara Hess, ADL Vice President of Education.

The new course comes at a time when antisemitic incidents have reached historic levels across the United States, on college campuses and in K-12 schools. Between Oct. 7, 2023 and Feb. 20, 2024, ADL recorded a total of 5,590 antisemitic incidents across the U.S., a 331 percent increase year over year. At non-Jewish K-12 schools, ADL has tracked 450 antisemitic incidents across the country, a 107 percent increase over the 217 incidents during the same time frame a year ago.

âEducators play an important role in shaping the perspectives of their students,â Hess added. âOur new course gives teachers the tools to dispel myths and stereotypes and to foster a deeper understanding of antisemitism and bias in the classroom and beyond.â

Awareness to Action builds a comprehensive learning arc, with each lesson building on the last one for a holistic understanding of antisemitism.

Participants in the interactive digital learning experience hear directly from Jewish students who provide authentic perspectives. The course features stories, photos, videos, checks for understanding, reflection questions and scenarios. An Educator Guide is included to support implementation of the learning experience and educators also will receive access to recommended professional learning and extension activities.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/anti-israel-protesters-use-international-womens-day-praise-female-terrorists,"Friday, March 8, 2024, marked the annual commemoration of International Womenâs Day. Over the weekend of March 8â10, anti-Israel activists nationwide used the occasion to celebrate female Palestinian terrorists, including glorifying individuals affiliated with recognized terrorist organizations and whose acts of anti-Israel violence have included bombings, plane hijackings and more.

Â 

As previously noted by ADL, in the months since Hamasâs October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, anti-Israel protests in the United States have often featured speakers or attendees who endorse groups that the US recognizes asâ¯Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)â¯orâ¯Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs)â¯â includingâ¯Hamas,â¯Hezbollah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Houthis (Ansar Allah). Protesters have also glorified notorious leaders of these groups, includingâ¯Leila Khaled.

Â 

Khaled again featured prominently at anti-Israel demonstrations celebrating International Womenâs Day. In New York City on March 8, a banner dropped over a highway in the Bronx featured an image of Khaled and the slogan âFrom the Bronx to Gaza: women demand liberation.â In Albuquerque, NM, also on March 8, multiple protesters held signs with the slogan âA womenâs [sic] place is in the intifadah,â alongside a photo of Khaled holding a gun. Intifadah (or intifada) is a reference to two periods â in the late 1980s and early 2000s â during which Palestinian terrorists committed indiscriminate acts of violence against Israelis, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people.

An International Womenâs Day rally in New Orleans, LA, on March 9 included multiple speakers who glorified acts of violent, women-led terrorism against Israel as admirable so-called âresistance.â Standing in front of a banner with the slogan âVictory to the Palestinian resistanceâ and images of Khaled and PFLP Secretary General Ahmad Saâadat, a speaker affiliated with the local Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) chapter said, âTo this day, one cannot celebrate the heroic feats of Palestiniansâ armed struggle without recognizing the role of Palestinian women in that struggle.âÂ 

Â 

Another speaker at the New Orleans protest praised Palestinian women who are âjoining the resistance and taking up arms.â Drawing cheers from the crowd, the speaker went on to specifically celebrate âthe womenâs unit of the National Resistance Brigades, standing strong, who are part of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] as the military wing.â The National Resistance Brigades are one of the groups that reportedly participated in the October 7 attack against Israel alongside Hamas.Â 

Protesters carry a banner glorifying Fatima Bernawi at an International Womenâs Day protest in Los Angeles, CA on March 8, 2024.

Protesters in Los Angeles, CA, praised Fatima Bernawi, who in 1967 was arrested and convicted after attempting to bomb a movie theater in Israel. On March 8, protesters carried a banner depicting Bernawi with a reference to the âFatima Bernawi brigade.â That same day, in Columbus, OH, a speaker praised âwomen leadersâ of Palestine, referencing both Bernawi and Khaled by name. On March 10, at an International Womenâs Day march in Chicago, IL, a protester carried a sign that read âCelebrate revolutionary women!â and listed names including Bernawi and Khaled.

Â 

In Grand Rapids, MI on March 10, a speaker affiliated with the local FRSO chapter praised Rasmea Odeh, a PFLP terrorist convicted for her role in a 1969 supermarket bombing in Jerusalem that killed two Israeli students and injured nine others. âWe should celebrate her resistance,â the speaker stated, adding that âOdeh is familiar to millions of Palestinians who have not given up organizing for their rights to resistance, equality and return.â The Grand Rapids protest also featured a sign depicting Leila Khaled.Â 

Protesters hold a sign depicting Leila Khaled at the âRally for International Womenâs Day: Stand with the Women of Palestineâ event in Grand Rapids, MI on March 10, 2024.Â 

Another PFLP member, Khalida Jarrar, was referenced on signs and in speakersâ comments at an International Womenâs Day event in San Francisco, CA on March 8. A speaker praised âthe work ofâ¦leaders like Khalida Jarrar, who remain steadfast despite being unlawfully detained and tortured.â

Â 

In Washington, DC on March 8, a speaker affiliated with the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) read part of a prepared statement from the group: âWe unite not just in commemoration, but in powerful resistance. Our struggle echoes the enduring spirit of Palestinian women who have resisted and continue to resist colonialism, imperialism and Zionism for generations.â The speaker added, âwe honor our women who have been on the frontlines of the struggle for our peopleâs liberation,â naming Israa Jaabis â who injured an Israeli police officer in 2015 when she detonated a car bomb â as an example of one of these praiseworthy women.Â 

A protester carries a sign that celebrates Palestinian women, including convicted terrorists Leila Khaled and Fatima Bernawi, at an International Womenâs Day march in Chicago, IL, on March 10, 2024.Â 

In addition to the rhetoric used at on-the-ground protests, anti-Israel activists also expressed their support for female Palestinian terrorists in social media statements about International Womenâs Day. The Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) released a âWomen in Resistanceâ statement on March 8 that said, in part, âPalestinian women have been essential to active resistance against the British Mandate and Zionism, dedicating their lives to the Palestinian struggle across decades.â On Instagram, PYM captioned the post with an additional comment that explicitly named the First and Second Intifada as examples of periods in which Palestinian women have â[upheld] our struggle against our oppressor.âÂ

The Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) released a similar statement for International Womenâs Day, saying that the group âwould like to emphasize showing solidarity with the brave and courageous women of Palestine as they fight not only for their own lives, but for the lives of their families and all the people of Palestine struggling against Zionist oppression...[FRSO] rejects proposed half-measures like the âtwo state solutionâ and proudly declares: âFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!ââ A poster accompanying the FRSO statement featured images of Khaled and Bernawi.",,,

Global Editor in Chief

Brad Dayspring
Executive Vice President,
Global Communications and Brand


Dear Mr. DÃ¶pfner, Mr. Harris and Mr. Dayspring:

We were deeply concerned by Politicoâs decision to publish a highly offensive political cartoon by Matt Wuerker, depicting a âpunch cardâ suggesting that Israel and Jews are using âcenturies of pogroms, antisemitism and the Holocaustâ as their âfree passâ â presumably to wage war against the Palestinian people in Gaza.

Wuerkerâs cartoon âPunch Cardâ is misleading and offensive in several ways.

First, it is objectionable to suggest there is no connection to the history of antisemitism and the struggle that Israel is facing in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas, the deadliest assault on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Without making direct analogies, what Hamas did on Oct. 7, and what they stand for, as reflected in their antisemitic charter, are very much in line with that tragic history of anti-Jewish violence. To turn that around and imply that now it is Israel committing such acts, without this recognition, is abhorrent.

Furthermore, to suggest that Israel is getting a free pass because of past Jewish suffering is transparently absurd, especially considering the explosion of criticism and protests and antisemitic attacks that have emerged post-Oct. 7. What should disturb the cartoonist and others is not any fictitious passÂ that Israel is receiving, but rather that immediately after the massacre on Oct. 7, many incredibly blamed Israel for the Hamas atrocities.

Perhaps more accurate would have been a cartoon depicting how Oct. 7 and its aftermath are unfortunately the modern-day form of Jew hatred that has its precedents in centuries of antisemitism, pogroms, and the Holocaust.

At best, the cartoonist misses this continuity; at worst, his cartoon gives Hamas and terrorism a pass and deceives those who view this cartoon into forgetting about the most depraved and inhumane details of Hamas attack, namely the intentional murder of innocent men, women, and children, which started this most recent conflict.Â 

Whatâs more, Mr. Dayspringâs defense of his cartoon in Jewish Insider as âthe opinions of the authorâ and not those of your publication is unconvincing. While we understand that political cartoonists are often given leeway to provoke their audience, thereâs a fine line between what is simply confrontational and ideas that are founded in conspiratorial antisemitism, and your editors have a choice in deciding which cartoons to use and which to reject. In this case, the cartoon is playing into conspiratorial notions that are often parroted by Holocaust deniers â the notion that Jews and Israel can get away with things because they use historical antisemitism and the Holocaust to gain sympathy for their so-called nefarious deeds.

I look forward to your response here and am available to speak by phone at any time to further clarify these concerns.


Sincerely,

Jonathan A. Greenblatt

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/hizb-ut-tahrir-us-conference-features-antisemitism-calls-violent-destruction,"The U.S. wing of Hizb Ut Tahrir, an international Islamist organization that seeks to establish an Islamic theocracy, held their annual conference on March 2, 2024, in Villa Park, Illinois.Â Â 

The group, which is banned in the United Kingdom, Germany and several other countries, featured speakers who called for an army to invade and destroy Israel, justified the October 7 Hamas terror attack, suggested men should travel to Gaza to fight Israel, implored followers to âresistâ the âLGBT genderism...agenda driven by the UNâ and, in several cases, espoused overt antisemitic rhetoric.Â Â 

The event was livestreamed on Rumble, a streaming platform favored by extremists for its self-professed âfree speechâ values and lack of content moderation.Â Â 

Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism

In a segment called âGaza: The Role of Muslims in America,â speaker Samer Abu Omar evoked several antisemitic tropes around Jews, âZionistsâ or Israel controlling money, media and/or politics. Though he claimed his issues are not with Jews â but instead with Israel or âZionistsâ â he failed to acknowledge how both are inherently tied to Jewish identity.Â Â 

When discussing President Bidenâs handling of the Israel-Hamas war, Abu Omar asked the audience to âexposeâ the âJewish... Israeli... Zionist narrative of Palestine.â

Abu Omar questioned the roots of Americaâs support for Israel, suggesting it is underpinned by profit motive and corporate greed:Â Â 

âStop the puppet politicians from dragging your sons and daughters into the battle for nothing but for dollar signs. ... What's in for America to keep supporting the genocide in Gaza? There is nothing but dollar signs for the corporate greed.âÂ Â 

He then addressed âthe Jewish community,â declaring that Jews should reject âthe Zionist illusion,â warning that it would âbring you nothing but destruction.âÂ Â 

Calls for an Army to Invade and Eradicate Israel

In a video clip shared during the conference, a small crowd of women can be seen protesting in an unknown location with two banners, one of which read âCalling the Muslim Armies to Liberate Palestine.â Between chants, one of the women called for a ""brave army"" of Muslims from around the world to eradicate Israel:Â 

âUnited in one voice, one call for our brothers, fathers, sons in the Muslim armies to rise to the Islamic duty...of liberating every inch of the entire blessed land of Palestine from this murderous occupation.â

âThe only thing that could confront a genocidal force and seven decades of terror suffered by the Muslims of Palestine is a brave army with soldiers...âÂ 

âWhat can stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by this racist Zionist entity and return them to their homeland except the uprooting of every inch of this brutal occupation by an Islamic army that understands its Islamic duty to liberate the entire land of Palestine?âÂ 

During his speech, Abu Omar also strongly suggested listeners use their âpower...and abilitiesâ to physically fight against Israel, and, barring that, should use their voices.Â 

Downplaying and Distorting October 7

At multiple points during the conference, speaker Osman Bakhach, the former head of Hizb Ut Tahrirâs international media office, alleged infants were not murdered on October 7 and blamed America and Europe for the Hamas attack.Â 

âThe pro-genocide people â the pro-Zionist people â to them history began on October 7: âOh look, Hamas attacked us. Look, they killed, they murdered, they raped, they beheaded babiesâ... Well, how about October 6th or 5? ... They don't want to talk about that. This is the tip of the iceberg. This issue of October 7th is no more than the tip of the iceberg.""

âEurope created the problem, but they don't want you to talk about it. They want to deceive you by blaming: âOh Hamas attacked us. Look at what Hamas did. Look, look, look October 7th! They murdered babies, they beheaded babies.â All of these lies, lies, lies related and relayed by MSM [mainstream media] media, New York Times, Washington Post, what have you, CNN, etc.âÂ 

Queerphobia and Misogyny

Bakhach also employed homophobia in a call to âresist and fightâ Muslim leaders who are âslavesâ to the West, alleging that leaders of Muslim-majority countries are âworking day and night to speed up the westernization and secularization of the Muslim societies, including lately recently the issue of LGBT and genderism.â¦ We have to be fully aware of it, and we have to resist it and fight it.âÂ 

Â 

Sheik Muhammed Shirazi, the director of an Islamic center in Chicago, spoke mockingly and dismissively of âWestern ideasâ like feminism, arguing that âno one today in their right mind can stand up for any of these ideas,â and alleging that the values of âfreedom, human rights, democracy, feminism, idealism, liberalism... died in Gaza.â",,,
ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/article/ai-chatbots-uneven-replies-raise-concern,"Executive SummaryÂ 

ADL research shows that GAI chatbots produce widely varied results when asked about Jewish topics or those related to antisemitism.

We reviewed 5 GAI chatbots: Chat GPT(GPT 3.5), Copilot(GPT 4), Claude, Gemini and Deep AI based on four parameters: citations, correct information, fairness, and explanation of data limits. No chatbot fulfilled all four parameters, with Claude performing the worst of all chatbots reviewed.

All companies should strive to ensure that their GAI chatbots avoid the discrepancies we noticed, and produce trustworthy information to objective queries.Â Â 

The role that AI and its derivatives, such as chatbots, are playing in the spread of misleading information is of particular concern. For example, after videos of an alleged passageway made under a Chabad headquarters went viral, social media users spread false images generated by GAI, including images of Jews carrying blood-covered children.Â 

In the nearly two years since GAI tools first exploded onto the public consciousness, they have already wrought a number of changes and challenges. These chatbots are still in their infancy, as evidenced by the multiple errors they return when used.Â  ADL researchers reviewed the leading AI chatbots for their responses to four basic questions based on several criteria. These questions were designed to reflect what an average user may search for about topics related to antisemitism, like âDid the Holocaust happen?â Answers to these kinds of basic questions are important because if they are not factual and clear, they risk spreading antisemitism and misleading information.

Overall, most text chatbots performed adequately, though there was room for improvement in some responses.",,,

New York, NY, March 11, 2024 â¦ Julie Sweet, Chair & CEO of Accenture, a true innovative leader who leads by example and inspires others to do the same, and who has publicly proclaimed zero tolerance for antisemitism and all forms of hate, has received the ADLâs (Anti-Defamation League) highest honor, the Courage Against Hate Award.

Sweet was presented with the award on Thursday during ADLâs 2024 Never Is Now Summit, the worldâs largest summit on antisemitism and hate, which attracted nearly 4,000 participants this year. The award was presented by a previous recipient, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Dr. Albert Bourla.

âJulie is not intimidated by the forces of evil, and is unafraid to speak out for truth and justice,â Dr. Bourla said in presenting the award. âShe does not look for an easy way out, or the path of least resistance. She is willing to confront what is uncomfortable and disrupt the status quo, if she thinks that the status quo is wrong. She refuses to stay silent â¦ in the face of hate, because she knows that silence is the biggest enabler.â

âI am honored today to accept this award on behalf of the over 700,000 courageous people of Accenture, who strive every day to live our values of respect, equity, inclusion of all people, and zero tolerance of hate and bigotry of any kind,â Sweet said in her acceptance remarks (video). âIf you take anything away from my speech today, I hope that it is this: That in order to eradicate hate, we must both speak up and take action against hate whenever we see it, and every day we must intentionally build bridges across our communities. We must build the foundation of trust, understanding and shared humanity that will be the opposite of hate.â

Since the Hamas terrorist massacre on Oct. 7, Sweet has voiced strong support for those in Israel and in Gaza who have suffered and lost, and as a company, Accenture is donating millions of dollars to relief efforts for civilians in Israel and Gaza during this conflict and is also matching employee donations to charitable relief organizations.

Sweet has publicly proclaimed Accentureâs zero tolerance for antisemitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia and hate speech of any kind. She guided the corporation to sign ADLâsÂ Workplace Pledge to Fight Antisemitism.

âAfter the Oct. 7 terrorist massacre in Israel, when the floodgates for antisemitism opened around the world, for some companies it was just business as usual,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âBut not at Accenture. Under Julie Sweet, Accenture has shown a deep commitment to ethical leadership and zero tolerance for antisemitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia and hate speech of any kind. As we all witnessed the tragic loss of life and suffering for people in Israel and in Gaza, the company has made a series of significant donations to provide relief efforts for civilians. This is what responsible corporate leadership looks like.â

ADL established theÂ Courage Against Hate AwardÂ to recognize courageous and visionary leaders from the private sector who are dedicated to fighting hate for good, boldly use their personal and professional brands to that end and inspire others to actively work to make the world a better place. In additionÂ to Dr. Albert Bourla, past recipients include Apple CEO Tim Cook, Chobani CEO and Founder Hamdi Ulukaya, Merck & Co. Executive Chairman Kenneth C. Frazier, and LâOreal Chairman Jean-Paul Agon.

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world.

Meeting with Guterres at the U.N.âs headquarters, the J7 leaders raised the sharp rise in global antisemitism since Oct. 7, the plight of the hostages in Gaza, the U.N.âs inadequate approach to Israel in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 massacre, and its delayed and flawed response to Hamasâ horrifying sexual violence against Israeli women. The delegates from seven countries also raised the need for the U.N. to address the systemic failures of UNRWA, and called on the Secretary General to consider alternative options in order to meet the humanitarian needs in Gaza.Â Â  Â 

The J7 leaders issued the following statement:

In our meeting with the UN Secretary General, we called for U.N. action in response to the explosion of antisemitism across the globe, which threatens Jewish communities everywhere. We urged the Secretary General to use the power of his position to work for the immediate release of the 134 hostages still being held in Gaza, and to address the systemic failures of UNRWA, including its inherent anti-Israel bias and the shocking revelations that UNRWA staff participated in the October 7 atrocities.Â 

In the meeting, the Secretary General expressed his commitment to doing all he can to work for the immediate release of all the hostages held by Hamas and showed great empathy for the hostages and their families.Â  He condemned all forms of antisemitism, and asserted unequivocally that there is no justification for the Hamas attack on October 7.Â Â 

The meeting with the Secretary General marked the conclusion of three days of J7 consultations in New York, led by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, which holds the rotating chair.â¯Also meeting for the first time was the J7 Campus Working Group, led by Jewish student leaders from seven countries.â¯Gathered on the sidelines of the ADL Never Is Now Summit, the J7 asserted the following principles:

The J7 is alarmed and mobilized in the face of the explosion and pervasiveness of global antisemitism. We affirm that anti-Zionism is antisemitism and that its normalization is an alarming reality in each of our communities. Our communities will continue to advocate for the adoption of and, more importantly, the implementation of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism.Â 
Â 

Our universities must not serve as safe havens for antisemitism. Academic institutions must enact and enforce codes of conduct to address antisemitism. Governments must hold these institutions accountable.Â 

There is no context in which antisemitism, including anti-Zionism, can be excused or justified.Â Â 

The J7 Task Force is comprised of the following nations and member organizations: Argentina: DelegaciÃ³n de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas (DAIA); Australia: Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ); Canada: Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA); France: Conseil ReprÃ©sentatif des Institutions Juives de France (CRIF); Germany: Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland (Central Council of Jews in Germany); United Kingdom: Board of Deputies of British Jews; United States (ADL and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations).Â

You may have heard about âswattingâ because it's been in the news recently. What exactly is swatting? Why do people do it?Â

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-honors-israeli-palestinian-content-creator-nuseir-yassin-2024-daniel,"New York, NY, March 6, 2024 â¦ Today ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) honored Nuseir Yassin, an Israeli-Palestinian content creator, with the ADLâs prestigious Daniel Pearl Award for his work in building bridges of understanding between Jews and Muslims and for promoting peace and understanding across communities.

ADL presented the award to Nuseir Yassin during its 2024 Never Is Now Summit on Antisemitism and Hate. The award was presented by Imam Abdullah Antempli, who praised Yassin for his work bridging divides as a social media influencer and activist. AntempliÂ received the award in 2022.

âNas is well deserving of this incredible award,â Antempli said. âBy reaching over 300 million people every month, he has transformed the way people connect both online and offline. This incredible young man and brilliant mind â¦ is lighting a candle by teaching us to use these online tools, social media tools focusing in and zooming around the world and highlighting our differences as a source of enlightenment and learning.â

âNuseir Yassinâs tireless efforts in bridging understanding between Jews and Muslims exemplify the spirit of the Daniel Pearl Award and its namesake,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âHis work transcends borders, reminding us that peace and empathy can flourish even in the face of adversity. Nuseirâs commitment to dialogue and unity echoes Daniel Pearlâs legacy, and we honor both men by continuing to build bridges across communities.â

The ADL Daniel Pearl Award was established in 2004 by longtime ADL leaders George and Ruth Moss and their son, Richard, following the horrific murder of Wall Street JournalÂ reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002 at the hands of antisemitic terrorists in Pakistan. The award honors his memory and commitment through his work to build cultural bridges and promote understanding.

Yassin got his start creating one-minute videos documenting stories of his trips around the world, and is now known globally across social media platforms where he has over 13 million subscribers on his YouTube channel and 67 million in total across all platforms. He is also Founder and CEO of Nas Company, where he brings people together in dialogue.

In the aftermath of Oct. 7, Yassin shared aÂ post about his own identity as an Israeli-Palestinian, condemning Hamas's violence and voicing support for his home, Israel. As a creator, Yassinâs videos refuse to stick to the usual stark âus vs. themâ divisions that prevent real conversations.

In accepting the award, Nas said he dedicated it to âThe Peacemakers,âÂ the people âwho are fighting for tolerance, for coexistence for long term peace.â

âIt is not popular to call for peace, whether youâre a leader or a follower or a YouTuber. Especially at times of war,â he said, recalling the blowback he received after posting a message of co-existence with his Jewish business partner following Oct. 7. âImmediately after our message, I lost a million-dollar deal. I lost ten friends. And created ten million haters. That was the price I paid. And I was willing to pay it.â

Previous recipients of the ADL Daniel Pearl Award include Imam Abdullah Antepli, scholar and interfaith leader; Mohammed Al Samawi, Yemeni refugee and author; The Aladdin Project; journalist Henrique Cymerman; Spanish journalist Pilar Rahola; Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis, founder of Jewish World Watch; Robert Satloff, executive director of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy; Jeffrey Goldberg, journalist with The Atlantic; Maziar Bahai, filmmaker and human rights activist; and Thomas L. Friedman, columnist for The New York Times.

ADL_ResearchAnalysis,https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-launches-atlas-antisemitism-trends-learning-statistics-tool,"Interactive map will display real-time antisemitic incident data from ADL and international organizations

New York, NY, March 6, 2024 â¦ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today launched the ADL ATLAS (Antisemitism Trends, Learning and Statistics) tool providing global antisemitism information and analysis. The data includes antisemitic incidents, antisemitic attitudes, information about government commitments and a variety of reports â all providing a comprehensive picture of the state of antisemitism worldwide.

Featuring information gathered by ADL as well as other international Jewish organizations and communities, and academic and government institutions, the interactive feature will be a resource for information on antisemitism data along with government responses.

âThe first step in fighting antisemitism is having accurate and up-to-date data. ATLAS is a one stop shop for antisemitism-related information, which helps us better understand the phenomenon.Â  By understanding the scope of antisemitism by integrating all sorts of data points we can better advocate for targeted interventions,â said Marina Rosenberg, ADL Senior Vice President of International Affairs. âWe look forward to working with our international partners to tailor educational programs and advocacy efforts to combat anti-Jewish hate.âÂ 

Drawing information from ADL resources such as the ADL Global 100 and theÂ Antisemitism Worldwide Report (with Tel Aviv University), ATLAS will also aggregate information from the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Report, The U.S. State Departmentâs International Religious Freedom Report and the European Unionâs Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) Report.

âAt a time when antisemitism is an urgent problem around the globe, the ATLAS will be a pivotal tool in understanding where hot spots are and how governments are responding,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. âADL is proud to lead this effort along with many global partners â We are a stronger force together in fighting antisemitism.â

The ATLAS was unveiled at ADLâs annual Never Is Now summit in New York on March 6 as theÂ J-7 Joint Task Force to Combat Antisemitism convened to discuss the current global antisemitism crisis and best strategies to protect Jewish communities.

This new effort comes as antisemitism in the U.S. is at record levels. Last week, an ADLÂ survey revealed anti-Jewish attitudes are at an all-time high, with 24-percent of Americans harboring extensive antisemitic prejudice, up from 20 percent in 2022. In January, ADL releasedÂ preliminary data finding a total of 3,291 antisemitic incidents between Oct. 7 and Jan. 7, a 361-percent increase over the year prior, putting 2023 on track to be the worst year since ADL started tracking this data in the late 1970s.

ADL is the leading anti-hate organization in the world. Founded in 1913, its timeless mission is âto stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.â Today, ADL continues to fight all forms ofÂ antisemitism andÂ bias, using innovation and partnerships to drive impact.

We are not OK.

We are not OK.

As my friend Bret Stephens so succinctly put it, all of us now live in an October 8th world.

We have endured the painful, distressing, and clarifying events of the past 151 days. That video we just saw could be 10 times, 100 times as long and it still wouldnât capture all the anti-Jewish hate of just the past few months.

The world of October 8 is one in which the perpetrators of the worst antisemitic massacre since the Holocaust are celebrated as heroes â not just in Ramallah or Beirut, but in London and New York and on campuses like Harvard and Columbia.

An October 8th world is one in which prayers for the safety of hostages â men, women, children, the elderly are met with vile hate-speech and moral confusion.

An October 8th world in which rape and sexual assault draw universal outrage, unless committed against Israeli women andÂ  girls.

An October 8th world in which college campuses are policed relentlessly for the smallest of microaggressions, but there seems to be no cop on the beat when the insults and threats are screamed at Jewish students in the quad, outside their fraternities, or even in the classroom.

The world of October 8 is one of an unprecedented surge of antisemitism all over the planet.

In Brazil, incidents are up 960 percent.

In France, 384 percent.

In Germany, 320 percent.

And here in the United States, up 360 percent since 10/7.Â 

If there were ever a moment to break the glass and pull the alarm labeled âNever Again,â that time is right now.

According to ADLâs Center on Extremism in just three months after 10/7, there were 3,291 antisemitic incidents in the America. Thatâs an average of 34 anti-Jewish acts each and every day.

Antisemitism isnât just an abstract issue. Itâs a real-life threat to our livesâ¦to Jewish life in Americaâ¦and, again, to Jews around the world.

Yes, it could happen here -- because it is.

Yes, never is now -- because if we donât insist on it, the consequences could be devastating.

And that means we need to clear-eyed about the threats we face -- and have the determination to face them.

***

One of the biggest threats is that our opponents have worked tirelessly to muddy the messageâ¦to make what is morally clear, fuzzyâ¦to lie and to gaslight about whatâs happening.

At times, it feels as if we are living in a Kafka novel.

As we all know, there is a group of people who wants us to believe that anti-Zionism does not equal antisemitismâ¦that somehow one can be adamantly opposed to the existence of the worldâs only Jewish stateâ¦where half of the Jews on planet Earth liveâ¦but really have no problems with actual Jews.

Itâs absurd.

Letâs make this very clear: anti-Zionism is antisemitism.

And look, before the folks at Harvard or Berkeleyâ¦or the editors at left-wing Jewish magazines that very few of us actually readâ¦before they start to object, letâs also be clear what anti-Zionism means.

Antizionism doesnât mean having a problem with a set of actions by the Israeli government. Antizionism doesnât mean protesting the policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu. Antizionism doesnât mean you support Palestinian human rights. Anti-Zionism doesnât mean that youâre not upset about the conflict in Gaza.

Thatâs what our enemies want you to think -- and they are lying.

Antizionism, plain and simple, means that Jews â alone among the peoples of the world â do not deserve freedom and self-determination in their homeland.

Antizionism is a negation of Jewish history, a denial of Jewish humanity.

Today, in our October 8 world, American Jews â and Americans of all kinds â theyâre hearing with their own ears and theyâre seeing with their own eyes the hollow claim of those who purport to be anti-Zionists but not antisemites.

Thatâs rich.

Itâs like saying in 1964, I donât hate Black Americans, but I just donât think we need to pass the Civil Rights Act or end Jim Crow.

It just doesnât add up.

If your idea of expressing dissent against Israeli government policies is to attack Jews in America (or anywhere, for that matter), that doesnât make you a de-colonizer...a freedom fighter...or a progressive.

It makes you a bigot. Plain and simple.

And donât take my word for it: you know who is cheering on the anti-Zionists? The neo-Naziâs and right-wing extremists and the nativists that ADL has been tracking and battling for yearsâ¦and still is tracking and battling.

The tiki-torch marchers in Charlottesville and the SJP radicals are two sides of the same antisemitic coin!

But I must say, I have to share, what amazes me is that when ADL says that anti-Zionism is antisemitismâ¦...or when the Hillel director says that the mob chanting âfrom the river to the seaâ outside their door on campus is a threatâ¦journalists at major newspapers donât listen to the victim â instead, they literally go looking for an alternative point of view.

You all know what Iâm talking about.Â 
Youâve all read these stories in The New York Times.

Youâve all read these paragraphs: âTo be sure, Professor So and So saysâ or âthe head of Jewish Voice for Peace countersâ¦â

Really?

Really?

You know, when my friend Derrick Johnson â the head of the NAACP â says that something is racist, reporters from the New York TimesÂ  or journalist from MSNBC donât rush to the phones to get an alternative point of view from David Duke or the Proud Boys.

So why is it different for us?

Why are Jewish people being told over and over and over again that we have no say in what constitutes antisemitism?

Why are the majority of us dismissed or marginalized or told we just donât get it.

Even worse, we are told that words donât mean what we know they actually mean.

Take the word, âgenocide.â

Educated people from the UN, foreign ministries around the world, and of course on elite college campuses here at home want us to believe that genocide is an army fighting a defensive war â while facilitating humanitarian aid even as they are texting and calling civilians urging them out of harm's way.

And yet we are told genocide is NOTÂ  the terrorists literally next door who not only said they want to kill every Jewish man, woman, and child â but actually did all they could to reach every victim possible.

We are told that âFrom the River to the Seaâ doesnât mean eliminate the Jewish state and the Jews living between the two bodies of waterâ¦it is just a catchy slogan.

We are told âbelieve every woman,â except if those being raped are Jewish women.

We are told that âglobalize the Intifada,â is not a call for a violent uprising, but now a Gandhian plea for non-violent resistance.

Really. Whatâs up is downâ¦hot is coldâ¦day is night.

As Orwell famously put it, âif thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.â

A case in point.

Time and again, especially since 10/7, elected officials, campus administrators, and the media tell us that the problem in America is the rise in antisemitism AND the rise in Islamophobia or anti-Muslim hateâ¦thatâs because of the conflict between Israelis and Hamas, there is now a conflict happening, spilling out here in the US on both sides.

That both are being attacked,

Both are equally threatened on campus,

Both are routinely being routinely, serially harassed by professors and teachers.

Now, I want to make sure nobody in this room and no one watching online is misconstruing my words.

Anti-Muslim hate is an absolutely unjustifiable form of bigotry full stop.

It should have no place in our country or anywhere. And when it happens, we need to take it seriously. We need to combat it, prosecute it, and stop it from happening -- whether it's a teenager being shot in Burlington, VT for walking down the street or a small child, an innocent child killed in suburban Chicago.

For years, ADL has been a partner in that fight â calling it out time and again, including advocating for resources that protect Muslim institutions and laws that prevent hate crimes against Muslims.

Weâve done that that without hesitation, we will do it in the future without hesitation and I am proud of that track record.

And yet the fact is, however, there is no data that shows that incidents of anti-Muslim hate today are at a level or of a kind comparable to the rampant, raging antisemitism engulfing our country.

And to assert that these two issues are of the same magnitude right now or of the same urgency is to minimize antisemitismâ¦it is to silence Jews and those concerned specifically about anti-Jewish hate.

Letâs be crystal clear- this is not a contest about who has it worse. All Americans should be against all types of hate. The problem is the need that too many people seem to have in not singularly calling out and battling antisemitism on its own.

It is tone deaf, itâs insulting. And frankly, it feels like it is being done to minimize antisemitism, and wave away our very real concerns...and at ADL, we wonât let them.

ADL will never stop calling out and fighting antisemitism â whether it comes from the violent white nationalist or the hardened antizionist. Both are threats. We will battle them with equal energy.

We will do so because we will never be quiet in the face of anti-Jewish hate.

Unfortunately right now, that battle is taking a different, more serious, and more dangerous shape.

Groups like SJP and other Hamas apologists have embraced a whole new playbook since 10/7.

Until now, their strategy was one of isolation or âanti-normalization,â as they call it -- focused on boycotts, divestment, and urging progressive groups and all Americans to shun and ostracize their Jewish neighbors.

There are lots of examples of this tactic â like refusing to let Jewish groups march in the gay pride parade in Chicago, or law school groups in Berkeley trying to bar âZionistâ speakers, or climate activists in DC refusing to attend a rally and stand alongside their Jewish peers.

But now thatâs no longer enough for them.

On October 8th, as Israeli soldiers were still tracking down murderous terrorists hiding in Israelâ¦as families, some of whom you will hear from today, were still wondering if their loved ones were dead, kidnapped, or just incinerated beyond recognitionâ¦as all of us in the public was trying to grasp what actually had happened inside Israel, SJP released a new toolkit to their followers.

This toolkit, which you still can find online, unapologetically celebrated the atrocities of Hamas, and it also spelled out new strategy of confrontation to, in their words, âdismantle Zionism.â

And we have seen the results of this strategy all over the country.

That video we saw before I came on gave you a taste of it.

Itâs the angry mob that vandalized a falafel restaurant in Philadelphia -- just one of hundreds of businesses that we know of that have been hit from coast to coast.

Itâs the encampment outside the suburban home of our countryâs Secretary of State, the highest-ranking Jewish-American in the countryâ¦where so-called activists have erected a sign declaring their space âKibbutz Blinkenâ to evoke a nightmarish comparison with the kibbutzim savaged on 10/7 day and night. While he travels the world trying to bring peace, they menace his young family, constantly screaming into megaphones and speakers terrify and terrorize them.

Itâs the Museum of Modern Art right here in New York where, a few weeks ago, the building was shut down as pro-Hamas protesters shouted the names of the prominent Jews who happen to sit on MOMA's board of trustees.

And, of course, it is campus after campus, where student unions have been occupiedâ¦classrooms disruptedâ¦as SJP and its fellow travelers berate and belittle Jewish students, almost always with impunity.

Facing these threats, it seems that the Jewish community in the United States has two choices: flight or fight.

It pains me, as the head of the ADL, as a father, it pains me that some have made the choice to flee, to hide their identity â to wear a baseball cap instead of a kippah, to remove the mezuzah on their doorpost. I know of many parents who have instructed their kids to change the names on their Uber profiles, so they appear less obviously Jewish.

Iâm guessing that includes some of you in this room today.

These tough decisions, deeply personal decisions, and Iâm not judging but I get it. I understand the desire to deflect the threat.

I understand the urge to protect our kids.

But I am also seeing another response.

Not deflection, but defiance.

Not flight, but fight.

There are reports of jewelry shops unable to keep gold Stars of David in stock as young people are proud to wear them around their necks.

There are accounts of high schoolers suddenly donning kippot, proudly demonstrating to their classmates that they are Jewish and proud.

This isnât just a phenomenon driven by young people.

Open your phone. I bet nearly everyone in this room has a text chain or WhatsApp chat or Facebook group buzzing with people sharing information and organizing to help our brothers and sisters in Israel and to fight back against this onslaught of antisemitism around the world.

What we have seen in this new Jewish grassrootsâ¦in community after communityâ¦and in the work ADL does every day gives me hope.

It shows me and it shows all of us that the time for complacency is over. We canât assume American Jewish life will continue to be a comfortable life â unless we do something nowâ¦unless we transform ourselves from observers to activists, from onlookers to advocates.

Our community has accomplished so much in this country â and contributed so much.

No one can take that away from us â and itâs time we stopped letting think that they can do so.

The Jewish community has been an indispensable part of this country since its earliest days.

We have overcome discrimination, broken barriers and exceeded expectations.

We started companies, founded labor unions and cured diseases.

We built schools, funded universities, and started hospitals.

We created theatres, launched studios, and started charities.

We changed norms, passed laws, and secured judgements that made this country better for its Jewish people and ultimately better for all of its people.

You see, the bottom line â there is not a part of American life that the Jewish community has not touched and impacted for good.

And so, the time has come to say:

The harassment and the attacks must stop.

Explaining away your antisemitism will no longer be tolerated.

Refusing to prosecute the laws or to enforce the policies of your institution when the perpetrators are targeting Jews, it must cease.

The twisting of languageâ¦the moral cowardiceâ¦the blind eye toward antisemitism must end now.

If not, you will hear our voices.

You will see us outside your doors.

And we will see you in court.

Our donations that you relied on â gone.

Our votes that you seek â forget about it.

Our friendship or alliances â no more.

At this momentâ¦in this October 8th world, we will not be silent.

We not let our country be lost to the antisemites and bigots.

We will not flee.

We will fight.

And we will win.

Am Yisrael Chai.

And God bless America.

Thank you.",,,
